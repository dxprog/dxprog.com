Fujibayashi Ryou and Furukawa Nagisa from the visual novel/anime CLANNAD (both thouroughly enjoyable).

This is a big step up for me being that there are TWO characters here. I managed to draw this within the same amount of time I generally draw one, so either I cut a lot of corners or I'm getting better. Also, I tried going for a softer style of shading which was, in my opinion, somewhat successful. Hair shading still throws me for a loop, but I'm getting better at everything else.

Characters and such are owned by KEY.
