This is based off of a screen grab from the opening of CLANNAD After Story. It was so beautiful, I wanted to try and make it desktop size. The line art was traced over a screen grab, but all the coloring was done by me. I think I picked up a bunch of lighting/coloring tips as I was making this that I hope to incorporate into future arts.

Nagisa Furukawa and CLANNAD are owned by KEY.

Sub-note: The opening theme for After Story is one of the best pieces of music I've heard this year.
