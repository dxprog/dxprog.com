It's been over two years since I actually completed a full art piece, one if you take into consideration [my last comic](http://dxprog.com/comic/puntacular/). So, when I recently promised the fine folk of [/r/awwnime](http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime) some _OC_, I backed myself into the corner of actually having to draw something.

Around the same time I made that promise, I was introduced to a little show called [Humanity Has Declined](http://www.crunchyroll.com/humanity-has-declined). On the surface, it looks like one of those cute girl shows that I enjoy more than I'd care to admit, but in reality, it's a dark satire. Watashi, our intrepid protagonist pictured above, is a girl who acts as the liaison between humans and the "future humanity", or faeries. She's super cynical, which is awesome.

On the artwork itself, I'm actually relatively at ease with this one. I feel like I avoided the usual lumpiness (and had Chris confirm that for me). I decided to take it easy on the shading for the sake of easiness, but also to mimic the style of the show. Very clean and simple. I like. You can also [check out the process](http://imgur.com/a/WKVlc) to final product.

Not bad for two years of doing nothing.
