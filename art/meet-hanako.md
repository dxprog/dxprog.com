An attempt to break away from the "draw what I see" and start hammering away at my skills. I've been doing a fair amount of drawing the last week or so and subconsciously kept drawing the same character. Once I realized this, I decided that perhaps she can become my OC and drew this. Her name is Hanako, which means "flower child".

I'm beginning to see progress in terms of anatomical accuracy, but still have many issues to work out. The hands and feet I'm fairly satisfied with as well as the legs (though, there's some work to be done). The arms and shoulders, however, are what I see as the glaring issue here. Also, the shape of the lower half of the face. Things to address as I continue my grind quest to become a level 80 artist.
