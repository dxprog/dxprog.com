A little something something I made for achieving 5000 page views on my illustrious [deviantArt profile](http://dxprog.deviantart.com/).

Overall, I think this is probably one of my better ventures, though my brother says my art style is "lumpy". I cannot disagree. And hands? They're such a pain in the ass to draw. Like I was saying on the way into bowling last night, drawing would be so much easier if we had no hands and arms/legs were simple rectangles. Yes, it would make awesome things like eating and playing Tetris Attach much more difficult, but people would be easier to draw.

Wait... with no hands I couldn't draw...

Damn.
