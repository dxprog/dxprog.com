Kirino Kousaka of "My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute" fame, drawn for the ANN Go to Japan contest. Sadly, I have not actually begun to watch this show (was busy finishing out Toradora!), but it certainly is high on my list.

I'd say that this is, to date, the fanciest piece I've attempted over all (color, background, pose, etc). Arguably, I think I may have missed on the pose, but moving out of one's comfort zone is how one improves.
