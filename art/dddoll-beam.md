This was a request from some dude on deviantArt. I'll admit, I don't get the premise of characters turning into dolls (which there is a whole [group](http://turn-into-a-doll.deviantart.com/) dedicated to), but this piece proved an interesting challenge.

I used reference for the first stage (on the left) and made up the doll based upon that. Then, I had to essentially tween the middle image (in animator speak).

Created using my usual method of pencil, Illustrator and Photoshop.
