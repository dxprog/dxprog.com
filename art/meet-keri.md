I decided to break away from direct copying for a bit to apply the techniques I've learned over the last few days. What I came up with was Keri, my new OC.

I'm pretty happy with how this came out, only a few complaints about the eyes and shape of the face. For the shading, I used the artwork of [MoogleGurl](http://mooglegurl.deviantart.com/)  as a reference for shading and background (check out her stuff. It's super cute).

Well, I hope you like it. At this stage, critiques are extremely welcome.

Tools used:
