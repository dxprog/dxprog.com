A picture that evolved from something I sketched during a long meeting at work.

So, this is the second time Hanako has made an appearance in a completed picture. And, lucky me, she decided to bundle up all nice to prevent me from having to draw limbs and digits. Arigatou, Hanako! Sadly, she did forget her hat and now the snow is piling up atop her head.

Inked in Sai and colored in Photoshop.
