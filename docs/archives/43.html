<p>RedditBots Source: [ <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/RedditBots">Download</a> ]</p>
<p>One day, somewhere between Christmas and New Years, a coworker of mine was musing out loud about a vanity reddit account he had created. He was describing exactly what it would do and I was like &quot;dude. We can automate that.&quot; So, in a fury of coding and some poring over reddit documentation, I pulled together a very simple bot that did exactly what he had described. Slapped it on an every ten minutes cron job and called it a day. The code was ugly and I vowed to make a nicer version.</p>
<p>That I did and, while I was at it, decided that I should make it a simple framework with which I could bots in a simple manner and have a central script that managed them all. The above source is what I settled on (complete with a working, if not banned, version of a binky79 clone).</p>
<p>My own bot idea, as it was Christmas, was for a bot named Ebeneezer_McUpvote (a portmanteau of Ebenezer Scrooge, Scrooge McDuck and everyone&#39;s favorite reddit term, upvote) to randomly upvote a new link and add the comment &quot;Merry Christmas! Have an upvote ^ _ Q&quot;. Scripted, running, would execute every five minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Ebeneezer_McUpvote">People hate it.</a></p>
<p>As of this writing, that bot has -310 comment karma. Now here&#39;s where the fickleness of reddit shows through.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as I was browsing, I came upon <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ogjx1/its_439pm_saturday_in_australia_i_am_drunkthis_is/">this post</a>. So, Oprah giving random upvotes is considered cool, eh?</p>
<p>Enter, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/OprahGivesAnUpvote">OprahGivesAnUpvote</a>. She does pretty much EXACTLY the same thing as Ebeneezer_McUpvote, only she says &quot;Look under your chair... you got an UPVOOOOOOOOTE!!&quot;. People love her. OprahGivesAnUpvote has, at this writing, 233 comment karma and she&#39;s only been running since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Why the hatred? I dunno. Maybe people don&#39;t get the joke of Ebeneezer_McUpvote. Maybe the joke just sucks. Maybe it&#39;s not Christmas anymore. Either way, Oprah is loved, McUpvote is not. I&#39;ll be interested to see if Ebeneezer&#39;s fortune turns around when we get closer to Christmas again...</p>

<p>Well, here we are again. It&#39;s always such a pleasure. Remember when I did this <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done/">last year</a>? I do. Seems like it wasn&#39;t that long ago. But, time flies, as they say, and with increasing age, it does so with increased velocity, it seems. This calls for some retrospective and forward contemplation.

So, here they are and we&#39;ll see you on the other side!</p>
<h2 id="best-show-of-2011">Best Show of 2011</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - Steins;Gate</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_steins_gate.jpg" alt="" title="Steins;Gate">
Time travel stories are amazing, and this is something I&#39;ve always known.  However, Steins Gate -- a show I started watching out of idle curiosity - has confirmed how badass I think they are.  Why is that, exactly?  Sit your ass down and I&#39;ll tell you.  </p>
<p>Like all good time travel stories, the show starts out all, &quot;Huh?&quot; then proceeds to, &quot;Ah!&quot; and ends on a &quot;I FUCKING UNDERSTAND <em>EVERYTHING</em> NOW.&quot;  You know what really helps these temporal feelings along?  A refreshing cast of badass and well developed characters -- surprisingly light on school girls -- teams up with the plot to create a story so badass that you will sit down on the stoop of your Manhattan apartment and think like a <em>GODDAMN MAN</em>.</p>
<p>Convinced yet?  Not enough info for your tastes?  TOUGH SHIT.  Absorb it through every orifice and be glad you did.

<h4>Best Character</h4>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Chris - Rintarou Okabe (<em>Steins;Gate</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_okarin.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>Rintarou Okabe -- aka, mad scientist Hououin Kyouma -- is the main element that makes Steins; Gate amazing.</p>
<p>Okabe starts off over the top, telling everybody he&#39;s a mad scientist and making grand claims about a secret organization that&#39;s keeping tabs on him.  Over the course of the show, however, you see him develop into a very troubled character as the show&#39;s events begin to take their toll on him.  This depth later on really makes you feel for him as a character.</p>
<p>But you know what the best part is?  He&#39;s an ass most of the time, but in a good way, asserting himself over his supposed suboordinates in an over the top fashion.</p>
<p>Gotta love it.</p>

That is, the end of the year and the beginning of another. As has become a normal thing for my website, I am here doing reviews of anime series I watched during the year. However, I will be changing it up a bit and instead of reviewing everything, things will be done in a categorized award fashion. Joining me again this year are my brothers Jeff and Chris. So, without further ado, let&#39;s begin!</p>

<strong>Chris - First half of the first episode of We Without Wings</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I watched the first episode of this show because I wanted to see some mad panty shots.  What did I get?  An initial two minutes of fan service that made _me_ uncomfortable, followed by ten minutes of a couple of dick weeds in a bar having a boring ass conversation.</p>
<p>I will never get those twelve minutes of my life back.
