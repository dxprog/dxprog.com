Should your mouth perpetually have a bar of soap strapped to it? Well then you're reading the right column. Hi, I'm Dr. Matt.

Over the last three years my team and I have come up with a simple solution to all swearing problems. It is a simple matter of appended or prepending letters or phrases onto said bad word to make it kid friendly. Let's have an example:

 "What the hell is that?!"

Doesn't sound very nice, does it? Now let's see the same phrase after applying Dr. Matt's pateneted cuss removing technology.

 "What the shell is that?!"

Much nicer, no? The following table contains a list of beautified words that you can use any day in front of anybody (except the pope): 

bass
mustard
witch/itch
ship
crab
freak/frickin' (funk has also been suggested, but that burders too close...)

In certain situations a letter won't work and you will actually have to say the word, however, after much research it was found that the word "Hoover" can aleviate sid problem. Examples:

Hoover Dam
sucks like a Hoover

Ans there you have it. Practice these steps everyday and you'll be on the road to verbal maturity in no time. Have a great day :-)</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/for-the-sailors">For the sailors</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 10, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Do you have a filty mouth?

It&#x27;s the winds of change...</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 5, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content">In what could be marked as a pardigm shift for me I have purchased my first "real" song off of iTunes, meaning it is a modern rock song. Now the song, which I will name, I've heard plenty of times at Wal-Mart (as much as one can hear it over *beep* *beep* *beep* and all the chatter), but I suppose I have devusb to thank for it in the end. Using some iTunes VPN thingy I was digging through his music this morn and I was able to listen to the entire song and found, horror of horrors, I actually liked it. This leads me to wonder if I shouldn't broaden my musical horizons just a hair.... But anyhoo, you're probably wondering what song could cause such a cataclysmic shift in such a humble being as myself. It's "[Dirty Little Secret](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=73648639&s=143441&i=73648643)" by the All-American Rejects.

In job news I am going to be blunt and to the point: the deptartment managing specialist job SUCKS! That said I am going to beg to have my cashier job back by May. I can't stand this job anymore. The hours (and lack thereof) stink, the lack of human interaction is driving me insane and a couple of other reasons I will leave unsaid (to save my job and reputation). Had I realized that this is how things were going to be I would have stopped complaining about my cashier job and been happy. We'll see how things go down, though.

Well, that's enough for now. In about fifteen minutes I have to be at the eye doctor's for an appointment. Stay tuned for my next post where I'll do a little bit of ranting again (yay! ;-)).
