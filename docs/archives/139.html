I say it that way because I&#39;m not actually doing what I was hired to do. No, I&#39;ve been stocking coffee the last three days (not today, because I was off). I guess my training will start on Thursday at roughly 8am. More on that as things develop....</p>
<p>Now for my ranting. Whoo! Lately, my mom has been calling pregnant gals &quot;prego&quot;. &quot;That gal&#39;s prego&quot;, &quot;Oh, is she prego?&quot;. ARRGGHHH! It drives me nuts! Prego is a blasted spaghetti sauce for crying in ship!! Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prego">Wikipedia says so</a>! So the next time you hear somebody disgrace the name of licensed marinara sauce in such a way, do me a favor and say &quot;Yes, that is some fine eatin&#39;!&quot;</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/screw-blogger">SCREW BLOGGER!!!</a></h1><time class="post__published">March 17, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>After writing a beautiful, heartfelt post on Blogger and having it lost because it was never able to upload the stupid thing, I am now using Wordpress. It&#39;s completely in house (i.e. on my server) and shouldn&#39;t have any of these inane issues. Now, on to that heartfelt entry :-).</p>
<p>Today, Friday, March 17th marks my official last day as a cashier. Starting at 4am on Saturday I will be an Overstock Manager*. Al I looking forward to it? Yes, yes I am. Not only is the cashier job driving me insane right now, but it&#39;ll be nice ot have my day back again. I plan on using the extra time to start working towards my GED. I hereby solemnly swear that I, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Scott_Hackmann">Matthew Scott Hackmann</a> will obtain my GED before May 1st, 2006. There, it&#39;s in magnetic bits, can&#39;t back out now. It really is something that needs to be done, and Wally World will reimburse me anything I spend on it too :-).</p>
<p>My emulator is coming along quite nicely, though there are more annoying hurdles to get over yet. I can basically say that Mario Bros. and Metroid are completely playable (last I checked). Zelda and Stringer (my two new scrolling test apps) are still buggy (like it&#39;s on the wrong table all the time), but otherwise everything is looking pretty sweet. However, I&#39;m going to hold off for now while I pursue a new project.</p>
<p>My Uncle Dave (hey dude :-D) was nice enough to give me his old Handspring Visor (circa 1999) and that will be my new programming toy. The only thing I really have in mind for it right now is an app to take to bowling to score games and give statistical reports on the fly. Luckily Palm has all their development stuff opened up so that&#39;ll make it much easier.</p>
<p>I can now say I&#39;ve played Doom on my iPod. Last week, while still swept up in the initial &quot;wow! this is cool&quot;-ness of the whole iPod thing, I installed Linux on it and played Doom. However, it was borking up music playback on the Apple side of it so I toasted Linux and have my music playing greatness back. I&#39;m really getting into podcasts, my favorites being <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73329404&amp;s=143441">this WEEK in TECH (TWiT)</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=87819353&amp;s=143441">RevoGaming.net</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=74169891&amp;s=143441">Diggnation</a> (gotta love Kevin Rose). Also, I bought an album full of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=91158108&amp;s=143441">SpongeBob goodness</a> and the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=54796297&amp;s=143441&amp;i=54795627">theme</a> from Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy (for you old timers, the original <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1054520&amp;s=143441&amp;i=1054517">Eagles</a> version).</p>
<p>Well, I believe that&#39;s all I needed to say. Just remember, vote for Pedro and all your wildest dream will come true :-).</p>

So here&#39;s the new address (temporary): <a href="http://dxprog.blogspot.com">http://dxprog.blogspot.com</a>. Once I have my new hosting and old blog posts moved over I&#39;ll have the dxprog.com address back - Matt &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>

You can upload your face and have it match it against a database full of celebreties. Well, I dumped a picture of me and and apprently I look like Tim Berners-Lee :-D (actually there is a striking resemblene). Now isn&#39;t that cool :-). See ya and have fun.</p>

As you can see the archives list is now sorted in descending order and I also have a little links bar (I can add as many side bars as I want too :-)). Also, fixed a few problems in the message board code and cleaned up a couple other things that had been bothering me for months.</p>
<p>I got my USBC card today which brings to to the following important note: tomorrow is bowling again. YAY! After that I&#39;ll be working three days and then get Saturday off. YAY! Then I&#39;ll work Sunday and I&#39;ll be off again. YAY! (I &#39;spect that&#39;s getting annoyiing :-P).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all I wanted to say. But before I go I&#39;ll give a shout out to my coworker buddy, Blake! :-D See ya :-)</p>
