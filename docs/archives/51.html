I suppose I can just ramble.</p>
<p>My Wal-Mart experiences of late have not been of the highest caliber. Granted, one doesn&#39;t usually expect world class service at the World of Walls, but this has been exceedingly blah. Cashiers who just don&#39;t give a shit, seem to be high out of their mind or cannot comprehend the English language are what greet me at my new Wal-Mart. Though, I just left my old one, full of good people whom I mostly know, after having gotten the worst cashier yet.</p>
<p>I was there to pick up the new Weird Al album (which was not in the new releases as it should have been) and made a bee line to express lane with the shortest queue. The cashier, some teenager named Jace, was trying to open his drawer, an action that locks up the register until a CSM has approved it from their keypad. Problem number one - you don&#39;t lock up your register when there are customers waiting and you don&#39;t have to. He then proceeded to get exceedingly pissed off, swearing and smashing the clear button on his keyboard. He was honestly becoming quite violent.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand his frustration with slow CSM response and the slowness to back out of an action on the aging registers. I&#39;ve been on both sides of of that equation. However, he did unessecarily bring it upon himself and his display of frustration was absolutely not professional.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I guess this post became a rant about my Wal-Mart experience, but it still counts.</p>

Today, I am going to pass on my tried and true formula to you, my adoring Internet audience.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step1.jpg" alt="" title="The human slice-n-dice, I am">
Chop some onion, celery and carrots. This is known in the culinary world as <em>mirepoix</em>.</p>
<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step2.jpg" alt="" title="Much sizzling happens here">
Saute your <em>mirepoix</em> in some olive oil along with spices and other things.</p>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step3.jpg" alt="" title="MAGIC!">
Apply a healthy dose of magic. This step is critical and you mustn&#39;t get it wrong lest you create a hideous food beast.</p>
<h2 id="step-4">Step 4</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step4.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s good enough to each, which is good. It is food, after all.">
Enjoy over some thin spaghetti. Not that fat stuff. Ideally, you&#39;d also have Parmesan cheese, though I sadly did not for this instance.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now can make your own BFSS to woo over whomever you please!</p>

This got me to realizing that I&#39;ve coded this particular game to some varying level to completion five times now, six if you include the yet to be written iPad version.</p>
<p>Six times. And now you&#39;ll get the code for a good many of those.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tattack_old.jpg" alt="" title="Bask in its shittiness">
Source: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/TAttackOld.zip">Download</a>
My first shot for a TAttack clone didn&#39;t make it too far. It was little more of a see-if-I-could attempt. Written in Visual Basic and using GDI for graphics, there&#39;s not much to see here except how terrible it is.
