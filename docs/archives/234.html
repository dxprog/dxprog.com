I'm sure you're all thinking because we're moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).

But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It's not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.

Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I'm in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game [here.](http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test)

I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I'm not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let's face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I'm sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you're interested in helping check out the [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org).</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/the-ship-is-about-to-hit-the-fan">The ship is about to hit the fan</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 24, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Got a call this morning from our realtor.

<p>In other news, Steve&#39;s Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It&#39;ll be nice to have something to play again.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)</p>

Tryblithe, owner of [CT Square](http://www.ctsquare.net) web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it's all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it's much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that's pretty cool :-)

Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that's about all there is to report there.

Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That's right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought "Hey, this looks kind of cool". But I've been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is "We're coming soon!", "Almost there...", "blah blah blah...". One of their so called "storez" was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here's is Amazon's reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:

[quote]"At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
web site.  

Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
their site."[/quote]

Yeah, real legit :-P.

Okay, I'll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)
