Of course, we should all know by now that CMS programming is child&#39;s play for me. However, seeing as my final project for this class <em>is</em> a CMS with front end, I&#39;m taking this opportunity to redesign stuff, and by stuff I mean everthing (even beyond the site itself). Some things to expect from the next iteration:</p>

At the end of this month our final 3D project wound up in an awesome culmination of 3D animation and my favorite motion program, After Effects. The result? See for yourself.</p>
