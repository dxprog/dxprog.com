<p>You would make me read something emotional at work. I&#39;ll get you for that &gt;_&gt;. But now on to seriousness.</p>
<p>The last twenty-five years have certainly been an experience. Be it good times, bad times or anything in between, you guys have always been there and, more importantly, we&#39;ve always been together no matter the situation. I don&#39;t think I can convey just how important that has been to me, but I can certainly tell you that it has helped to shape my very core. Even just the simple act of eating together and conversing about whatever is something that I&#39;ve especially come to appreciate the last few years, something I will sorely miss.</p>
<p>The other item I specifically want to express my gratitude for is your openness. Being open about situations in the family, open about the pursuit of my passions, open about your thoughts on whatever situation I had to throw at you. I cannot tell you how important it&#39;s been to me and my development as a person to experience the world for what it is, not through some rose-colored, sheltered glasses. Has it always been easy? Fuck no, that&#39;s not how the world works! But like was said, we learn from mistakes, be it our own or others and I&#39;ve certainly learned a lot just from failing and I plan to continue to fail and learn from those failures in the future.</p>
<p>I also want to apologize myself for all the dumbass things that I&#39;ve done, both as a child and as an adult who should know better. So, for every hole I put in a wall, every object I&#39;ve thrown, every hurtful word I&#39;ve ever uttered, every bear I freed from a baby mobile: I&#39;m sorry.</p>
<p>You guys are the most kick ass family that I could possibly ever have asked for and I love all of you. I only hope that I can raise my own family to be a fraction as awesome as you all have been.</p>
<p>Rock on!</p>

<p>P.S. I was trying to choke the life out of that cat. It doesn&#39;t look it, but there was malicious intent &gt;_&gt;</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Art Battle - Fighting Small Children for my Ego</h2><time>April 30, 2011</time><div><p>I&#39;m moving in mid-May, apartment has been procured and packing has begun. Now that all that&#39;s out of the way, let&#39;s focus on more important things.</p>
<p>Through various happenings and goings on, two of my brothers and I challenged each other to a drawing contest of sorts. We would each choose a picture to draw and all three of us would have to draw said pictures. Over the course of three hours this afternoon we engaged in the most passive aggressive combat of all time.</p>
<p>Before I leap into the pictures themselves, a quick overview of who my challengers were. First was my 14-year-old brother Steve and second was my 11-year-old brother Joe. Was this a fair fight with me being 24? No, no it was not. Onward![break]</p>
<h2 id="round-1">Round 1</h2>
<p>Round 1 was Joe&#39;s choice of picture and he chose to do Mario; more particularly, he chose Tanookie statue Mario from Mario 3. A good, simple place to start, methought.</p>
<p>[gallery=Round 1 - Mario]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="The control picture."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]
In the end, we all came pretty close to the original.</p>
<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>
<p>Steve&#39;s picture choice for round 2 was Chiyo-chan in a cat outfit. A slight bump in difficulty that seemed thoroughly appropriate.</p>

<p>This was the only round where Joe did not finish his picture first (that would be me). I think everybody did well here, catching the cuteness of the original.</p>
<h2 id="final-round">Final Round</h2>
<p>The final round was a picture of my choosing and, in keeping with the increasing difficulty trend, I chose a picture with multiple characters in it. And hands. And clothing. It&#39;s a screen from the opening of Nichijou that I&#39;d planned on drawing at some point anyways.</p>
<p>[gallery=Final Round - The Nichijou Girls]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Control sample"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]</p>
<p>As can be inferred from the extra little scribblings on Joe and Steve&#39;s pages, they were not looking forward to this one as it was far more complex. Steve even gave up after drawing character number two. Still, they both are averaging a level of decency that rivals a lot of junk I see on deviantArt, so there&#39;s that.</p>
<p>In the end, Chris was the neutral party that judged all my art the best (not to brag, but I did have a ten year head start on them). However, if I do not keep my skills up they could easily surpass me. But, it&#39;s really not about winning or losing, it was just a fun time to be had and a good way to avoid packing....</p>
