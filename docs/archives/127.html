I'm thinking perhaps that an art section on the gallery page might be a good idea, but in the mean time you can enjoy it right here or on my [deviantArt page](http://dxprog.deviantart.com/). But, I digress.
[gallery=December 2009 Art]![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Midori_Kasugano.jpg "The colerized version of my Midori sketch from a few months back. My reference image was in black and white which left me to figure out the shading and such for this picture. That's why it looks like her hair is a lettuce leaf...")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Ryou_and_Nagisa.jpg "Ryou and Nagisa from the visual novel/anime CLANNAD. I suppose this could be considered bordering on yuri, in face my brother Jeff walked in as I was drawing and said "That's not platonic...". It is, of course, and who should know better than the artist? Subject matter aside, I consider this a large step up in terms of coloring and shading for me, trying out some new things.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nagisa_Winter.jpg "Nagisa again, this time from the After Story part of CLANNAD. I have to admit that I cheated a little on this one: I didn't sketch the line art myself. I instead traced a screen grab and did all the coloring (I wanted this as a desktop wallpaper). It actually was quite the learning experience as I'd not done coloring of this caliber before and I got a lot of things figured out. I hope to begin using these techniques for my own art in the near future.")[/gallery]
I hope everybody had a Merry Christmas and will have an awesome New Year!</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1">Two Years of Anime - Part 1</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 26, 2009</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Here begins three articles of anime reviews. Yes, I know I said two in the previous post, but after creating the list I realized it would be more prudent to split this into three. This also allows me to kind of categorize things and I&#39;ll kick the list off with cute and romantic comedies. Another thing to note is that my criteria have changed. The movies and video games were all things <em>released</em> in 2008-2009. These are all things I <em>watched</em> in those years. So, without further ado, here is part one of my anime reviews.</p>
<h2 id="midori-days">Midori Days</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_midori_days.jpg" alt="" title="Midori Days">
<em>Midori Days</em> falls into the latter of the aforementioned categories. The premise is absolutely rediculous opening with protagonist Sawamura Seiji waking up one day to find that a tiny girl, Kasugano Midori, has replaced his right hand. Oddly enough, even though the show indulges in more fan service than any other I&#39;ve watched, there was never a raunchy moment, something I thought odd considering the premise. The overall story follows these two as Midori tries to win over Seiji who is otherwise distracted by just about every other woman within eyesight... except the ones that actually like him. The show is full of plenty of laughs and feel good moments and I&#39;d certainly recommend watching it if you are interested in the genre. <strong>7/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="lucky-star">Lucky Star</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_lucky_star.jpg" alt="" title="Lucky Star">
One of my earlier forays into anime, Lucky Star is.... well, I&#39;m not entirely sure. Sure, it follows a group of high school girls, but that&#39;s about it. It follows these girls unusual conversations about various pop-culture, day-to-day things and Japanese culture references. Because of the Japan centric themes, I have a difficult time following being American. As the show goes on, these jokes and references become more mainstream, but the show itself is just random conversation. The only thing that really kept me watching was the cute artwork (I&#39;m secure enough in my manhood to admit that). <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="ichigo-mashimaro">Ichigo Mashimaro</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_ichigo_mashimaro.jpg" alt="" title="Ichigo Mashimaro">
<em>Ichigo Mashimaro</em>, or <em>Strawberry Marshmallow</em>, is in pretty much the same vein as <em>Lucky Star</em>, except drop the age of the girls to twelve and remove most of the pop-culture/Japan/etc references. What makes <em>Ichigo</em> better than <em>Lucky Star</em>, in my opinion, is that it&#39;s far more universal in its ramblings. For example, in the first episode, the girls all try to stay up late making a birthday gift for one of the girls&#39; sister. This is something I can relate to as my bros and I have done this before, only for our parents. It&#39;s a cute take on the slice-of-life genre and I certainly enjoyed watching it. Oh, and it has one of the best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzGbA1ov_WE">Engrish scenes</a> ever. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="karin">Karin</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_karin.jpg" alt="" title="Karin">
I do not like Vampires or anything Halloween related, even more so now that vampires are gay, angsty teenagers who sparkle in the sunlight. That said, the titular character of <em>Karin</em> is a vampire. Or rather, she&#39;s an un-vampire, injecting blood into her victims instead of the other way around. This is an interesting little romantic comedy that I didn&#39;t like initially but came to really enjoy. Througout its twenty-four episodes, it never really deviates too much from the main plot; that is, developing the relationship between Karin and her classmate Usui Kenta. The last couple of episodes are certainly intense and will leave you wondering what path the show will take. So, even with my general dislike for occultish things, <em>Karin</em> is worth a watch. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="bokusatsu-tenshi-dokuro-chan">Bokusatsu Tenshi - Dokuro-chan</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_bokusatsu_tenshi.jpg" alt="" title="Bokusatsu Tenshi - Dokuro-chan">
Remember when I said that I was convering cute things and romantic comedies? <em>Bokusatsu Tenshi</em> is neither of those. It&#39;s straight up, almost slapstick style comedy, something I&#39;d associate more with western cartoons. The basic premise of the story is that Dokuro, an angel from the future, has been sent to stop protagonist Sakura from creating a pedophile world; that is, a world in which all women stop aging at twelve. This only really comes into play in the first episode and everything else is just random situations. Oh, did I mention that Dokuro often kills Sakura in the most bloody and rediculous manner and then brings him back to life? There are a lot of really hilarious moments in this show and it saddens me that it only runs a handful of episodes. Perhaps that&#39;s for the best, though. <strong>7/10</strong>
So, there is the first wave of reviews. Next week I&#39;ll be covering more generic shounen stuff. What is week three you may ask? That, my friend, is a surprise.</p>

## Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008, Xbox 360)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_force_unleashed.jpg "Star Wars: The Force Unleashed")
There was quite a bit of hype surrounding this game when it came out. It was supposed to be a Star Wars IP that the world hadn't seen since _Shadows of the Empire_. Did it live up to the hype? Depends on who you ask. I didn't buy it until recently, but I definitely had fun playing it. That said, there were also many points where I was frustrated out of my mind to the point of controller throwing (something I've not done in years). Some of this was due to faulty game mechanics, but mostly my own incompetence. Sadly, the game is fairly repetitive in terms of combat and I found myself relying on Force lightning to handily finish off every enemy I came across. There are plenty of options for combat such as push and choke and, of course, your lightsaber, but none of these were as handy or wholly satisfying as lightning. Oh, and for all the hype about Euphoria, never once did I see a stormtrooper [grab another in mid air](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/2/1/). **7/10**[break]
## Animal Crossing: City Folk (2008, Wii)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_animal_crossing.jpg "Animal Crossing: City Folk")
The ever successful Animal Crossing franchise made its way onto the Wii last fall and... it's Animal Crossing. It keeps a lot of things from its DS pedecessor such as the rolling log world, but also brings back things sorely missed from the GameCube version such as separate houses for each player. The graphics have finally received a much needed bump, especially in the area of textures. The models, however, still remain fairly low-poly in some instances and the lighting isn't really helping anything in that department. Some things have been handled better than they were in the first game, such as moving some of the random occurances to permanent stores within the city. All in all, _City Folk_ just as fun and addictive as the original (110 hours of play doesn't lie), though I am slightly disappointed that it wasn't changed up more. **7/10**
## Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (2008, DS)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_apollo_justice.jpg "Apollo Justice")
After three highly successful (and truly amazing) Phoenix Wright games, Apollo Justice comes in to fill the shoes of the pointy-haired defense attorney that preceeded him. _Apollo Justice_ is the first _Ace Attoreny_ game designed specifically for the DS and they came up with some interesting ways to utilize the hardware. The cutscenes are fancier and the artwork is higher color, but it feels very much the same. The court scenes haven't really changed, though a new dynamic similar to Psyche-locks has been added. The stories are everythig you'd expect from the series making _Apollo Justice_ worthy of the _Ace Attorney_ title. **9/10**
## Resident Evil 5 (2009, Xbox 360)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_resident_evil_5.jpg "Resident Evil 5")
I've never played any of the _Resident Evil_ games before, but when a college buddy brought it over I played co-op with him. Surprisingly, it was a really fun game. The controls worked well and there were always plenty of zombies around to shoot. Granted, some areas kind of sucked balls, such as the boat trip through the swamp, collecting all the crystals in that temple/cave thing and, of course, the damned quick time events. But, those aside, it looked and played very nice and offered a couple days of gaming fun. **7/10**
## Mad World (2009, Wii)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_mad_world.jpg "Mad World")
I'll say this up front: paying $50 for this game without having played it first was a mistake. I was hooked by the uniqueness of the look and the idea that somebody was actually going to make something uniquely tailored to the Wii without being kiddie shovelware. It does look interesting, but upon close perusal, the graphics don't hold up. I didn't really know where the hell I was going half the time, and, while there are some unique ways to kill people, it was easier just to button mash. The interstitials with the pimp guy were kind of funny and John DiMaggio is always evntertaining, but there wasn't any content to keep me playing. With a whole two hours of play time, I wound up trading it in. **3/10**
## Scribblenauts (2009, DS)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_scribblenauts.jpg "Scribblenauts")
This is becoming a sad list of overhyped disappointments. Now don't get me wrong, under the surface of Scribblenauts lies an incredibly clever and inventive game. With a list of some 20,000+ objects you can call upon to complete various puzzles, there's a world of promise here. However, the execution was less than stellar. The objectives were generally vague, leaving me scratching my head as for what to do and when they weren't, I found myself solving most puzzles with a rope and helicoptor.The biggest offender, however, was the controls. The character and placement of items is all controlled via touchscreen and, if you are not very specific about where you click, you'll wind up careening to an untimely death. Honestly, the title screen for _Scribblenauts_ was probably the funnest part, being just a sandbox with which you can do whatever you want. I was so hopeful for this game and I hope that the developers take a step back, realize where they fucked up, and try it again. **4/10**
## Rhythm Heaven (2009, DS)
![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_rhythm_heaven.jpg "Rhythm Heaven")
It should be no secret at this point that I am a fan of rhythm games, but Rhythm Heaven is a unique and extremely fun take on the genre. There are dozens of mini-games based around two simple control guestures: touch and flick. It's so simple, yet you'll put in a crazy amount of hours if you want to get golds and perfects on each song. Speaking of which, this game has one of the funnest soundtracks I've heard in a while. Granted, not every one is a hit (espcially the localization of the sung tracks), but it'll always get your toes (and stylus) tapping. The art style and mini-games themselves are reminiscent of Wario Ware and is both fun and outlandish. There's plenty for everybody here and I'd definitely recommend picking up a copy if you own a DS. **10/10**
Of all these games, the Game of the Years award would hands down go to Rhythm Heaven. It's just so damned addictive and fun. Keep your eyes peeled as I'll wind up this series of reviews with a two parter covering all the anime I watched this year.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/two-years-of-video-game-reviews">Two Years of Video Game Reviews</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 24, 2009</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It is time now for the second wave of &#39;08/&#39;09 reviews with today&#39;s column covering video games.</p>
