<p>For a while there, back during my more public weeb years, I would round up some brothers and we&#39;d review anime at the end of a year. Having gone through old posts recent (as I do), I kind of missed that. It not only got my own thoughts out of my head, but gave me some insight into the thoughts of my bros. It was pretty neat.</p>
<p>That was five years ago...</p>
<p>Since then, I&#39;ve really toned down anime fanboyism beyond some collecting (which stays in my office) and watching a handful of shows per year. If you only see two or three shows in a year, that doesn&#39;t make for much of a pool with which to write a wrap up. If you do that for several years, however, then you&#39;ve got something to write about. Also, you learn that your little sisters are now suddenly self-labeled otaku and the idea of doing that little writing exercise sounds like fun again.</p>
<p>That leads to the end of this intro and the beginning of Five Years of Backlog Anime Reviews, All in the Family Edition! I myself will be picking only shows from 2014-2018, but considering everybody has been playing catch up, no such restrictions there. Also, given the number of participants this time &#39;round, only one category per day.</p>
<p>Best OP</p>
<p>The Five Methods of Obtaining Happiness That I&#39;m Aware Of - Gourmet Girl Graffiti</p>
<p>I had a hell of a time with this. First, I couldn&#39;t remember any OPs from the last five years off the top of my head, even as I scrolled down the list of shows I viewed. Then, of the three I actually remembered, I couldn&#39;t whittle it down to one. One Punch Man&#39;s &quot;THE HERO!!&quot; has musical hooks coming out the ass, but the opening animation wasn&#39;t quite as great as I remembered. A similar story for Death Parade&#39;s &quot;Flyers&quot;; an awesome toe tapper of a song with some interesting visual sequences. In the end, though, I have to give it to &quot;The Five Methods of Obtaining Happiness That I&#39;m Aware Of&quot; from the bizarre food show, Gourmet Girl Graffiti. Not only have I listened to the shit out of that song (some 200+ times), but the actual animation is a charming little narrative all its own. It follows the protagonists through an Alice in Wonderland themed food adventure, accentuating the song which has notes (pun intended) of curiosity and adventure. Unlike my runner ups, it actually doesn&#39;t resort to lazy panning shots or stils, either, ultimately gaving it the edge to win.</p>
<p>Best ED</p>
<p>Chiisana Boukensha - Konosuba</p>
<p>Unlike my search for an OP, there are plenty of EDs in the 2014-2018 time range that are awesome. I prefer EDs in general because they tend to be more diverse in their sound... or maybe they&#39;re usually just slower and I like slow songs. Just like the song I&#39;ve chosen as my favorite! I&#39;ve described Konosuba as the anime version of Always Sunny. It&#39;s zany, it&#39;s irreverent, and it&#39;s damned hilarious. So, it&#39;s a pretty cool change of pace that the closing song is a slow folksy affair set over tilt shift photography of the town in which the characters live. It&#39;s cathartic just seeing the world be normal in an old timey kind of way after twenty minutes of craziness.</p>
<p>Best Character</p>
<p>Kazuma, Aqua, Megimun, Darkness - Konosuba</p>
<p>So, there&#39;s definitely some cheating going on here, because I&#39;ve selected four characters as my single best. But, hear me out.
Worst Character</p>
