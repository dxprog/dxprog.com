<p>Well we have survived. No Y2K bug anywhere. Tonight we&#39;re going to swimming. Stevie is playing computer.</p>
<p>What a great Christmas I had. got alot of neat stuff. Here&#39;s a list so you don&#39;t forget.</p>
<ol>
<li>Portable CD Player - Mom &amp; Dad</li>
<li>Cards and a card game book - M &amp; D</li>
<li>Episode I Racer - Mom &amp; Dad</li>
<li>A Great Joystick - Mom &amp; Dad</li>

</ol>
<p>I&#39;m now e-mailing Chassidy &amp; Casey. Also Dave &amp; Dan. Jeff hasn&#39;t gotten anything back from Anthony. I haven&#39;t gotten anything back from Leah or John. I sent Christmas cards to all of my pen-pals. Well gotta run. Bye.[/quote]</p>
<p>I cannot disagree; that was a pretty awesome Christmas. Episode I Racer I particularly have very fond memories of. Also, that joystick was the best I&#39;ve ever used (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963168-0403-WingMan-Joystick/dp/B00000JCSB">a weighted Logitech Wingman, ftr</a>). Additionally, in the time between this and the previous post, our family procured our first (modern) computer. I can still rattle off the specs:</p>
<p>Dell XPS-T450 (service tag 72y1a)</p>
<ul>
<li>450Mhz Pentium III</li>
<li>128MB RAM</li>
<li>Voodoo 3 3000 w/ 16MB VRAM</li>
<li>Turtle Beach Montego II (sound)</li>
<li>13GB HDD</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have the original mobo/cpu in my closet. Ah, good times. Good times...</p>

There should be no reason for this, especially since the content is already written and all I have to do is transcribe them. However, these two aren&#39;t quite as happy go lucky (and the entry that occurred between them was even less than happy, but at some point was lost to the annals of time). I have no comment on these, so will just present them.</p>

Hi! It&#39;s been awhile since I last wrote. I got another letter from Leah. I sent one to John again. I&#39;m hoping to get a letter from him this week. [two statements redacted for personal reasons] Also the Birthright garage sale is on Friday and Mom is going to get me some art pencils. Joey is scooting around now. He is really big. Grandpa is in the hospital. It doesn&#39;t look good either. Dave came up. It was nice to visit with him. DFad is going to let me send and recieve e-mails via his address. I can&#39;t get my own because I was on QB chat. Speaking of QBasic I&#39;m making a new game. It&#39;s called Mario Mash. I&#39;m just about finished. All I need to add is sound and music. My fish is still around. He also knows a trick. When I feed him I flip the food down off the shelf and he goes crazy. We&#39;re almost finished our first month of school. It&#39;s kinda easy except for English. I&#39;m learning about the French-Indian War. It&#39;s really neat. Well gotta go. Bye![/quote]</p>

The day after the last entry grandpa died. The funeral has been and everyone came up. I got to meet mom&#39;s bro Mike. We got a macintosh. It&#39;s lots of fun. I&#39;m keeping a second journal on it. I finished my Mario game. It&#39;s better then Plane Attack. Now I&#39;m going to make Rebel Attack. I have everything figured out. I got a letter from John today. I already have a letter ready to go. Well my hand is tiered so I&#39;ll wrap it up here. I forgot a few things. I got some art pencils. [statement redacted] [Mom and Dad are] talking about getting a computer right now.[/quote]</p>
<p>I will say that it&#39;s hard to believe that my grandpa has been dead for nearly half my life. Wish I could play one last round of checkers with him...</p>
