Whooo!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 23, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It seems my comic has finally gained a little bit of recognition. That&#39;s right, I was featured on this week&#39;s <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/22/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-16-22-2006">webcomic pick of the week</a> poll on <a href="http://www.joystiq.com">Joystiq</a>. Not only that, however, but people actually commented on it (see comments 11-13, 12 is my favorite). Now, I can&#39;t brag too much because Chris has been on <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/10/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-june-4-10-2006/">there</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/15/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-9-15-2006/">twice</a>. Still, it&#39;s a pretty awesome feeling to be noticed on one of the internet&#39;s biggest game news sites. Anyhoo, since I&#39;ll be having guests I&#39;ve gone through all the trouble of pulling together the RSS feed for the comic (use the icon above, or IE7&#39;s handy little dropdown box).</p>

<p>Alright, first off the name&#39;s changed from F5 to Digital Double. Why? Well, I believe that more accurately reflects the intent of the strip as it&#39;s supposed to loosely be based off my life (my digital double). So that&#39;s that.</p>
<p>As for the comic itself, that stemmed from a <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/headlines/H_3155/35.shtml#headline">crack</a> induced conversation I had with devusb last week. This happens quite often. It&#39;s kind of scary...</p>

So, here it is! Everything is as it should be; my laptop is back, my blog is running on my own design again, uhhh.... other stuff... yeah. So, anyways, enjoy :-)</p>

<p>Anyways, I have good news! And, no, I didn&#39;t save a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico. No, it seems that my laptop has FINALLY been repaired (going on over a month now, I believe). From the repair center: &quot;repaired- replaced fl inverter, fixed latch,and cleaned heatsink,very&quot;. It seems I got everything I asked for and thensome, though the  heatsink was very what? Very big? Very sexy? Very... whatever?! I dunno.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I finally managed to snag that which I have been seeking my entire life. The very purpose of man&#39;s existance. The driving force of all creatures... a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44121975@N00/191885027/">Super Nintendo Entertainment System!!</a> (in box, even). Of course, no SNES is complete without the greatest game ever made... FINAL FANTASY VI!!! Ah, the sweet, sweet days of care free gaming, when all was right in the world.... it&#39;s a pity those days are gone.</p>
<p>Ah, well. I shall be off with sweet dreams of snes&#39;s and laptops in my head :-)</p>
