<p>So, recently, my bros have had a couple accounts hacked (one email, one Steam). Fearing that I was next in line, I started changing all my passwords using the scheme laid out above: very long passwords consisting of easy to remember normal words/phrases.</p>
<p>First, I changed my facebook password. It complained that my password was &quot;weak&quot;, but allowed me to proceed.</p>
<p>Twitter was all &quot;dude, that password is very secure&quot; and I&#39;m like &quot;hells, yes. They get it.&quot;</p>
<p>My bank limited me to 14 characters, so I said fuck it as that&#39;s the only place I use that password and my user name and banking institution would need to be known. Also, they lock my account after three failed login attempts at which point I must call. Whatever, we&#39;ll let that one slide.</p>
<p>And then we come to Skype. Now, Skype is the only program that didn&#39;t get a password change after my too-commonly used password was leaked (in md5 hash form) from one of the lulz sec releases in the spring. (Why I didn&#39;t change it, I don&#39;t know). I figured now may was well be that time.</p>
<p>So, I entered <em>skypeissomehowmuchbetterthanvoip</em> into both boxes and it gave me the green check mark of &quot;you&#39;re good&quot;. Click the submit button. </p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_length.png" alt="" title="Longer is better!"></p>
<p>Okay, I disapprove, but whatever. I&#39;ll roll with it.</p>
<p><em>skypeiskindastupid</em></p>
<p>18 characters, close enough. Green check mark, submit.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_number.png" alt="" title="Really?"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p><em>fuckyouskypefucky00</em> (hard to tell with Georgia, but those are zeroes on the end)</p>
<p>19 characters, with numbers, plenty long and certainly memorable. Again, green check, submit.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_complexity.png" alt="" title="WTF?"></p>
<p>So, let me get this straight. My old, six character, one number, one caps password is just fine and dandy, but a long string which (yes, contains words, repeating even) isn&#39;t? Really?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#39;m a trifle pissed. And as I write this, I <em><strong>still</strong></em> haven&#39;t changed that password. And I&#39;m going to email this to Skype and tell them exactly what I think of this bullshit.</p>
<p>Okay, soapbox done.</p>

The last time I talked about features was v3 and I&#39;m now two versions up from that. In today&#39;s post, I&#39;ll highlight version 4.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/dxmpv4.jpg"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/dxmpv4.jpg" alt="" title="More like a sandbox than a polished product">Click for larger view...</a></p>
<p>As you can see, v4 was hardly polished. It fell victim to the &quot;I want to add new features but I don&#39;t want to design for it&quot; that v3 had towards the end of it&#39;s life (hint: it&#39;s the row of links towards the top). v4 was the first to go three column, based loosely off of what Microsoft was doing with the Zune player. The first column was for albums, second for whatever-the-fuck-I-wanted (songs, trending and latest in this case), and the third was the current playlist.</p>
<p>Also introduced in this version was a new extensible player module. I had tacked HTML5 capabilities onto v3 down at the end of its life, but this was the first to be built with that in mind. Also, it was the first to be able to switch output sources (here&#39;s where the modular part comes in) from HTML5 to remotely controlled VLC, which would play music out of the server itself. This could be done on the fly without having to use a separate page entirely, as had been done.</p>
<p>Finally, I had made a few things that would aid in the finding of media. Based upon recorded play data, you could get a list of media that was trending in the last seven days. Also added was a search-as-you-type function to quickly locate songs.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes there&#39;s a &quot;video&quot; tab there, but it never did anything. I had grandiose plans to merge my separate &quot;video page&quot; into this, but they never panned out.</p>
<p>Ultimately, v4 was just a testing ground for a lot of ideas that all got packaged up neatly in v5...</p>

I didn&#39;t think I could do it, but it turned out to be not so difficult. Yay me! Now that that&#39;s out of the way, let me weave you a tale.</p>
<p>Four days a week, I eat Hot Pockets(R) for lunch (the fifth is usually Subway). I have a very specific routine:</p>
<p>1) Walk to break room
2) Grab Hot Pocket(R) and set microwave for 2 minutes
3) Leave break room and take a leak
4) Return to break room and retrieve Hot Pocket(R)</p>
<p>Mundane, yes? Nothing special happening here, right? That&#39;s where you&#39;d be wrong. By the time I return to the break room from the the bathroom, the microwave will read, WITHOUT FAIL, between 18 and 22 seconds left.</p>
<p>This routine, with all the variables (how fast I walk, how much I need to piss, people I might bump into along the way, etc), takes 1 minute and 40 seconds with an error rate of -2/+2 seconds. That&#39;s pretty damn good if you ask me.</p>

<p>After some four months of various levels of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/procrastinatorium/">procrastination</a>, I finally finished that picture some deviantArt guy requested. I will never do another one of these doll things again.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/art-battle-redux">Art Battle Redux!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 23, 2011</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>A few months back, my two youngest bros and myself had a little <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/art-battle-fighting-small-children-for-my-ego/">art battle</a> which I summarily won quite handily. This weekend, as I was visiting my folks, we held another one. Same premise: each person chooses a picture, all three must draw said picture to the best of their ability. All laying around my iPad, the battle began.</p>
<p>[gallery=Joe&#39;s Pick - Wind Waker Link]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_link.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_link.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_link.jpg" alt="" title="Link">Steve&#39;s Version[/img]
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_link.jpg" alt="" title="Link">My Version[/img][/gallery]
I would&#39;ve figured Joe would have this in the bag as he draws Wind Waker Link A LOT and without reference, even. But, such was not to be. As can be seen, I got a little bored waiting for everybody to finish.</p>
<p>[gallery=Steve&#39;s Pick - L from Death Note]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_l.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_l.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_l.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_l.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Now, I will go on record and say I didn&#39;t like the chosen picture much, but there it is. I&#39;d actually call this a three way tie because we all hit and miss aspects of the picture (there&#39;s something going on with the eyes on mine).</p>
<p>[gallery=Matt&#39;s Pick - Haqua from World God Only Knows]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Joe decided to sit this one out for whatever reason pretty much leaving me the winner by default. Both Steve and I quit prematurely because we were getting bored with the whole thing. I&#39;m just happy mine doesn&#39;t look &quot;lumpy&quot; and even Chris agreed.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Our second art battle with me, yet again, taking away the trophy. I think next time we should try not copying a source image and just toss out a subject to draw. It could very well level the playing field. All in good fun, though.</p>
