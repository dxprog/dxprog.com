I suppose I can just ramble.</p>
<p>My Wal-Mart experiences of late have not been of the highest caliber. Granted, one doesn&#39;t usually expect world class service at the World of Walls, but this has been exceedingly blah. Cashiers who just don&#39;t give a shit, seem to be high out of their mind or cannot comprehend the English language are what greet me at my new Wal-Mart. Though, I just left my old one, full of good people whom I mostly know, after having gotten the worst cashier yet.</p>
<p>I was there to pick up the new Weird Al album (which was not in the new releases as it should have been) and made a bee line to express lane with the shortest queue. The cashier, some teenager named Jace, was trying to open his drawer, an action that locks up the register until a CSM has approved it from their keypad. Problem number one - you don&#39;t lock up your register when there are customers waiting and you don&#39;t have to. He then proceeded to get exceedingly pissed off, swearing and smashing the clear button on his keyboard. He was honestly becoming quite violent.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand his frustration with slow CSM response and the slowness to back out of an action on the aging registers. I&#39;ve been on both sides of of that equation. However, he did unessecarily bring it upon himself and his display of frustration was absolutely not professional.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I guess this post became a rant about my Wal-Mart experience, but it still counts.</p>

Today, I am going to pass on my tried and true formula to you, my adoring Internet audience.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step1.jpg" alt="" title="The human slice-n-dice, I am">
Chop some onion, celery and carrots. This is known in the culinary world as <em>mirepoix</em>.</p>
<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step2.jpg" alt="" title="Much sizzling happens here">
Saute your <em>mirepoix</em> in some olive oil along with spices and other things.</p>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step3.jpg" alt="" title="MAGIC!">
Apply a healthy dose of magic. This step is critical and you mustn&#39;t get it wrong lest you create a hideous food beast.</p>
<h2 id="step-4">Step 4</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step4.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s good enough to each, which is good. It is food, after all.">
Enjoy over some thin spaghetti. Not that fat stuff. Ideally, you&#39;d also have Parmesan cheese, though I sadly did not for this instance.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now can make your own BFSS to woo over whomever you please!</p>

This got me to realizing that I&#39;ve coded this particular game to some varying level to completion five times now, six if you include the yet to be written iPad version.</p>
<p>Six times. And now you&#39;ll get the code for a good many of those.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h2>

My first shot for a TAttack clone didn&#39;t make it too far. It was little more of a see-if-I-could attempt. Written in Visual Basic and using GDI for graphics, there&#39;s not much to see here except how terrible it is.[break]</p>

The second version was the one for that VB game contest <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/">all those years ago</a> and arguably the most complete version to date. It had a menu, full sound, character scripting, particle effects and who knows what else. I am quite prideful in that this is a very frame accurate clone of the original game. Actually, this is probably my most complete anything to date...</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have some guy from the now defunct tetrisattack.net forums provide some graphics in an age where I sucked at such things. Of course, some of them were taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanon">Kanon</a> which I find ironic because I did not know what it was at the time and probably despised it. Now I&#39;ve watched and own the series and have started an attempt to bring it to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots/">your browser</a>...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/field.png" alt="" title="Shiori had me pegged all those years ago..."></p>
<p>This too was written in VB6 (of course), but I used DirectX 8 for all the multimedia handlings. Sadly, starting with Windows Vista, all support for the DXVB libraries has been dropped and it does not work. Thanks a lot, Microsoft.</p>
<h2 id="gameboy-advance-attempt">Gameboy Advance Attempt</h2>
<p>Download: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/tetrisattack.gba">ROM</a>
At one point or another, I decided to learn myself some Gameboy Advance programming. Why not start off with a game that was wholly familiar to me by this point? Sadly, I&#39;ve since lost the original source to the annals of time, but the rom still exists so there is that.</p>

My latest shot at creating this game is actually not my first using the XNA library, though it is my most complete of the two. The first XNA version was actually for the Xbox 360 shortly after I got my student, 1-year dev pass (or whatever you want to call it). There were thoughts of that this time around as well, but all has been shelved due to the whole iPad idea. I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea of making it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_project">Touhou</a> themed to get a little extra press amoungst the nerdcore. They&#39;re loose enough with their IP that I could totally do that. Ultimately, whether or not I head this direction is still undecided. And I still need to figure out how to get an Airplay SDK project set up in VS...</p>
