I was, at one point, going to film several little skits or vignettes about the untimely demise of Peeps, but really only finished one. However, for the first time ever, you can see the unfinished, unreleased opening!</p>

Fun fact: the fat kid in the commercial - my brother Chris - is very not fat now.</p>

Using a sewing machine kindly borrowed from my sisters, I laid down the first stitches to that end today.</p>
<p>I spent the first thirty minutes battling the contraption before I decided to just google the damn thing. I eventually stumbled upon some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEvMTv2xVg">scrap book sewing how to video</a> that happened to be using mostly the same model of machine I had (same machine, different paint job).</p>

<p>After watching all twentyish minutes of tutorial, I was finally up and running and created a successful debug output piece.</p>

<p>With all the pre-work out of the way, I got started on one of the pieces. It turned out pretty shitty and I&#39;ve got nine more to go...</p>

Because I&#39;m lazy that way.</p>

As such, I have made use of it quite a bit in my one month of living here. I thought, perhaps, I could give some quick thoughts on the movies I have watched there.</p>
<h2 id="thor">Thor</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_thor.jpg" alt="" title="Thor">
I know pretty much nothing about the Marvel universe (outside of what I&#39;ve seen in movies), so I went into Thor with no idea of what to expect. It has a much different tone than previous Marvel movies, a feeling I attribute to the source material being more based on Norse mythos as opposed to straight up sci-fi. It was an enjoyable film, but not near as awesome as the first Iron Man. - 7/10
