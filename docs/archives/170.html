<p>Speaking of my work, be sure to check out the brand new portfolio section. It\&#39;s a little sparse now, but I will be filling it out with all my best work over the next few days. I encourage you to re-check out my motion graphics projects there as they are encoded in much higher quality than the YouTube versions (and it\&#39;s the only place you\&#39;ll be able to see the corrected <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/gallery/3">Crayola Commercial</a>) . Also, you get to use my snazzy new video player (written entirely in Flex).</p>
<p>Of course, the blog got a couple needed updates as well. Down at the bottom of the page you\&#39;ll notice page navigation. This is across the board for general viewing, viewing tags, and the archives. Another thing to get the page treatment was the entry comments. There\&#39;s only really <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows/">one entry</a> that can benefit from this update right now, but I hope to gain some more viewers by shifting my posts more towards industry related topics and some tutorials. Originally I was going to intersperse tweets between the posts but decided ultimately against it.</p>
<p>So, there it is. The site looks more awesome than ever and I\&#39;m hoping to bring some new sweet, juicy content to everybody. So, bookmark the site or add the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/dxprog">feed</a> to your favorite RSS reader and prepare for a new era of dxprog!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>From the Orlando Anime Festival</h2><time>August 16, 2008</time><div><p>Yesterday, we (Ryan, Tyler, and I) had the pleasure of finally attending my very first convention (outside of the local county fair). Sadly, it wasn&#39;t a sci-fi convention as I would have liked, but an anime convention. I don&#39;t consider myself to be an anime nerd, and even border on disliking the genre entirely, but I did have a pretty good time none the less. The convention itself was fairly small in comparison to others, but there was still a goodly amount of things going on and plenty of dealers peddling their anime related wares.</p>
<p>The atmosphere or the con was... nerdy. Even so, I felt strangely out of place as I was one of the few attendees that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> cosplaying. Most of the costumes I didn&#39;t recognize, but there were the likes of Phoenix Wright, Yuna, Link and, surprisingly, several Snakes from Metal Gear:

It still surprised me just how many girls were there. In fact, I&#39;d say the males were outnumbered by quite a bit which, for me, is an unusual situation to be in seeing as I go to school overflowing with testosterone. Just being around all these people was probably the most entertaining part of the day.</p>
<p>One of the areas we spent the most time in was the dealers floor. Just about anything anime related was being sold. Mangas, DVDs, T-shirts, action figures, plushies, costumes, weapons. And that&#39;s barely scratching the surface. As you can see in the picture above, I broke down and bought a Godot shirt. I wubs it!</p>
<p>There were some video games, including an NES championship tournament, but it was a side to everything else going on. There were rooms showing animes, people talking about how to improve your AMV/drawings, all sorts of crazy stuff. We wound up the night by sitting in on the &quot;Weakest Geek&quot; game show. It was kind of like Double Dare (sans the mess) and a quiz show with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire music playing in the background the entire time. The biggest part of this game was the &quot;Box&quot; game wherein a picture of an action figure would be shown and the player would then proceed to try to find said action figure in a fish tank filled with <em>more</em> action figures and packing peanuts. It was all rather entertaining to watch and the crew running the show was pretty cool.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to wrap this post up with a video I took while I was there (and later added music to).
