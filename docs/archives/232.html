The new Nintendo Revolution controller was finally unveiled. At first I was kind of skeptical, I mean the thing is a freakin' remote:

Part of me kind of died because I've grown up holding a controller in two hands using super quick thumb reflexes to get myself around. However, the more I thought about the possibilities of the tilt sensors, the more I began to like it. One thing that I would love to see is a Star Wars lightsaber game. I was still kind of leery, but then I heard that there's a conventional controller that you can plug the remote into. Besides, I'll be able to play Tetris Attack, so I have to buy one whether I like the controller or note. Needless to say I really can't wait to get my hands on one of these and see how it works.

On the house front: A good 75-80% of the house is packed now. Mainly just the big things (furniture, appliances, computers, etc.) are left. Sometime tomorrow we'll be getting a dumpster and emptying the garage and packing the U-Haul. It's going to be a long, tiring week but it'll be well worth it.

As an interesting closer I post some things I've unearthed (either through packing or cleaning up my computer):

So, here they are:

I seem to be missing pictures of the master bedroom as well as Steve and Joe's room, but that's the gist of it. 

Most of our stuff (and when I say our I'm usually refferring to Jeff, Chris and myself since we are roomies) is all packed and ready to go.

Well, we're getting down to the wire on this but it looks like we're gonna make it! Part of me is kind of sad that we're going to leave this house (I mean, I've lived here 18 out of 19 years of my life), but it'll be nice to move on.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/pictures-yay">Pictures!

Yesterday was the first night of bowling and a good night of bowling it was. The first two games were sort of ehhhh, but the last game was my best yet. I'll let the image speak for itself (haven't tested this Tetra feature, so it's overdue ;-)):

Yeah, 207! My dad was only 18 ahead of me at 225 (I beat him the first game :-D). If this had been last year I would've gotten my 100 pins over average watch. Pooh :-P. 

Well, with the moving and all, it may be a while until I can put anything up. I'll try to squeak out a little blurb before I have to pack my computer. Cheers :-)</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/the-moving-begins">The moving begins!</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 14, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Our realtor called today and apparently we should&#39;ve been packing a week ago because now we&#39;re left with exactly one week to pack!
