Or maybe even six years?</a></h1><time class="post__published">February 5, 2018</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Hmmm... the dust is thick... about one year thick. How did that happen?</p>
<p>2017 was not a great year. I&#39;m sure many others would say the same for various purposes and reasons, but mine are my own. I&#39;d argue that it was probably one of my most depressed years on record. Nothing seemed to click, outside of drinking and wallowing in similar misery with friends. There&#39;s <em>some</em> hyperbole in there; there were some reasonable moments of 2017, but it had the lowest lows, I think.</p>
<p>But we&#39;re not here to talk about depression. That&#39;s a post (or more) all its own.</p>
<p>Can you believe it&#39;s been <em>six years</em> since I last redesigned this blog? Indeed, for a sequence of time, <a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/this-site-of-yore/">redesigns were nearly annual</a>. I&#39;ve no doubt that part of the cool off was simply my entrance into web developent as a profession. I&#39;ve exactly one redesign since beginning my employ at the end 2009. No doubt running <a href="https://redditbooru.com">RedditBooru</a> and <a href="https://animebracket.com">AnimeBracket</a> on the side has contributed to the slacking as well. Who wants to rewrite a blog when you&#39;ve got two successful websites that demand attention?</p>
<p>But, six years man... that&#39;s a long time.</p>
<p>This redesign comes at a time where minimalism is at the forefront of design. Gone are the days of small text, gaudy colors, and rounded corners. In is simple to read typography and spatially considerate layouts. Makes it easier to style a website, for sure. But, I also went waaaaaaay back to basics on the site engine itself. Instead of the behemoth do-everything-and-framwork-for-the-rest CMS, this site is static. You won&#39;t find comments. You won&#39;t find metrics driver &quot;popular content&quot;. There is simply... content. And it&#39;s all created by me.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;ve not gone back to the days of hand authoring HTML files. I&#39;m better than that. This iteration of dxprog.com is powered by a static site generator that I wrote, because I&#39;ve not made one of those. The content is all markdown files and the layout is put together with React components. Initially, it was going to be a bunch of handlebars templates, but the notion of using nothing but a bunch of shareable React components to statically stitch a page together intrigued me. Seems to have worked, because here we are. My intention for the site generator itself was to be both standalone and also extensible via an npm package. This site is built the latter way. But, enough technical shit.</p>
<p>When will the next redesign be? Who knows. Six years from now, I&#39;ll be pushing forty.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a scary thought...</p>

I&#39;ll try to keep the words to a minimum and let the pictures talk (zoom into the picture for recipe type shits).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j1btAYe.jpg" alt="" title="Once that water&#39;s boiling, add the soba. I like to swish it around for the first 15-30 seconds with chopsticks. Then, allow to boil for five minutes."></p>

<p>Chris and I had cold soba while in Sendai this year, though I&#39;m pretty sure the broth was nothing like this. To be honest, I haven&#39;t yet bothered to look up a recipe, but this sauce has worked pretty universally with various Japanese types of cuisine.</p>
<p>Authentic? Probably not.</p>
<p>Delicious?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>

The one thing I hadn&#39;t tried was the ever popular &quot;blow on the cartridge&quot; trick. It was the one thing that worked. I then proceeded to make a whole video of me playing it in the glitched up state...</p>

I don&#39;t regret my choice. It was a sweet movie with crazy effects and magic and some good old Marvel humor.</p>
<p>That said, it&#39;s now a bit late and I want a quick way out. So, here&#39;s a before and after photo of one of my recent broken NES aquisitions.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kW0U3hu.jpg" alt="" title="If you look closely, you can see a wire near the top right corner."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3Z3i8qw.jpg" alt="" title="SUCH A SHINY WITH THAT BLURRY DEPTH OF FIELD"></p>
<p>I have both of these machines, but the one on the right is the one in the after picture. The internals of the thing were fine, for the most part. The connector was shoddy as hell, though, so I refurb&#39;d the pins with a dental pick. After a little soak in the tub and a little scrubbing, it now plays games fabulously and <em>looks</em> fabulous too.</p>
<p>The one on the left has board issues of some sort, so when it does play at all, the graphics are all crazy go nuts. I wanted to grab a picture of Mario 3, but couldn&#39;t get the game to boot.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.</p>
