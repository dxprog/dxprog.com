<p>I don&#39;t think this one came out quite as well. Stupid arms and poses and stuff.</p>

It&#39;s a little shorter today as we were all down with the sickness at various points last week, but rest assured more is to come.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_punie.jpg" alt="" title="Dai Mahou Togue">
The story revolves around a young girl named Tanaka Punie who is princess of Magical Land. In order for her to become queen, however, she must become a transfer student in a Japanese high school. Crazy hi-jinks ensue.</p>

Unfortunately, while this show has plenty of crazy moments, nothing ever really lived up to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4i-F0gwwzs&amp;feature=related">clip that inspired me to watch it.</a> The show itself is a successor of sorts to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">Bokusatsu Tenshi</a>, but never comes close in terms of production or entertainment value. It feels like it&#39;s trying to do the same type of thing, but just doesn&#39;t have the good writing and characters that Bokusatsu Tenshi does. - <strong>5/10</strong></p>

I have even less to say about this. <strong>7/10</strong></p>

Wow, this show is weird.  It shows an anthropomorphic potato peeling itself, which is a testament to just how weird it is.  Unfortunately, this weirdness isn&#39;t enough to make the four episode series very funny.
The first episode is great, maintaining its comic energy throughout, but once the second episode comes around it&#39;s already losing momentum.  That&#39;s not to say that the final three episodes are bad, because they do contain some genuinely funny moments, but between those moments of win it rarely becomes more than mild entertainment.
For a short series though, you could do worse. <strong>6/10</strong></p>

The Chinese zodiac says that this year is the year of the rabbit. Finally, reason for me to stuff a picture of Haruhi and cast sporting bunny outfits at the top of a post. But, this isn&#39;t what I&#39;m here to discuss.</p>
<p>It is indeed a new year and with new years come waves and waves of resolutions. In years prior, I openly shunned the idea of making new years resolutions. Why wait for some celestial anomoly to make changes to yourself as a person? While I still hold to this belief, I now view the changing of the calendar as a time to reflect upon/mark milestones within one&#39;s life. That said, here is my list of things I would like to accomplish in 2011.

Anybody who has perused this blog for more than five minutes is acutely aware of this. One thing I did in August &#39;09 was to add play stat tracking in so I could see what had been listened to when. Now that this functionality has been in for a full calendar, I&#39;ve culled all the data to present a bunch of pure CSS graphs filled with 2010&#39;s listening habits.</p>

Any kind of original documentation that resided on Lik-sang where I oriinally released MPSS is now gone (thanks, Sony) so, I&#39;m here to provide a real tutorial as there seems to be interest for the old skinner that I didn&#39;t realize still existed. So, here is the official MP Skin Studio tutorial, brought to you by dxprog. I&#39;ll go through the entire process making a real skin as I go.
