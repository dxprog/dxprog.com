<p>Somehow, I managed to not <em>die of boredom</em> from my overnight stay at San Francisco yesterday. Interestingly enough, I wasn&#39;t the only person with the genius idea to camp out. As I wandered through out the airport trying to make myself tired enough to be able to sleep anywhere, I saw a lot of people sleeping anywhere. Particularly, restaurant booths were very popular.</p>
<p>But, that all aside, we endured the 11 hour flight and are now in the land that provides me with my primary sources of entertainment, both in television and games. The flight itself was alright, with plenty of entertainment options and a fair amount of food, none of which was terrible.</p>
<p>Being in Japan feels both surreal and almost... normal. Obviously, despite cultural differences, Japan is just another first world country and, as such, has many of the same conventions as our Western world. Combined with the fact that we&#39;re just kind of nestled into their civilization instead of segregated out as part of a tour group or something, it almost just feels like we&#39;re integrating in, as it were.</p>
<p>Except we&#39;re very, very not Asian and everybody around us is. And I have no idea what to do in some situations, due to language barrier and intrinsic Japanese mannerisms. But, all should be good in Akihabara tomorrow, the otaku capital of the world. I expect to lose quite a lot of money...</p>
<p>Before I go on to pictures, I just want to tell a small story that amused me to no end. As we were checking into our hotel, the lady behind the counter was explaining various this: where the bathrooms and showers were, how to get in the back door if we came in after hours, but notably checking out. &quot;You must check out before 10am and to do that, just put your key in the cat box.&quot; as she pointed to a simple wooden box with a porcelain cat on it. I don&#39;t know why, but it tickled me. I think it was part her earnest delivery coupled with her accent and just... it was called the &quot;cat box&quot;. It was insanely cute.</p>
<p>But now, some pictures:</p>

<p>Our hotel room is really, really small. Basically, it&#39;s large enough for the two bunk beds and the TV in between. But, it&#39;s a bed and quite conveniently located to other stuff, so I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all for this update, stay tuned for more.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Curse of Punctuality</h2><time>May 31, 2013</time><div><p>I am currently sitting in the airport, sulking in a chair across from the very open and lively airline counter with which I would check in my stuff. Through this line I passed and was at the counter rejected because I was trying to check in too early. My flight doesn&#39;t leave for another nine hours, but I like to be early.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always liked to be early.</p>
<p>When I worked at Walmart, if I wasn&#39;t there fifteen minutes before my scheduled clock-in time, I felt late. For any class, appointment, or interview, if I wasn&#39;t fifteen to twenty minutes early, I felt late. Perhaps it&#39;s less that I feel like I was late when I arrived, but I always aimed to hit these early times.</p>
<p>Because you never know what could happen in between.</p>
<p>For example, say you&#39;re commuting to work from 40 miles away. There&#39;s a whole hell of a lot that can happen in between. Weather, car accidents, or perhaps a horny giraffe has died of high blood pressure and is now blocking several lanes of traffic. That extra time works as a great buffer for these kinds of occasions so you can still be, at the very least, on time. If there are no issues, then you&#39;re early and get credit for being punctual.</p>
<p>And certainly, the bullet point on one&#39;s reputation for punctuality is part of the issue at stake. It&#39;s an easy thing to attain on the ever looming &quot;annual review&quot;. A high mark there gives one yet more buffer room on something else - small lapses in product quality, perhaps...</p>
<p>But, outside of that (and more importantly as I realized on the train), it reduces doubt. I am here, planning a sleep over at the airport, because I don&#39;t want anything left to chance on this very big trip of mine. I get as much work done on my projects as soon as I can to make room for the things that got glossed over, the challenges that weren&#39;t foreseen, and any scope creep that may and will occur. I aim to do everything in my power so that if something goes wrong, I did everything I possibly could to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like insurance you get just for being a litte bit impatient, a little bit paranoid, and a little bit proactive.</p>
<p>Well, that killed, like... fifteen minutes...</p>
