<p>Today I got a basic graphics stack implemented and working, though it&#39;s riddled with its fair share of bugs and is certainly nowhere near being feature complete (environmental objects, animation, etc). However, I&#39;m having no problem running through entire scenario files having completed the first day in Kanon with no problems. But, on to the screenshots (note - the following where all taken in Chrome 12.0.712.0 dev)!</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss3.jpg" alt="" title="An astute observation."></p>
<p>Because my ultimate goal is to have this working for mobile platforms, I&#39;ve been testing against my iPhone (at least until I&#39;ve got an iPad). Here&#39;s some screens:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss4.jpg" alt="" title="I even gave it a schwanky icon."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss5.jpg" alt="" title="Lookin&#39; fine!"></p>
<p>I haven&#39;t yet implemented scaling to the device&#39;s screen size (the screen above was pinch-zoomed to the correct size).</p>
<p>I&#39;m okay with the graphics stack for the time being, so I&#39;m going to begin work on one of the last major hurdles with jumping between different scenario files. I&#39;m hoping to have an open beta up soon and hopefully get some feedback from people with various devices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Somewhere around the time I began working at Wal-Mart, I thought it would be a nice challenge to write an <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/one-week-anniversary/">NES emulator</a>. One of these days I&#39;ll release my mess of source code for that, but it was probably one of the most awesome programming challenges I&#39;ve ever undertaken. So, why am I waxing nostalgic about this project from nearly six years ago? (warning - there&#39;s technical programmy talk inside)

Why is it that if you&#39;re going to try to teach a kid something it has to be packaged in a brightly colored, make-the-kids-talk-to-the-TV-like-they&#39;re-actually-doing-something-and-then-proceed-to-talk-down-to-them package (Say MAP! What? I can&#39;t hear you? You gotta speak SPANISH, dipshit!). Well, I tell you what. Back in my day, we had AWESOME educational TV! Allow me a meander down memory lane...

My mom tipped me off some years ago that one can curb these offers by using their own self-addressed stamped envelopes against them to have oneself removed from their mailing list.</p>
<p>Using the power of a form letter, I&#39;ve done this with great success over the years. However, I&#39;ve been getting a little more personal and creative lately, putting my box of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/crayola-commercial/">Rejection Crayons</a> to good use. These are the latest in my wave of &quot;stop the spam&quot; mail campaign.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Squid Girl is an awesome show and you can expect to see my review come year&#39;s end.</p>

<p>If you were unfortunate enough to have sat through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-top-5-list/">top 5 anime video</a>, you&#39;ll know that Clannad was pretty high up there on the list (number one, to be exact). To this day, I still consider it my favorite anime so when I wandered past a &quot;Clannad - Motion Picture&quot; DVD at Hastings, I had to rent it even though I knew it was going to be terrible.</p>
<p>I had no idea just how bad it was going to be. Ah, where to begin?
