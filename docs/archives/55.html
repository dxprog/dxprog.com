YPNgine: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/YPNgine.zip">Download</a></p>
<p>Sometime in 2003 I became the administrator of YPN. Not entirely sure why, but there it was. As all the other admins left, so went their involvement in the future engine of YPN, partyfish. For reasons I cannot remember, I too stopped development of partyfish even though it was near complete.</p>
<p>But, I didn&#39;t drop the idea of a new engine and leave YPN in the capable hands of sasq2 and phpBB. No, I began writing my own CMS: YPNgine. Even with just a handful of months of PHP experience, I&#39;d tasked myself to create a multi-user CMS with various levels of administration, a document library and fully functional forum that needed, at least to the users, all the functionality of the old phpBB. No small task indeed.</p>
<p>But I pounded away at it no doubt learning many, many things along the way. I even <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/ypengine-forums-broken-and-a-mysterious-mirror-or-something.html">opened</a> it up to a <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/cant-sign-up-on-ypengine.html">public</a> <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/ypngine-error.html">beta</a>, though I cannot for the life of my think of where this was hosted (somewhere on an FSF server, no doubt).</p>
<p>Going through the changelog comments I left int the source files and performing a delta against the final post on <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/ypngines-coming-the-goose-is-getting-fat.html">this</a> thread, YPNgine took somewhere in the range of two months to develop. I do remember quite keenly when I actually turned this thing live. The first week was nothing but bug reports and security issues. They all got squashed, but in the end between the issues and the requested features, I decided that the entire model I had built YPNgine around was unsustainable, but that&#39;s a story for a different day.</p>
<p>I am actually writing this post because I am releasing all of the source code from the last &quot;build&quot; of YPNgine to the public. You can use that link at the top, or download it <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/YPNgine.zip">here</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>With the addition of search, the circle is complete</h2><time>January 22, 2011</time><div><p>Sometime in late 2002, I was welcomed on to the <a href="http://partyfish.sf.net/">partyfish</a> dev team. My first task: create the site wide search. Now, bear in mind that this was my first time really doing anything in PHP and search is quite a big thing. Ask Google. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d back me up.</p>
<p>Today, some eight years later, I have implemented site search into my website. Of course, it&#39;s running circles around my original code in terms of complexity, speed and even the amount of lines it&#39;s implemented in (340 v 70).</p>
<p>Here are some of the fun things the new search can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searches through all content types and each type can display differently in search results</li>
<li>All searches are weighted against where the terms were matched. The algorithm is such: (matches in title <em> 10) + (matched tags </em> 5) + matches in body</li>
<li>As with all aspects of my site, the search has a RESTful interface so I could make an ajaxy instant search if I so desired</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some good queries to show off what it can do:</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.com/search/rock%20band/">Rock Band</a> - Example where weighting really helps
<a href="http://dxprog.com/search/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> - Example of different document types</p>
<p>btw, if you wanted to see the old partyfish search code, <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/search.txt">here you go.</a> The new search stuff will be added to the repository shortly and I&#39;ll be making that public very soon.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>2010 Reviews - Finale</h2><time>January 17, 2011</time><div><p>Well, here is the final installment of the 2010 anime review. Sadly, my bros are now college students and, given the have homework and what have you, you&#39;re left with mostly just my reviews. But, there it is.</p>
<h2 id="angel-beats">Angel Beats</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_angel_beats.jpg" alt="" title="Angel Beats">
Angel Beats is a venture from many of the staff of Key, creators of Kanon, Air and Clannad. It follows the souls of a group of high school students who have died and are trapped in a sort of limbo, trying to find peace with their previous lives.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - I&#39;m a sucker for all things Key, so it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed Angel Beats. It has a good cast of characters and an interesting premise, with moments that can swing from plain ridiculous - any episode where they go to the Guild - to absolutely depressing - Yuri&#39;s back story comes to mind. The animation is top notch and the show has it&#39;s fair share of good songs, too (my favorite would be the closer, Brave Song). I look forward to an NA release. - <strong>8/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="air">Air</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_air.jpg" alt="" title="Air">
Adapted from the Key visual novel of the same name, Air follows the exploits of vagabond Yukito Kunisaki as he arrives in a town on his journey to find fabled &quot;girl in the sky.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Air kind of has a slow start. As with Clannad and Kanon, it attempts to touch on the storylines of all the girls, but a lot of it just doesn&#39;t seem to fit with what becomes the main storyline about half way through the series. Once that kicks in, though, the story becomes something rather unique and wholly interesting. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toradora!</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_toradora.jpg" alt="" title="Toradora!">
Taiga Aisaka and Ryuji Takasu are high school students who are to shy to confess their feelings to the ones they love. Seeing this commonality (and that each one of them is going after the other&#39;s best friend), Taiga and Ryuji band together to help each other pursue their object of affection.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Toradora! is probably the best new show I&#39;ve seen this year. It has a cast of fantastic characters (both main and supporting), a story that moves at just the right pace and manages to make you laugh while still tugging at the heart strings. The art style is something unique, being somewhat more angular than standard romcom fare, but is definitely top notch. Finally, all the opener and closer songs are freakin&#39; awesome! Oh, and lastly finally, it gets my award for best box set of the year. - <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kanon (2006)</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_kanon.jpg" alt="" title="Kanon">
Kyoto Animation&#39;s adaptation of the 90s Key visual novel, Kanon. Yuichi Aizawa has just moved in with his aunt and cousin who he&#39;s not seen in ages in a town he&#39;s not visited since childhood; only problem is, he&#39;s forgotten most of that childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Of all the girl laden anime shows I&#39;ve watched, Kanon is the only one I really consider to be a harem show, and Yuichi is a pimp daddy to be reckoned with. He bops from one girl to the next without ever looking back. This is that side effect that seems to come with translating visual novels to screen. That all said, I really enjoyed Kanon as it&#39;s just a great feel-good show that&#39;s a nice watch if you just want something mildly above fluff. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="strike-witches">Strike Witches</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_strike_witches.jpg" alt="" title="Strike Witches">
Strike Witches is set in an alternate reality sometime during World War II. An unknown alien force known as the Neuroi is wreaking havoc on the world and it&#39;s up to a squadron of young witches.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - There&#39;s no other way to say this: Strike Witches is selling itself solely on fan service. Sure, all the characters fly around shooting down aircraft and are named after famed WWII fighters, but they also never wear pants and are all young girls. This show somehow manages to cram in a panty shot where you never thought a panty shot would be possible. That said, it skirts (and crosses probably) the lolicon line many, many times. The story, while certainly unique in its setting, is only mildly engaging and ultimately forgettable. - <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="gurren-lagann">Gurren Lagann</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_gurren_lagann.jpg" alt="" title="Gurren Lagann">
<strong>Jeff</strong> - Is there a more perfect anime than &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;? No, probably not. &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; kept hitting golden notes through every episode, from the deaths of certain characters, to the changes that happen over the duration of the story. The pace is quick and satisfying, the characters are excellent, and the symbolism is downright impressive, but it doesn&#39;t stop there. This show has managed to instill in me a permanent desire to fulfill my ambitions no matter what they may be. If it fails to do the same with you, then you are doomed to be left behind as the world moves ahead with it&#39;s drill, each revolution driving it foreward to pierce the heavens. Who the hell do you think we are!? - <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<p>So, there it is. Here&#39;s looking forward to some fantastic shows in 2011!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Collab of Reviews - Part 2</h2><time>January 3, 2011</time><div><p>Alright, here we are at round two of the Super Hackmann Bros. &quot;Shit we watched in 2010&quot; anime review. It&#39;s a little shorter today as we were all down with the sickness at various points last week, but rest assured more is to come.</p>
<h2 id="dai-mahou-touge-magical-witch-punie-chan-">Dai Mahou Touge (Magical Witch Punie-chan)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_punie.jpg" alt="" title="Dai Mahou Togue">
The story revolves around a young girl named Tanaka Punie who is princess of Magical Land. In order for her to become queen, however, she must become a transfer student in a Japanese high school. Crazy hi-jinks ensue.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
Unfortunately, while this show has plenty of crazy moments, nothing ever really lived up to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4i-F0gwwzs&amp;feature=related">clip that inspired me to watch it.</a> The show itself is a successor of sorts to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">Bokusatsu Tenshi</a>, but never comes close in terms of production or entertainment value. It feels like it&#39;s trying to do the same type of thing, but just doesn&#39;t have the good writing and characters that Bokusatsu Tenshi does. - <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
I have even less to say about this. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Wow, this show is weird.  It shows an anthropomorphic potato peeling itself, which is a testament to just how weird it is.  Unfortunately, this weirdness isn&#39;t enough to make the four episode series very funny.
The first episode is great, maintaining its comic energy throughout, but once the second episode comes around it&#39;s already losing momentum.  That&#39;s not to say that the final three episodes are bad, because they do contain some genuinely funny moments, but between those moments of win it rarely becomes more than mild entertainment.
For a short series though, you could do worse. <strong>6/10</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-meloncholy-of-haruhi-suzumiya-season-2">The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - Season 2</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_haruhi.jpg" alt="" title="The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - Season 2"></p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
Season 2 of Haruhi caused a lot of controversy when it came out for the middle string of episodes entitled The Endless Eight. Yes, it&#39;s pretty much the same exact episode eight times, but it didn&#39;t bother me as much as I&#39;m sure it did my brothers (eight episodes with swimsuit scenes? Hell yes! (I didn&#39;t say that…)). Both the first and last episode arcs (Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and Sigh of Haruhi respectively) offer some of what was great with the first six episodes of the first season, but it doesn&#39;t seem to captivate quite as well. Regardless, this is still an excellent entry in the series. - <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
If you&#39;re going to watch this, then allow me to make the following suggestion: Watch &quot;Endless Eight&quot; episodes 1, 4, and 8. It will be far more tolerable like that. Trust me. It wasn&#39;t quite as engrossing as the first season, either. - <strong>5/10</strong> (Dinged it because of the &quot;Endless Eight&quot;. Would&#39;ve been higher if the studio hadn&#39;t pulled that stunt. Otherwise, it could&#39;ve had a 8/10)</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
The second season of Haruhi is good, but not great.
The Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody episode starts this season out well, working just as well as any of the first season one shot episodes.  Then you get the Endless Eight.
Now, I&#39;m not going to deny that this arc is interesting, as the concept is unique and well executed, and I can see that the creators were shooting for a certain feeling in the viewers.
But eight times.  Eight times I watched the same episode with slight changes, and that probably pissed me off.  They could have at least thrown some new events into the mix, the likes of which were alluded to but nothing done with them.  Instead, the only real changes we got were some different camera angles and Koizumi wearing a speedo.  My eyes can&#39;t unsee that.
Thankfully, that wraps up well and the following arc goes back to what we know and love from the series, helping to wash done the season as a whole.
But that <em>speedo</em>. - <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="karin">Karin</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_karin.jpg" alt="" title="Karin"></p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
I do not like Vampires or anything Halloween related, even more so now that vampires are gay, angsty teenagers who sparkle in the sunlight. That said, the titular character of Karin is a vampire. Or rather, she&#39;s an un-vampire, injecting blood into her victims instead of the other way around. This is an interesting little romantic comedy that I didn&#39;t like initially but came to really enjoy. Througout its twenty-four episodes, it never really deviates too much from the main plot; that is, developing the relationship between Karin and her classmate Usui Kenta. The last couple of episodes are certainly intense and will leave you wondering what path the show will take. So, even with my general dislike for occultish things, Karin is worth a watch. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Re-review</strong> - After having rewatched the show and read the entire manga series, I would have to say that the manga is definitely far more fleshed out than the anime. Also, as I have been subjected to far better shows since, I will admit that the artwork and voice acting (Japanese or English) are not the greatest ever. As an addendum to Jeff&#39;s review, the show (as opposed to the manga) did have a lot of unnecessary fan service. Still, I hold by my 7 rating as it is still an entertaining show.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
This could&#39;ve also been called &quot;Big Titted Vampire Bitches.&quot; - <strong>?/10</strong> (he left no score)</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
I&#39;m having trouble sorting my thoughts on this one, but here it goes.
On the good side, Karin stays entertaining throughout, with a decent plot and some likeable characters.  One of those characters, Winner, is actually exclusive to the show and ends up being one of the greater sources of comic relief.
On the other hand, the plot doesn&#39;t follow the arguably stronger version found in the manga, shooting off relatively early on its own tangent. The art also doesn&#39;t hold up well, due to the somewhat lackluster skills of the original author, Yuna Kagesaki.
Overall though, it&#39;s a fairly solid show. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>So, there is our latest wave. Expect at least two more sets of reviews to go up in the near future.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>2011 - To do what must be done</h2><time>January 1, 2011</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/newyear11.jpg" alt="" title="Celebrating the Year of the Rabbit">
The Chinese zodiac says that this year is the year of the rabbit. Finally, reason for me to stuff a picture of Haruhi and cast sporting bunny outfits at the top of a post. But, this isn&#39;t what I&#39;m here to discuss.</p>
<p>It is indeed a new year and with new years come waves and waves of resolutions. In years prior, I openly shunned the idea of making new years resolutions. Why wait for some celestial anomoly to make changes to yourself as a person? While I still hold to this belief, I now view the changing of the calendar as a time to reflect upon/mark milestones within one&#39;s life. That said, here is my list of things I would like to accomplish in 2011.[break]</p>
<p><strong>1. Draw more.</strong> I&#39;m forever complaining about that my artistic skills are not where I&#39;d like them to be. There really is only one remedy for this and that is practice. So, I am endeavoring to draw everyday this year in hopes that I&#39;ll be less sucky by 2012.</p>
<p><strong>2. Finish all my Squeenix games.</strong> I have a shelf full of games I&#39;ve never finished, but the large majority of them are Square games. So, in 2011, I will buy no new games until I&#39;ve completed the following (in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy X-2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy XII</li>
<li>Final Fantasy XIII</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>
<li>The World Ends With You
With diligent play, I could be done with these by my brithday.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Lose the spare tire.</strong> Since my fat brother started working at Wal-mart, he is no longer the fat brother. That title now belongs to me. So, as cliche as it is, I plan to start keeping my eating in check and going on more epic walks in hopes of leveling off the old stomach line.</p>
<p><strong>4. Apartment and girlfriend.</strong> The largest and most difficult items to procure on this list. Unfortunately, the latter relies on the former and the former is solely at the mercy of my pay check which cannot support the notion of either. Without going into detail, there are plans to fix this.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s the list of things I want to do this year. Call them resolutions or whatever you wish, I&#39;m going to call it my Checklist-o-Shit-to-Do(R). Hope everybody has a happy new year or at least survives it!</p>
<p>btw - today is one of two times that the date will be not only a palindrome but also repeating this year.</p>
