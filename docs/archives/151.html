This whole Facebook debacle has nary phased me as the whole point I post things on there is for selfless promotion and narcissistic reasons. I want people to read those things. But, there are a couple things I hand out to only an elite few people: my phone number and the privilege of Skyping me. This latter one is especially fun for me.</p>
<p>Sometimes during conversations, something interesting will be said that sets me off on a journey to Photoshop to concoct a visual representation of said mutterings. The fruits of these labors are interesting indeed and I present them here for your enjoyment.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Peace, Quiet and Solitude</h2><time>June 15, 2010</time><div><p>I am in the realizing that it&#39;s been nearly a month since I last blogged anything, granted this comes on the heels of an unusually active period for me. But, hey. Nothing terribly exciting has happened, so there it is.</p>
<p>I decided that last week would be a pretty good week to blow a whole bunch of my paid vacation time... after all, the best day of the year happened to fall in that week (hint: my birthday). It was nice to just forget about the world around me and piddle around quietly the way I used to back in the days when I was <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/pretty-pictures-abound/">without work.</a> I churned out no less than three distinct (but wholly unfinished) projects.</p>
<p>The first of these is a UX re-imagining for my ongoing project, the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. Now that I am a far better JavaScript guru than I was when this was originally written, I&#39;ve decided to take a completely different approach in terms of user presentation (though, the underlying functionality is pretty much the same).</p>
<p>Another thing I did was start in on learning some more HTML5 canvas stuffs, as it provides a pretty sweet opportunity for gaming purposes. I started messing around with coding a simple <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/gameEngine/">drawing framework</a> and, at the behest of my <a href="http://square-headed.com/entry/announcing-the-official-launch-of-3dview/">osu! fanatical brother</a>, began attempting a <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/eba_html5/">clone of sorts for that</a>. Ultimately, I made some good progress and the canvas object is certainly a powerful tool, but there are some simple things that it simply can&#39;t do that keeps Flash at the advantage (I&#39;m looking at you, per blit alpha).</p>
<p>Other than these few programming things and a goodly amount of time with my nose in books, it was a slothful week to be sure. But, then again, that&#39;s the whole point of &quot;vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>Tune in this weekend as I head to yet another anime con.</p>
