Comment posting still doesn&#39;t work and the &quot;My Digg&quot; bar is broken, but I think this is probably one of the best designs I&#39;ve had in a while. But don&#39;t take my word for it, <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/new_design.png">see for yourselves.</a> The comic page is also done in this style, though it&#39;s not quite working yet.</p>

This is actually some concept art for an upcoming comic. I&#39;m trying to work more emotion into the characters&#39; body language.</p>

Originally started out as just some kid, but give him the right hair and you have First-grader Gabe!</p>

Captain Jack is back!</p>

A quick sketch of my hand. An <a href="http://www.cubetoons.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=1">exercise</a> prescribed by JKR.</p>
<p>Well, there you are. One semi-interesting thing to note is that Captain Haddock is the only drawing here done with a no. 2 pencil. Everything else was done using my wonderful 0.7 Pentel mechanical pencil. Oh, it is a thing of beauty :-)</p>

I&#39;d check to see how things were coming on Toshiba&#39;s website, but I don&#39;t have my service order number or anything (left it at the UPS store :-P) so I&#39;ll just have to be pleasently surprised when it gets here. Driving me nuts, though, because my bros&#39; computer is fritzin&#39; out so I&#39;m having to resort to other &quot;activities&quot; to keep me entertained. Mainly drawing. Actually, I&#39;d like to think that my artwork has evolved quite a bit since even the last comic I made (before the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54184/">Paint Chronicles</a>, that is).</p>
<p>Speaking of the comic, I&#39;ve got a bunch of ideas lined up and ready to go. I&#39;ve got the last part to the DB of Life about half colored, another one scanned and a couple others I&#39;ve drawn over the last few days. Another thing I&#39;m going to do when my laptop gets back is redesign the F5 part of the website. It&#39;s kind of bland looking now, and apparently script <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/">isn&#39;t working</a> (that&#39;s supposed to take you to the Paint Chronicles).</p>
<p>I&#39;m planning on going to see Pirates 2 in a couple weeks. Tried to watch the first one the other night, but our DVD is scratched or something so we only got about half way through. While I&#39;m on the subject of motion picture entertainment, I&#39;ve started watching Lost. Not too bad of a show, really. A little gorey, but intruiging. And finally, they released the teaser for the new Spider-man... I am not amused. Three (at least) bad guys, Harry included which burns me to no end, and it looks like they&#39;re going to toss MJ aside like a bag of moldy tangerines. Sam Raimi, ya screwed up!</p>
<p>Work&#39;s not going too bad. I got a raise a couple weeks ago, so I&#39;m netting a nice sum of money every other week. I&#39;m scheduled to push carts all next week, which I&#39;m thankful for as I&#39;ll miss the pre-4th of July rush. I&#39;ve also got three day weekends coming the next two weeks so life is good. Gives me plenty of time to do all I&#39;ve talked about above ;-).</p>
<p>Speaking of money, next week on one of my days off, I think I&#39;m going to trot down to the bank and see about getting a loan so I can get my car. I can&#39;t even get a stupid credit card because I have no credit score, so we&#39;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Well, that should catch everything up for a while (it&#39;s been forever since I last blogged like that :-P). I may try to import all my old blog posts to WordPress when my laptop gets back, as well. It would seem fitting as I&#39;ve now been filling you all in on the useless details of my life for over a year now. It&#39;s been one crazy, crazy year, too. House renovation, moving, job, and all of it forever immortalized on the Internet. Cheers!</p>

Not sure what happened to Yoda&#39;s pupils there :-P</p>

Just some shirtless, blue haired dude with a board</p>
<p>I&#39;ll probably put some more stuff up tomorrow. Whoo :-P</p>
