This reminded me of the big stink that nerds raised last year on 11-11-11 and how it was the &quot;last binary date of our generation&quot;.</p>
<p>But, nerds. You should know this wasn&#39;t true.</p>
<p>Yes, 111111 is 63 and, no, we&#39;re never going to encounter a date like that again in our lifetimes or in the next thousand years, for that matter. But for any nerd to try and assume that 11-11-11 is a valid date is stupid. There was this little thing a few years ago called Y2K.</p>
<p>You may recall it.</p>
<p>The whole issue with Y2K, for those who don&#39;t recall or never knew, was in the data depiction of years in a date. The first two digits were discarded and only the last two saved. Computers automatically stuffed a &quot;19&quot; in front and called it a day. Obviously, when those two stored digits were &quot;00&quot;, all the dates would read 1900 and there would be mass pandemonium.</p>
<p>But, since the crossing of the (almost) new millennium, we&#39;ve had to differentiate by storing the entire date, meaning all years would be stored/displayed as a four digit number.</p>
<p>So, in nerd terms, there never <em>was</em> a 11-11-11, just 11-11-2011 (or, 20111111 if you like being able to sort your dates numerically). And now that we can store dates ranging from 1/1/0001 to 12/31/9999, there was no excuse for the &quot;whooaaahh&quot; moment.</p>
<p>Now, January 19, 2038 03:14:08? <em>That&#39;s</em> something to look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">forward to</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>When Your Foods Combine...</h2><time>July 8, 2012</time><div><p><a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> is a great place to kill time with somewhat similarly like-minded people. It&#39;s a great place for comedy, feels, and elitism. As it turns out, it&#39;s also a great place for crazy awesome food ideas such as <a href="http://imgur.com/a/avjMU">pizza cupcakes</a>.</p>
<p>That photo series is scant on details, but there&#39;s really no recipe to follow here. I used the recipe on the back of a package of pizza yeast, stuffed into muffin tins, and filled with deliciousness - pizza sauce, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, and mozzarella (the stuff you find in the hispanic section, not shredded). Stuff in a 400F oven for 10-15 minutes (depending on how you like your crust) and you get amazingness:</p>
