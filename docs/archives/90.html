Must get awful picture off the front page!</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve mentioned before that I&#39;m eagerly awaiting Eternal Sonata, the RPG making its way towards Xbox 360 sometime in September. Actually, it was a (if not <em>the</em>) primary reason I bought the console in the first place. Halo is good and all, but my heart lies with RPGs and other story type games (i.e. Pheonix Wright).</p>
<p>So, anyways, I&#39;d heard from a fairly reliable source that the latest Xbox magazine had a demo disc with ES on it. Almost immediately I went out and purchased a copy (I wasn&#39;t the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/07/18">only one</a>). But, with these thing rarely is the pot of gold so easily obtained. Nay, the bastard disc wouldn&#39;t load. Well, it would but it would only give me small nuggets of which I hungered for only to choke mere mintes (or less) into said meal. I was pissed.</p>
<p>Lucky for me I went back an reread the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/07/18">news post</a> for the comic I referenced up above and it held a small morsel of hope. An obscure reference to something about <a href="http://forum.teamxbox.com/showthread.php?t=517777">boiling discs</a> to resurrect them from DVD hell. I didn&#39;t really expect much but I needed to play this demo (and I didn&#39;t really want to be gypped out of $8.99). So I nuked some water in the microwave and slipped the disc in. Much to my surprise all problems were erased and I was one with the game... until the demo ended.</p>
<p>As for the game itself it is pure joy encapsulated inside a stream of binary ones and zeros. The artwork is fantastic, the gameplay is solid. I&#39;m hoping that the same will be said for the story as there isn&#39;t much sampling of that but from what I&#39;ve seem I think all will be well. It&#39;ll definitely be worth my sixty clams and will get me through the couple of weeks between when I move in and school starts.</p>
<p>Well, I think that was sufficient enough to get the evil off the front page. At least the initial load, that is. I would be careful about how far and how fast you scroll down the page.</p>

So I decided to do Midna today. There are parts of this picture I kind of like but overall I really hate it. First off she looks like a guy. Second her head is not wide enough and I scrwed up the shading on the face so it&#39;s hard to make out her eye. The body I&#39;m happier with than what it originally was, but it still seems... off. Ugh. Maybe whatever I draw tomorrow will be better.</p>

As such I have set up a little exercise for myself: select a theme each week and do a drawing every day. This week&#39;s theme, as the title suggests, is Zelda. Specifically, Twilight Princess. So I bring you my first &quot;masterpeice&quot;:</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not terribly thrilled with this. All I can say is I can&#39;t wait to get my Mac Book Pro from the school loaded with Photoshop so I can use tools I&#39;m already familiar with. My Prismas are nice, but they lack an undo function.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Frog_Kid.jpg"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Frog_Kid.jpg" alt="" title="Randomness...?"></a>
Some kid and a frog off the cover of a book my little brothers and sisters got from the library. I was originally just going to draw the kid (which I only drew because that&#39;s what was in front of my face), but the crowd that had gathered around me started chanting for the frog. So I drew the frog. Whatever.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for some more awesome stuff. Awesome stuff that isn&#39;t wierd kids and flying frogs.</p>

It was freakin&#39; sweet! He played pretty much every song off of Straight Out of Lynwood plus most of the mainstays (Eat It, Fat, Smells Like Nirvana, etc.). For the encore he played the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjJYywFNbuw">cellphone song</a> to which everybody, myself included, started waving their cellphones. After that he wound up with an extended version of Albuquerque. It was simply awesome. I shunned my quiet exterior and clapped and whooed and sang with everybody else. But, you&#39;re probably saying &quot;Shuddup, give us teh pix!&quot; I&#39;ve only got a few because getting good pictures with the crazy lighting so I&#39;m only giving you the good ones. Sucks to be you.
