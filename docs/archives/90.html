<p>In my opinion, the best artwork I&#39;ve done to date. Not necessarily the best joke ever, but it was good enough to hit the Joystiq poll so I call it even.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. I did a Michael Jackson joke. Please forgive me.</p>

<p>A little late, but it&#39;s better than most of my <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/70642/">filler</a> <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/80390/">crap</a> so I call it even.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Comics and Updates</h2><time>February 6, 2007</time><div><p>I haven&#39;t been posting here very much lately. Why? Well... I dunno :-P. Firstly, though, I&#39;ll get the comic links up to speed:</p>
<p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/104870/">Plan 4 World Peace</a> (filler)
The Fruit Saga, Parts <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/106143/">1</a>, <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/108024/">2</a>, and <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/110979/">3</a>.</p>
<p>The fruit saga is more or less based on real life. I did purchase a Mac mini with my tax refund and, despite my years of rampant Mac hatred, I must admit that it is a nifty piece of hardware. I do have a copy of Vista installed (thanks to bootcamp), but I haven&#39;t booted out of OS X in several days. I haven&#39;t done much more than piddle around with stuff, but I&#39;m going to start learning the APIs and maybe write a game.</p>
<p>Full Sail, my college of choice, has been &quot;pestering&quot; me lately and I guess I need to call them back and start getting things setup to sail away in the fall. I&#39;m not sure what kind of course I want to take. Back when I heard about them it was game programming hands down, but I do enjoy drawing and would like to do more film projects. It&#39;s a real toss up. I may go with game programming yet because, of those three options, it&#39;s probably my strongest area. We&#39;ll see, though...</p>
<p>As far as work goes, it&#39;s pretty much usual. I&#39;m cashier mostly, but since I recieved my CSM powers I&#39;ve been doing that some too. Just yesterday, in fact, they pulled me off a register to cover for somebody whilst they went on break. I&#39;m sitting in a pretty sweet position in that I can do almost anything in the store from CSMing, to cashiering, to cart pushing, to unloading trucks, etc.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ll close this blog post with a little piece of my art featuring Basch, my favorite character from FFXII:</p>

<p>My new 19&quot; widescreen LCD monitor is indeed a thing of beauty, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily kiss.</p>
