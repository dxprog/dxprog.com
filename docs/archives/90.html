<p>Haven&#39;t made one of these in a while. I was digging through some of my old stuff the other day and found my little comic ideas notebook. I always did like this one and I&#39;m not sure why I never made it. This and <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54176/">Pikachunks</a> were actually written at the same time and were supposed to &quot;air&quot; back to back. But, anyhoo...</p>
<p>Since I can&#39;t use Photoshop anymore and since GIMP sucks I had to ink the comic by hand. BY HAND! Actually, it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Not to say that it is without problems but it works.</p>

Well it&#39;s back, only not quite so themed. The reason I stopped in the first place is because thqat Midna picture really bummed me out. It sucked. Hard core.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve actually got two days worth of drawing goodness, so I&#39;ll give you the first one:</p>

My Guitar Hero guitar. Take special note of the Limozeen and Teen Girl Squad stickers. Okay, they&#39;re kind of hard to see.</p>
<p>Yuna, a la Final Fantasy X</p>
<p>Some teacup from my sisters&#39; tea set.</p>

Mario as seen in Mario Sunshine (an awesome game). I&#39;m really pleased with how that came out. Also, there&#39;s Toad. I wasn&#39;t really trying to get a good shape or anything, I just wanted something to test my new pens out on. Up at the top is a little tuft of hair. Just wanted to practice some hair shading.</p>
<p>Keep those RSS readers tuned to here for more arty updates. And other.... stuff.</p>

Asshole mode... ENGAGED!</p>
<p><strong>dxprog</strong>
You may bow to me whenever.</p>
<p><strong>anicro pattern maker</strong>
Anicro sucks ass. You should use <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/files/acpd.zip">AC Pattern Designer</a></p>
<p><strong>honda</strong>
They make cars. Chevy&#39;s are better.</p>
<p><strong>qualities of a cashier should possesed</strong>
Don&#39;t be a douche bag. Make sure you redline. Don&#39;t let customers walk all over you. Only you have the power to take their money. If you didn&#39;t they&#39;d be stealing. Also, try going to school and learning proper grammer. It works wonders.</p>
<p><strong>hawk</strong>
Is not nearly as cool as an eagle.</p>
<p><strong>phoenic driver sound</strong>
What the hell? Is somebody driving sound? Mad?</p>
<p><strong>bad news on full sail recording arts program</strong>
Bad news. You weren&#39;t accepted.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:**twilight.princess@gmail.com">**twilight.princess@gmail.com</a>**
You should have bought it when it was up on ebay.</p>
<p><strong>pedro s got your back</strong>
Yes. Yes he does.</p>
<p><strong>mikes hard lemonade myspace layouts</strong>
MySpace sucks hard enough without you going and screwing it up with some sort of booze oriented layout.</p>
<p><strong>fullsail college</strong>
It is the college equivelent of Chuck Norris. It kicks you and all your family&#39;s asses.</p>
<p><strong>full sail horrible</strong>
You misspelled awesome. It&#39;s &quot;A W E S O M E&quot;, not &quot;H O R R I B L E&quot;. No wonder they turned you down.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#39;t sufficiently answer what ever it was you were googling obviously you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking for in the first place.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/life-as-an-internet-microcelebrity">Life as an Internet Microcelebrity</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 20, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>If you frequent digg you no doubt saw <a href="http://www.careerdistinction.com/onlineid/step1.html">this</a> a while back. For those who don&#39;t enjoy clicking links to find out pertinent information, it&#39;s a page that calculates how &quot;famous&quot; you are on the internet. I&#39;ll say this isn&#39;t entirely foolproof. All calculations are done via google search results, but it gives you somewhat of an idea about your... uniqueness.</p>
<p>Anyways, for fun I fed the information for a search of &quot;dxprog&quot; in and it turns out I&#39;ve got 10/10 points for being a microcelebrity. Cool, I suppose. But like I said, it&#39;s more about uniqueness and the fact that I&#39;ve stuck with one online moniker through my entire time on the internet helps. It also helps that I am the only person going by dxprog. The little calculation wouldn&#39;t work nearly as well if there were others who went by that handle.</p>
<p>This may sound egeotistical, but every once and again I google myself just to see what&#39;s been indexed about me. I&#39;ve kept a fairly open internet life so it&#39;s not hard to turn up a bunch of relevent results. First thing that pops up is this site, followed by my Digg profile, Digital Double/my Smackjeeves profile and a couple of videos. Sadly, the first video is the one that I loathe with all the hatred I can muster. But, that aside, this is a pretty good synopsis of myself as it stands currently.</p>
<p>The origins of my online presence, however, are seemingly lost forever in the Sea of Digital Bits we call the internet. All that exists of my very first web page is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/protontorp2/">gone</a> and since YPN has been screwed, none of that exists either. Actually, that&#39;s not true. YPN&#39;s entire history is sitting on a CD-R on my desk. Every last iteration, from sasq2 to Tetra 2. I&#39;ve even got the unfinished beta of <a href="http://partyfish.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=screenshots">partyfish</a>. But, I digress.</p>
<p>There are a few old things that are harbored on the same disc as said YPN stuff that I&#39;ve lovingly added to the archives (see the 2003 stuff on the right there). Nothing terribly interesting or deep, but it gives some insight as to what I was doing at the time (not a whole hell of a lot). But, then again, I was only sixteen and not much was really expected of me.</p>
<p>Well, this has been yet another fun trip down memory lane. Not sure why I post these things, but in twenty years it&#39;ll be interesting to go back and read everything. I&#39;ll probably think about myself now what I think of my former self: what a douchebag.</p>
