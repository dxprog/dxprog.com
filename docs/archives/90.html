<p>Here we are at day three and already I&#39;m forced to talk about the death of things dear to me. No, not Andy Griffith (though, I did see my fair share of him when my dad went through his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series">Matlock</a>) phase in the early 90s).</p>
<p>For over half a decade, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> has been the sight that has greeted me as I started my browser and many times when I clicked the &quot;home&quot; button of my browser (a button I&#39;ve had to explicitly enable in Chrome). But soon, this will be <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html">no more</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;d had a hunch that iGoogle was getting less than stellar treatment lately as it became very difficult to make iGoogle my default page for google.com and also when its design was broken through their extensive redesigning. Perhaps the personal web portal is passe at this point, but I will surely miss it. iGoogle has provided me with an at-a-glance preview of my mail and a handful of other website snippets since its inception in 2005.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&#39;ve been using less and less of the gadgets (or whatever they call them), slowly being culled down from my email and RSS feeds from various websites and webcomics to just mail, a deviantArt gadget that I don&#39;t pay attention to anymore, and the RSS feed from my <a href="http://www.square-headed.com/">brother&#39;s comic</a>. Outside of the casual overview of my email, I don&#39;t really take advantage of functionality of iGoogle anymore as I&#39;ve moved away to better, dedicated applications and sites such as <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and the ever present <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, I&#39;m a programmer, dammit! I can build myself a site that not only provides the same functionality I used before, but make it better, faster, stronger, and more tailored to my needs! I have sixteen months to replace the death row inmate that is iGoogle and replace it I shall.</p>
<p>I shall...</p>

<p>Some time ago, I came to the realization that I could (for free) check out movies from the local library. As convenience would have it, the library is about half a mile from my place of work, so it provides an excellent reason to get in some exercise during my lunch break.</p>
<p>Last week - on one of these very journeys - I was perusing the blu-ray section and ran across a couple of films. One I&#39;d seen, the other not: <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>  and <em>Blade Runner</em> respectively. Now, I shouldn&#39;t have to remind you of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/2000wtf/">feelings for <em>2001</em></a>, but I thought perhaps my six years of maturation since having watched it initially may have changed things. <em>Blade Runner</em> I picked up partially based on glowing reviews from a coworker, partially because I felt I was going to need some badass 80s action movie to pick me up after rewatching <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>Well, I fucked that one up.</p>
<p><em>2001</em> was watched first and, for the most part, my feelings towards the movie are mostly the same; it&#39;s slow, it doesn&#39;t make much sense, but the special effects are quite incredible for the time. About half way through the movie, I threw up my arms in defeat and got wasted. Inebriation didn&#39;t help much my enjoyment of the movie nor did it provide any epiphanies (I suspect that only getting stoned is going to help you there). But, that was okay. I knew going in about what to expect and I still had some Harrison Ford awesomeness to look forward to.</p>
<p>Only I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Because, in many ways, <em>2001</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> are very similar movies: they&#39;re both slow, they both don&#39;t make much sense, and they both have very good effects for their time. I went into <em>Blade Runner</em> expecting an action flick starring one of the best action stars of all time - something akin to Die Hard - but, instead I got a noir film set in a dystopian future that focuses on android&#39;s rights. Not what I was expecting at all.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t lie - and keeping in mind what I was expecting - I did not very much enjoy <em>Blade Runner</em>. Firstly, I&#39;m not entirely partial to dark films (both figuratively and literally in this case) and I&#39;ll give <em>2001</em> props for at least being a hopeful movie. Secondly, the soundtrack for <em>Blade Runner</em> is so 80s psychedelic that it almost made me feel like I was tripping balls despite the fact that I was entirely sober for that film. <em>2001</em>, on the other hand, uses nothing but classical music for its score, so point again. Finally, <em>Blade Runner</em>&#39;s basic premise of &quot;what are the rights of a manufactured life form&quot; has been done <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor">time</a> and <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">again</a>. Also, while I did say it didn&#39;t make much sense, <em>Blade Runner</em> was at least a bit easier to piece together than <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say this, I have to say that I enjoyed <em>2001</em> much more than <em>Blade Runner</em>. I don&#39;t necessarily hate <em>Blade Runner</em>, but it&#39;s just not a movie suited to my tastes.</p>
