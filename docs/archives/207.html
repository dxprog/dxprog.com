So I guess I'll start by dropping this bomb: Hi.

Yesterday, as many know, I turned the magical 20. I can't even be called a teenager anymore, so basically all my ties with kiddom have been severed. Though, that hasn't stopped me from watching a cartoon I used to tune in to religously every morning: [The Super Mario Super Show](http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70045113&trkid=189530&strkid=11816394_1_0). The show itself actually isn't all the bad once you get past the fact that Bowser was named King Koopa back then and that the live action stuff oozes 80s. *sniff* It was a golden age.

Back to the present, however, I've been considering selling off my old NES collection and buying a used Xbox off eBay. The way I see it, not only would I be able to play Halo 2, but I'd probably soft-mod the thing and then I could run the stuff on emulator  (of games I own, mind you). Also, I could use the all powerful [Xbox Media Center (XBMC)](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/). The more I read about the thing the more I drool. It'll play basically any video/audio file you feed from anywhere (including the network). Talk about sweet justice.

In work related news, not much new. However, I believe I am going to become a lowly cart pusher. Now I know there are some questions on your mind, namely: But isn't that cut in pay? Won't you bake out in the sun? I wonder if this candy bar I found under the couch is still edible? The answers are yes, yes and you'll probably die if you eat it. Actually, three little words sum things up: shorts and free gatorade (wait, that's four...) But, I digress. I've always had more fun outside than inside and being stuck behind the register drives me insane (mainly the not moving part). I need to be moving and doing something. Take now for instance. My fingers are moving all over the place whilst my lazy butt relaxes in bed.

Well, I suppose I'll get to bed now. I'll try to have the comic finished and posted before I go to work tomorrow, otherwise look for it in the wee hours of Saturday morning.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/its-been-a-while">It&#x27;s been a while</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 9, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Save the comic posts and podcast, it&#39;s been a little bit since I&#39;ve written anything.

<p>I only post it early because I&#39;ve got to go to work soon. This is sort of my answer to <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060520/">this</a> and <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060602/">this</a>. I was supposed to hold up my end of the switcheroo, but I didn&#39;t really like the comic I made up so, meh :-P</p>

Aside from the outcome, this comic is absolultely, 100% true right down to the thought process going on in my head. I don't know how many times I've zoned out on what I was doing to focus on whatever programming problem faced me at the time, but it's pretty sad.</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/208.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/206.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
