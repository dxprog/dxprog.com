<p>First, and most importantly, I have finally gotten my GED. I will brag a little and post my scores:</p>
<p>Reading -  96%
Writing - 82%
Math - 99%
Science - 95%
Social Studies - 99%</p>
<p>Now those little percentages are how many people taking the GED in US are stupider than me, to put it not so nicely. Rather surprising, really, because I found the test to be incredibly simple. IMO, my essay did suck pretty bad. I was supposed to write about how I expected to be remembered which was kind of a lame topic to begin with. I am, usually, a fairly concise writer so coming up with 25 sentences on this topics was really, really hard. In the end I kind of wandered off topic talking about something else completely, but I had about 5 minutes to come up with an extra paragraph so I expanded on something I&#39;d touched on earlier. It sucked, trust me.</p>
<p>Since I have now hurdled hugh school the next logical step is college. Funny thing is that was lined up before my GED was. I have been accepted at Full Sail&#39;s school of awesomeness and will be taking the Digital Arts and Design degree. This means I will have to relocate myself to sunny Florida. Do I mind? Hell, no. Do my parents mind? I don&#39;t think so. Does everybody else mind even though it really isn&#39;t their business? Yes. I&#39;ve gotten more &quot;why would you move to Florida&quot; comments than I care to count. But, that aside, I&#39;m going to be attending the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; tour this weekend so I&#39;ll have plenty to blog about whilst I&#39;m there or when I get back. And don&#39;t worry, there&#39;ll be pictures and maybe some video.</p>
<p>Speaking of video, I&#39;m going to be making another faux commercial. I&#39;ve got the script ready, all I need to do is film, write some music, make some visuals, cut it all together in iMovie <strong>HD</strong> and put it up on YouTube.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, Chris got his electric guitar Monday and has been teaching himself to play (as have the rest of us). I will say this much: playing guitar is a bitch. I thought the piano was bad. At least it&#39;s pasture is much more spacous. Chris seems to be concentrating mostly on memorizing chords while I went and taught myself how to read tablatures and am trying to play stuff that&#39;s way out of my league (in my defense, however, I can play the first three notes of &quot;Sweet Child O Mine&quot;).</p>
<p>And, speaking of iMovie, I kind of moved away from OS X. I&#39;d been using it exclusively for quite some time and then Photoshop died. So I decided I&#39;d redownload it for Windows (I&#39;m a bastard that way) and I haven&#39;t really booted out of it since except to copy some files. I&#39;ve finally gotten more or less used to Vista. The interface, IMO, is more complicated now than it had been (especially the network dialogs). So I am, once again, a Windows man.</p>
<p>Well, I believe that shall tide the masses over at least until the weekend. Keep coming back as I will be blogging down in Florida (assuming our hotel has complimentary G, but it looks grim at this point). We shall see... we shall see...</p>

Seriously, this is absolutely insane. I missed everything until now because our router decided to die leaving me without internets. So, I've got things kind of working now, I go to check digg and there's about two pages of front page stories containing, in some way shape or form, the following hexadecimal number: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. I guess Digg got a cease and desist from the good old MP of double A and they started pulling any stories with the following string of numbers and letters: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. Well, people got ticked off because 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 is their favorite copy/paste fodder so they inundated the place with 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 this and 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 that and that's where it stands now. Apperantly K. Rose and Co. are allowing 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 to be shown all over the place and say that if it kills Digg that's fine since they went down with a mutha-09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 fight. Personally, if Digg goes down due to this I may start pirating ALL my movies just to let them know how pissed off I am.

Thanks, have a nice 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 day.

Oh, and let's think for a second. Why would you have a single encryption key for EVERYTHING!? You people are stupid bastards. G'Day. 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/175.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/173.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
