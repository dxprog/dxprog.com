<p>As the title suggests I own an Xbox 360. Now I can proudly call myself a Wii60 person. I&#39;ve been wanting one for a while mainyl for the Halo series but also it&#39;s extensive online cataloge of awesomeness. For instance I can download HD quality Headlines clips... FREE! It freakin&#39; owns. The only thing that&#39;s going to come back to haunt me some day is the small hard drive. I could&#39;ve bought an Elite but I got a Premium instead. I stupid. I own Crackdown and Halo 2. I was originally just going to rent Crackdown (for the H3 beta of course) but I tried the demo and was like &quot;Hey, this isn&#39;t a bad game&quot; so I bought it. Of course, I haven&#39;t necessarily been playing these games. No, I&#39;ve been playing Phoenic Wright 1. It still kicks ass. In fact I&#39;d go so far as to say that case number four was my favorite yet.</p>
<p>Well, I could go on about such things for a long time, but I think I shall get soome sleep.</p>

As you can see comments and categories are back. You can&#39;t necessarily comment yet, but things are in place for it. Also archives are gone at the moment but those should be up tonight sometime. It&#39;ll be the first thing I work on after I get back from work. Until then enjoy what is and forever will be... PurpleFusion!</p>
