It&#39;s a somewhat bittersweet feeling. It&#39;s awesome not to have to have the nightmares of work hanging over my head, but on the flipside I won&#39;t be able to hang around with all the pals I made over the last year and a half. Not to mention the seemingly endless supply of money is non-existant now. Oh well.</p>
<p>What really sucks, though, is the fact that I&#39;ve been sick the last several days. Actually it&#39;s more allergies than anything else. I blame the rotting vegitation due to receeding <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/tags/flood/">flood waters</a>.</p>
<p>I recently finished Crackdown. It&#39;s an awesome game but the ending really, really sucks. It sucked so bad I haven&#39;t played it since. Originally I bought Crackdown for the Halo 3 beta (which I never really played much) but the main game is still pretty sweet. I probably will start working on Final Fantasy XII again or maybe Halo 2. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t even finished Halo 1. Oh, Xbox 360 extended warranty ftw! I&#39;m no longer paranoid about using it.</p>
<p>Well, I have an important nap I have to take, so later!</p>

This time, however, is because our wonderful little town has been flooded. Since the river runs between me and my place of employment I am trapped in my house. And what a better way to waste time than by drawing.</p>

<p>Mostly some experimental stuff especially with posing, hair and head shape. Of course, the thing that gets me frustrated most is body proportions and limbs. However, I&#39;m pretty happy with how these turned out.</p>
