If there is a &quot;genre&quot; of thing that could fit under the nerd label, Akiba will have a lot of something for you. Today (by date in the western hemisphere), we made our first pilgrimige to this magical land.</p>
<p>The day started at 5:45am, the sun blazing forth in bright fury. This is not natural nor is my waking up at this time. But, that&#39;s how it happened and we went with it. The first order of business was to silence the growl in our stomachs, and a trip to Denny&#39;s made quick work of that. Chris, being the more adventerous type, ordered a more Japanese course of fish, rice, miso soup, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D">natto</a>. My meal was mostly the same, only swapping the fish for bacon and a fried egg (I&#39;m not a big fish fan, you see). Jeff was the least adventerous, getting himself some French toast.</p>

<p>Somehow, I managed to not <em>die of boredom</em> from my overnight stay at San Francisco yesterday. Interestingly enough, I wasn&#39;t the only person with the genius idea to camp out. As I wandered through out the airport trying to make myself tired enough to be able to sleep anywhere, I saw a lot of people sleeping anywhere. Particularly, restaurant booths were very popular.</p>
<p>But, that all aside, we endured the 11 hour flight and are now in the land that provides me with my primary sources of entertainment, both in television and games. The flight itself was alright, with plenty of entertainment options and a fair amount of food, none of which was terrible.</p>
<p>Being in Japan feels both surreal and almost... normal. Obviously, despite cultural differences, Japan is just another first world country and, as such, has many of the same conventions as our Western world. Combined with the fact that we&#39;re just kind of nestled into their civilization instead of segregated out as part of a tour group or something, it almost just feels like we&#39;re integrating in, as it were.</p>
<p>Except we&#39;re very, very not Asian and everybody around us is. And I have no idea what to do in some situations, due to language barrier and intrinsic Japanese mannerisms. But, all should be good in Akihabara tomorrow, the otaku capital of the world. I expect to lose quite a lot of money...</p>
<p>Before I go on to pictures, I just want to tell a small story that amused me to no end. As we were checking into our hotel, the lady behind the counter was explaining various this: where the bathrooms and showers were, how to get in the back door if we came in after hours, but notably checking out. &quot;You must check out before 10am and to do that, just put your key in the cat box.&quot; as she pointed to a simple wooden box with a porcelain cat on it. I don&#39;t know why, but it tickled me. I think it was part her earnest delivery coupled with her accent and just... it was called the &quot;cat box&quot;. It was insanely cute.</p>
<p>But now, some pictures:</p>

<p>Our hotel room is really, really small. Basically, it&#39;s large enough for the two bunk beds and the TV in between. But, it&#39;s a bed and quite conveniently located to other stuff, so I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all for this update, stay tuned for more.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-curse-of-punctuality">The Curse of Punctuality</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 31, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I am currently sitting in the airport, sulking in a chair across from the very open and lively airline counter with which I would check in my stuff. Through this line I passed and was at the counter rejected because I was trying to check in too early. My flight doesn&#39;t leave for another nine hours, but I like to be early.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always liked to be early.</p>
<p>When I worked at Walmart, if I wasn&#39;t there fifteen minutes before my scheduled clock-in time, I felt late. For any class, appointment, or interview, if I wasn&#39;t fifteen to twenty minutes early, I felt late. Perhaps it&#39;s less that I feel like I was late when I arrived, but I always aimed to hit these early times.</p>
<p>Because you never know what could happen in between.</p>
<p>For example, say you&#39;re commuting to work from 40 miles away. There&#39;s a whole hell of a lot that can happen in between. Weather, car accidents, or perhaps a horny giraffe has died of high blood pressure and is now blocking several lanes of traffic. That extra time works as a great buffer for these kinds of occasions so you can still be, at the very least, on time. If there are no issues, then you&#39;re early and get credit for being punctual.</p>
<p>And certainly, the bullet point on one&#39;s reputation for punctuality is part of the issue at stake. It&#39;s an easy thing to attain on the ever looming &quot;annual review&quot;. A high mark there gives one yet more buffer room on something else - small lapses in product quality, perhaps...</p>
<p>But, outside of that (and more importantly as I realized on the train), it reduces doubt. I am here, planning a sleep over at the airport, because I don&#39;t want anything left to chance on this very big trip of mine. I get as much work done on my projects as soon as I can to make room for the things that got glossed over, the challenges that weren&#39;t foreseen, and any scope creep that may and will occur. I aim to do everything in my power so that if something goes wrong, I did everything I possibly could to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like insurance you get just for being a litte bit impatient, a little bit paranoid, and a little bit proactive.</p>
<p>Well, that killed, like... fifteen minutes...</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/a-trip-to-jolly-ole-japan">A Trip to Jolly Ole Japan</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 29, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>The &quot;weekly&quot; accountability report was one of those things that was supposed to help keep me in check in conforming to my goals for the year. It&#39;s hardly been weekly and it&#39;s hardly been keeping me on track (ask me how many times I&#39;ve ordered Papa John&#39;s in the last month. I dare you). But, there was one item on the list that&#39;s about to get scratched off and that is the trip to <em>Nihon</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve probably mentioned before, but this trip is something that my brothers and I have wanted to do for some time, borne out of our budding interest in Japanese animated wares. Anime, in a fashion, was sort of a gateway drug into all manner of Japanese things from games to language to culture to music. It seems only logical that from this fascination we should go and visit the source.</p>
<p>If you were to ask &quot;what are you going to do there?&quot;, the answer would be slightly awkward. You see, while there is a list of things we&#39;d like to do, there&#39;s no set plan, no schedule, no itinerary. This is probably a terrible way to visit a foreign country, let alone one for people who&#39;ve never left the States and also have only the most rudimentary knowledge of the native tongue. But, the idea is more one of exploration than anything else. So here are the main points we plan to hit:</p>
<h2 id="akihabara">Akihabara</h2>
<p>The mecca for all things otaku, we&#39;ll probably spend a goodly amount of time here. This is probably where most of my money will be dropped on swag, arcades, and god knows what else. There are also plans of hitting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_cafe">maid cafe</a> while there, where my brother Chris and I can admire the local selection of females while being entirely awkward around them.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>Obviously, food is a huge fuckin&#39; deal over there, and a huge fuckin&#39; amount different than over here. Now, I myself am not a seafood fan, but on this occasion I&#39;m going to make some exceptions. I&#39;ll try fish, I&#39;ll have one of my brothers film it in case the result is funny. We&#39;re already preparing for a bit called &quot;Chris will eat it&quot; wherein Chris will eat things that are.... unusual. Here&#39;s the &quot;official&quot; list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takoyaki</li>
<li>Dancing squid</li>
<li>Sea-horse on a stick</li>
<li>Something with jellyfish</li>
<li>Taiyaki</li>
<li>Nikuman</li>
<li>Sushi</li>
<li>Tamago on a stick</li>
<li>Honest to god ramen stall</li>
<li>&quot;Family&quot; restaurant (or Denny&#39;s)</li>
<li>Korean Barbecue</li>
<li>KFC</li>
<li>Kitkats</li>
<li>Pepsi</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cultural-touristy-things">Cultural/Touristy Things</h2>
<p>Of course, we need to hit some more mainstream items as well. On the list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuckin&#39; Sky Tree</li>
<li>Rainbow Bridge</li>
<li>Tokyo Big Sight</li>
<li>Ueno Park</li>
<li>A shrine</li>
<li>A castle</li>
<li>7-Eleven</li>
<li>Karaoke</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, more or less, the list we&#39;ve been cultivating for the last several months and it&#39;ll be interesting to see what we hit, what we don&#39;t, and what we see that wasn&#39;t expected. Also, I plan on firing up the month of solid blogging again come June 1 (which means a blog post every day we&#39;re over there), so stay tuned for some fun stuff to come!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/a-californian-genesis">A Californian Genesis</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 22, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>In lieu of the weekly accountability report, I shall begin documenting the events that came about to land me where I am today (for posterity and stuff). Following that, I will also document my thoughts and adventures on living in the famous Bay Area (lots of pictures &#39;n shit).</p>
<p>The ball that got this whole thing rolling was a simple email I received somewhere in mid-January. It was from a recruiter who thought that my skills might match a position they had open. Now, I&#39;ve gotten several of these every month for the last couple years, to which I generally politely decline and proceed with my life (except that one time where I accepted and went to Winnercomm). The difference here was that this email was from LinkedIn and the job was also at LinkedIn, something far more awesome and legit than a random offer Kazhim. I immediately consulted one of my coworkers whom I shall refer to as &quot;Kairu&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>me:</strong> Just got a job &quot;feeler&quot; to work for Linkedin
<strong>Kairu:</strong> to work for linkedin?
<strong>me:</strong> for
<strong>Kairu:</strong> damn son
<strong>Kairu:</strong> damn
<strong>me:</strong> yeah...
<strong>Kairu:</strong> welp, see ya later
<strong>Kairu:</strong> where is it?
<strong>me:</strong> Mountain View
<strong>me:</strong> CA&#39;
<strong>Kairu:</strong> col?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> ah
<strong>Kairu:</strong> figured
<strong>me:</strong> sme as google, iirc
<strong>me:</strong> *same
<strong>Kairu:</strong> going for an interview?
<strong>me:</strong> I... I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t expecting this
<strong>Kairu:</strong> what did they say?
<strong>me:</strong> I suspect it&#39;s a mass mailing, but still
<strong>me:</strong> I forwarded it to you
<strong>Kairu:</strong> Gondor has called for aid
<strong>Kairu:</strong> Will you answer it?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> It is indeed a mass mailing, but i would still respond. you never know what is down that path, and personally, i think you should check it out
<em>--- time passes ---</em>
<strong>Kairu:</strong> why arent you on the phone right now
<strong>me:</strong> because I&#39;m working?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> well you aint working on getting a massive fucking promotion
<strong>me:</strong> ...
<strong>Kairu:</strong> :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As can be seen, I wasn&#39;t exactly leaping for joy. My feelings at the time were more that a huge fucking train had just rammed itself through the quiet temple that was my life. I honestly considered just ignoring the email entirely or declining as was my norm. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that nothing would come of anything and (with some egging from Kairu), I responded with interest in the position.</p>
<p>With that response, the waves of interviews began. I had an initial phone interview with the recruiter just talking about the position and LinkedIn and to ensure I was interested. After that was a simple technical phone screen, where a room of devs questioned me on various basic web dev topics. I thought I had failed at that point because I had trouble understanding the devs, due in part to them being on speaker, thick accents, and me being in the lobby of a busy building on my cell phone. I kept asking them to repeat and felt that my answers somehow came up short.</p>
<p>But, that wasn&#39;t the end (obviously). A few days later, I had a phone session where I talked to a couple of devs and they watched me write code via an online collaborative text editor. I felt a whole lot more confident about this interview than the previous one because I was at home on the phone with ear buds (these make me more awesome at phoning in general, not sure why) and also had a code editor in front of me. I don&#39;t rely on autocomplete for coding, but I have an easier time visualizing things when I can type it. Two of these types of interviews I did (back to back) and I again waited for a response.</p>
<p>And their response was &quot;we&#39;re going to fly you out for more interviews&quot;. Obviously, this is a big step because the cost of booking a flight, hotel, and car is not cheap (to me, at least) and if they were going to do that, they were serious. All I could think of, though, was my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">interview with Digg back in 2009</a> and how horrible that went and how green I was compared to everybody else. With that in my mind, I kept waiting for the details of flight information, but it was not forthcoming. I worried that perhaps _I_ was supposed to set everything up (as I had at Digg), but as it turned out an email slipped through the cracks. I called to make sure everything was still on (the day before I needed to fly out) and it was all taken care of over the phone. Because of the last minute-ness of booking, I even got an extra evening in Mountain View.</p>
<p>The flight itself was more or less uneventful. This time I had an evening before hand to prepare and, more importantly, shower. I had a car, so I wasn&#39;t going to have to ask strangers to direct me and make a trek in the hot sun in my interview clothes. I even dressed &quot;down&quot; a bit for the interview itself, wearing jeans, a button down, and a jacket. I&#39;d been around the block enough times at this point that I felt pretty confident in how &quot;loose&quot; I would be able to present myself, both in appearance and tone. I was feeling nervous, as I am any time I meet people for the first time, but I was mostly confident about the interview itself.</p>
<p>And sure enough, things went very, very well. I had four or five interviews where I was asked code certain things on the wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor whiteboards. It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d be fun, but I really enjoyed taking everything &quot;back to basics&quot; as it were. Everybody I interviewed with was very friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy working for the company, which is a good impression to leave on one who may be employed there. I lunched with some of my interviewers at the company cafeteria (they had pizza that day) and we shot the shit about all manner of things. Honestly, nearly all of my apprehension was gone within the first five minutes of the first interview and I must say that I even enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>My entire day of interviewing lasted about six hours total and, since I had the entire evening free, I had asked the last person I interviewed with (who is now my boss boss) what I might do to kill the remainder of my day. He suggested a bar called 21st Amendment in San Francisco. And go to that bar I did and it was delicious. (Never thought bleu cheese would work on a hamburger.) It was a great way to cap off the day.</p>
<p>Even being there only two days, it was kind of sad to return home as I had caught the glimmer of what my life might become. But, that&#39;s how that goes and I just had to await their final decision. Now, even though I felt all of my interviews had gone well, I was split 50/50 on whether the job would actually be offered to me. So, when the recruiter emailed and said she&#39;d like to talk, I became even more apprehensive.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, I was offered the job and even though I was pretty certain I was going to take it (especially after she had listed off compensation and the benefits package), I slept on it for a weekend. Maybe it was just to make peace with myself and the situation, maybe it was to give the outward impression that I was doing to responsible thing and carefully considering the journey upon which I was about to embark. I dunno.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it&#39;s all kind of crazy. I entered 2013 with the idea that nothing new or momentous was going to happen, maybe some more dating but really just living life on cruise control.</p>
<p>A single email changed all of that.</p>
