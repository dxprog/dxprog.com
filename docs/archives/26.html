I get to watch the Price is Right in the morning and Let&#39;s Make a Deal in the afternoon. Both shows are highly similar in format and hosted by Whose Line veterans, but Deal seems to be where all the weirdos go what with all their costumes and what such.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I managed to stick to my guns and purchased nothing extraneous last week. Food and gas were the only items money was shelled out for. I&#39;m going to duplicate that trend this week.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I did some walking almost every day last week and crammed in nearly ten miles of it yesterday. I feel my overall calorie intake was lower than usual as well. Also, I mention it every time I write this, but still doing well on keeping away from McD&#39;s and TBell. I note this because I was eating there for late night snacks three to four times a week in the later months of last year. That I haven&#39;t been to either place in nearly two months is kind of a big deal. I&#39;m not even craving them anymore which is more surprising. This is certainly a boon to my overall health and indeed my pocket book.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I haven&#39;t been studying, that much I can say. I do keep myself immersed in small ways, though, by reading kana that I come across. I even had a brief all Japanese conversation with my brother last week. This week I will do at the very least thirty minutes of studying every day, an hour preferable. That I have a basic grasp of the language is more crucial now that the trip to Japan is set in stone.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Seriously, I&#39;m just going to drop this one. There are too many other things that I rank higher in importance (that have money invested in them) over improving my art skills.</p>
<p>I think I just saw Danielle Fishel on the Price is Right...</p>

<p>I think John Hughes films may have been the conversation that sparked my <a href="http://whatshouldmattwatch.com">movie watch list</a>, so it&#39;s only fitting that I start at the beginning. That and the library just happened to have it on the particular day I strolled in. On blu-ray, even.</p>
<p>For those who may have been like me and have no clue what this movie is about, it&#39;s about a certain Samantha Baker and her sixteenth birthday. Or, rather, how everybody forgets it&#39;s her sixteenth birthday, primarily because it also happens to be the eve of her air-headed sister&#39;s birthday. The first act of the movie is essentially a slice-of-life type bit about Sam as she mopes about in adolescence. She&#39;s not popular in school, is overly conscious of her &quot;under development&quot;, and crushes on a guy that doesn&#39;t even know she exists, a certain Jake Ryan. Thanks to her interactions with the male protagonist - credited as &quot;The Geek&quot; but also referred to as &quot;Farmer Ted&quot; - she eventually makes it into the heart of Jake while &quot;Ted&quot; gets Jake&#39;s previous girlfriend. Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KezvwARhBIc">Kuni</a> shows up and is generally awesome.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m going to rant about a few things, but I want to make it clear that Sixteen Candles is a good movie and one that I definitely enjoyed. It&#39;s a heart-warming little flick with good characters, good humor, and a bit of drama. All the actors convey believable performances and, despite it obviously being set in the 80s, the movie carries an almost timeless feel to it. The themes here are universal even if the outcome is not.</p>
<p>Now to some musing. Thar be spoilers ahead.

You&#39;ve probably heard all about it already. The first movie for me to watch off this list was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo_With_A_Shotgun">Hobo with a Shotgun</a>, suggested by my French buddy Mickael.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O96vm9J.jpg" alt="" title="Hobo with a Shotgun"></p>
<p>Our film starts out with the titular Hobo - who never actually receives a name - rolling into a town presumably in Canada. The opening music is chipper, the sky is a highly saturated blue, and life in general seems to be just swell. Three minutes later, some dude has shoved down a manhole, a rope tossed around his neck, and a truck yanking his head off. It rains blood and some random chick in a bikini dances in it. This pretty much sets the tone for the remainder of the film until until our Hobo friend gets sick and tired of the wanton killing that seems to plague the town. He buys himself a shotgun and becomes the hero that Namelessville deserves. Oh, and he also befriends a stripper along the way.</p>
<p>Hobo with a Shotgun is pretty much everything I anticipated it would be; campy, cheesy, and violent for the sake of violence. There&#39;s no message, no point, just an excuse to watch people get their hands shoved into the whirling blade of a lawn mower. Which actually leads me to a musing. Along the way, Mr. Hobo gets letters carved into his chest with a knife, beat up, and stomped repeatedly by a dude wearing ice skates. But does that keep our intrepid protagonist down? No, not really, no. Give him a night of sleep and he&#39;s back up like nothing happened. Even his stripper companion nearly gets her head <em>sawed off</em>, but a couple hours in the ER and all is right again. Dialogue is equally cheesy, culminating in a scene where the Hobo is addressing babies in a hospital nursery about the bleak future and that, with any luck, they won&#39;t become a hobo with a shotgun like him.</p>
<p>The visual effects are relatively decent, I guess. I mean, once you&#39;ve seen one movie with tons of blood and gore, you&#39;ve seen most of them. Nothing too new or interesting here. Every scene seems to be hyper saturated, creating many shots that look almost mono- or dual-chromatic. Example on that last point, the finale is lit with a cyan light on one half and an orange on the other. After the extreme color correction, the effect is kind of nifty.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a pretty stupid movie. Everything was over the top and an obvious homage to the exploitation films of yore. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it to anybody unless they get a kick out of mindless violence.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong> - 2.5/5</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention the part where one of the baddies burns a bus full of kids with Disco Inferno playing in the background. Nothing more need be said.</p>

<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I spent the most money I&#39;ve ever spent this week. More on that in a moment. I have purchased all the Japanese items I shall for the month ($25 worth of light novels and manga). Bought some new shoes because every pair I had were quite literally falling apart at the seems. Also did a small Saturday project wherein I resurfaced my table... and the cleaning supplies I needed to clean said mess. This week I aim to buy nothing other than food needed to survive and gasoline if need be.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Still haven&#39;t been to either McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell, so good on that front. Only went to a couple restaurants this week, though Friday&#39;s escapades were donuts and cheese steaks, so take it as you will. Really have fallen off the walking wagon and I need to be working harder at that (can&#39;t let Mr. Helton take the top spot all the time). Yesterday, while walking to Walmart to acquire a sander, I forgot my fitbit half way there and had to turn around and try again. So my step count isn&#39;t 100% accuratly reflected.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing and Japanese</strong> - Nothing to report.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - The tickets have been purchased and we&#39;re set to go the first week of June. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PyQbAA0BFs5QIqFVZ7t9rmRTyDF2qcqoa7qa4AHPVQQ/edit">We&#39;re currently penning a document of stuff we&#39;d like to do</a>. This is happening.</p>
<p>For real, dog.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/accountability-report-week-5">Accountability Report - Week 5</a></h1><time class="post__published">February 3, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><strong>Finances</strong> - Resisting the urge to buy something when you know you can <em>afford</em> but don&#39;t actually <em>need</em> it is quite frustrating. However, I have done well on resisting the urge for the most part. I did line up a couple things for pre-order and have settled on the number of $50/mo to satisfy my urge to purchase Japanese items. Also, unbeknownst to me, Amazon decided that they would charge me for Prime without notice once my trial had ended. Now I have Prime. Generally when it comes to online ordering, I trade patience for money and go with the cheapest shipping option, but I guess that&#39;s moot now. Also, I&#39;ll probably be purchasing from Amazon instead of rightstuf just so I can somewhat justify the money they have taken from me. I did do some spontaneous &quot;gifting&quot; of things last week, which was some money gone not planned. That shouldn&#39;t, however, become anything regular.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Lackluster week on the exercise front. I did not get out for the usual afternoon walks as often as I should have which also caused Mr. Helton to pull ahead of me in steps. I&#39;m putting my foot down on that this week (get it?). I&#39;ve still managed to stay away from most fast food, a trip to Cici&#39;s with my family notwithstanding. Interestingly, I haven&#39;t even had the urge for the late night McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell trip. Or even to go there at all. I&#39;ve done my best to have <em>something</em> hanging around the house for when those urges occur, usually in the form of some kind of sandwich. Or delicious bread pudding. It&#39;s not good for me, but at least it&#39;s not processed, right?</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Not too much new here. I did get <a href="http://kanacards.us">Kanacards</a> to a (mostly) usable state and have been doing vocab drills with that. There&#39;s still some development to go to make it full featured and sand down the rough edges, but it can and shall be used. The most difficult thing I&#39;m finding, however, is that my Genki book is a text book but there&#39;s no syllabus to go with it. So, I&#39;m trudging along as best I can.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I hooked my Wacom back up to my computer at some point this week.</p>
