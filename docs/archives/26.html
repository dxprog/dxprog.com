On the upside, I get to have a longer birthday than usual. On the downside, I&#39;m leaving Japan. I looking forward to being back in the States, though. It&#39;ll be nice to be able to go into places and understand the language and also to have Taco Bell and pizza. I&#39;ll leave you with a stupid ass video taken in our hotel room on some evening I don&#39;t remember. Sayounara!</p>

<p>Yes, those are <em>ahem</em> protrusions in an aptly placed spot. They&#39;re made of the same material you&#39;d find in a keyboard/mouse wrist rest (yes, I touched it). My brother was quite taken by the material (he claims just the material).</p>
<p>Writing up enormously long posts is quite cumbersome on this laptop and are also so schizophrenic that it detracts from the awesomeness of individual locations visited. Thus, I will be penning shorter yet more informational articles when we return to the states, sometime &quot;tomorrow&quot; (or the day after tomorrow in American time). Look forward to it!</p>

We&#39;re heading out early for more sightseeing, I&#39;ve slept in late (6:45 am), so all you get today is a video of Chris and I bashing out some Taiko goodness at the SEGA arcade in Akihabara (who gracefully didn&#39;t have any photography bans that I could see). Ja ne~!</p>

<p>Our &quot;plan&quot; for this trip has been somewhat haphazard; nothing concrete but some bullet points. The rest is left to fate. I think yesterday&#39;s excursions proved just how well this methodology can work. We&#39;ve hit upon a little pattern to our madness: Akihabara every other day and touristy, sight seeing in between. Yesterday fell very much in the latter bucket.

If there is a &quot;genre&quot; of thing that could fit under the nerd label, Akiba will have a lot of something for you. Today (by date in the western hemisphere), we made our first pilgrimige to this magical land.</p>
<p>The day started at 5:45am, the sun blazing forth in bright fury. This is not natural nor is my waking up at this time. But, that&#39;s how it happened and we went with it. The first order of business was to silence the growl in our stomachs, and a trip to Denny&#39;s made quick work of that. Chris, being the more adventerous type, ordered a more Japanese course of fish, rice, miso soup, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D">natto</a>. My meal was mostly the same, only swapping the fish for bacon and a fried egg (I&#39;m not a big fish fan, you see). Jeff was the least adventerous, getting himself some French toast.</p>
