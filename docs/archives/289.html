It&#39;s wonderful. Our room is almost double the size of what we had and the backyard is superb (we&#39;ve been out at least twice everyday since we moved last Wednesday). Of course, there&#39;s been a few problems but all have now been worked out.</p>
<p>Last night I e-mail Phil Vischer, creator of the popular kids show VeggieTales, inquiring about how he rigged the veggies. To my surprise, waiting in my inbox this afternoon was a personal reply:
[quote]Hey Matt,</p>
<p>When we produced the shows in Softimage, it was all lattice  deformation.  Each eye was in a lattice, and then the entire  character was in a lattice.  We just animated lattices.  The mouths  were simple texture maps created by a separate animation and applied  in rendering, and then reapplied slightly blurred as a bump map.   Very simple stuff.  (All developed in 1991 when I built Larry for the  first time.)</p>
<p>Virtually nothing changed until we moved to Maya in 2000.  By then I  was no longer animating, so I&#39;m not sure what they changed.  Now  everything is done in Canada, and I&#39;m clueless.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

Talk about cool :-D. With that knowledge I can now finish my models for MeatStories (R) ;-).</p>
<p>Also this afternoon I became the webmaster for a bunch of <a href="http://www.clearcreekmonks.org">monks</a>. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to call their &quot;outside guy&quot; to get a list of everything I need to do. I poked around their server a bit and it looks like I&#39;m going to have to do some ASP[.NET] work (which I&#39;d actually been tinkering with shortly before we moved), so that&#39;ll be fun (and bring back some memories).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for tonight. Now that my computer is setup again (with internet) I&#39;ll be making my usual every other day entry.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Prepare for a Revolution!</h2><time>September 19, 2005</time><div><p>It was certainly an exciting weekend for those of us paying attention to TGS (Tokyo Game Show). The new Nintendo Revolution controller was finally unveiled. At first I was kind of skeptical, I mean the thing is a freakin&#39; remote:

Part of me kind of died because I&#39;ve grown up holding a controller in two hands using super quick thumb reflexes to get myself around. However, the more I thought about the possibilities of the tilt sensors, the more I began to like it. One thing that I would love to see is a Star Wars lightsaber game. I was still kind of leery, but then I heard that there&#39;s a conventional controller that you can plug the remote into. Besides, I&#39;ll be able to play Tetris Attack, so I have to buy one whether I like the controller or note. Needless to say I really can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one of these and see how it works.</p>
<p>On the house front: A good 75-80% of the house is packed now. Mainly just the big things (furniture, appliances, computers, etc.) are left. Sometime tomorrow we&#39;ll be getting a dumpster and emptying the garage and packing the U-Haul. It&#39;s going to be a long, tiring week but it&#39;ll be well worth it.</p>
<p>As an interesting closer I post some things I&#39;ve unearthed (either through packing or cleaning up my computer):
