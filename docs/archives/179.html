Hard to believe it&#39;s already been half a year. Time does fly when you&#39;re having fun. But that&#39;s hardly why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>For MGR, our final project was to create a magazine layout and thirty second animation for a product, service, etc. I had a few ideas for mine before settling on something that was close to me: Crayola crayons. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve never really touched much on my artistic background, but I&#39;ve always had a box of Crayons crayons handy. I can remember buying crayons with my birthday money (it was the only time I ever had any) many times. Also, whenever we&#39;d take a trip to visit my grandparents I&#39;d always be drawing stuff with a bowl of crayons that my Grandma would set out. Even now, sitting next to me on my desk is a box of 64 Crayolas, and they&#39;re not unused either. And, for the record, those other brands aren&#39;t really crayons. Crayola&#39;s have a distinct smell, texture, and feel that has not been duplicated by anybody else. I don&#39;t mind spending a little extra for them. Upon opening the box and getting a whiff, I am suddenly a little kid, lying on the floor doodling and day dreaming away as only the innocent can.</p>
<p>But, enough of the schmaltzy stuff. Before you can watch the video you must see the ad. It kind of sets the mood.</p>

<p>And, now, for the coup de gracie. Enjoy!</p>

<p>As of the beginning of this month I began my foray into the wondrous world that is motion graphics. Our first project was to make a ten second bumper advertising ourselves or a &quot;company&quot; that represented ourselves. I was originally going to use my name and try to brand myself as myself, but it was advised by an instructor that I brand myself under a pseudonym, at least for the remainder of school, so as to have something that gives a lasting impression. I decided to play off of my more or less established internet moniker, dxprog, and came up with dx productions. Grab yourself some popcorn and prepare to be sold my awesomeness.</p>
