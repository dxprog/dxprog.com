not a creature was stirring except for the dudeon his laptop.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t rhyme, but I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m sitting here in our new living room lit up tree in front of me and a fireplace full of stockings to my right (picture coming soon). Now this in and of itself is a nice feeling but having my laptop and posting here while doing it makes the feeling cooler ;-). But anyhoo...</p>
<p>Christmas <em>is</em> is coming and we&#39;ve been doing all the usual: making cookies, listening to Christmas music (even while I&#39;m at work :-D), buying gifts, etc. I&#39;d say that we&#39;re pretty much ready. The only bad thing is that Dad found the key to the freezer and I must go cookieless until Christmas Eve :-(.</p>
<p>Things in layaway have slowed down considerably. Thursday and Friday were a nightmare but since I couold count on my hands and toes how many people have come through to get stuff. Sunday night I began learning the how to operate the register and I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t want to do that (for reasons I don&#39;t want to go into again :-P). On Monday I&#39;ll be discussing my future at Wal-Mart with a manager and depending on if there&#39;s any other spots open or not I&#39;ll either be a cashier or a cart pusher. If I could do cashiering back in electronics I&#39;d probably leap on it, otherwise I&#39;ll probably push carts (unless overnight socker is available). But anyways, it looks like I&#39;m not even going to get laid off before coming back (I must have made a good impression).</p>
<p>But now I must go and make another attempt at finding the freezer key (or something :-P). Merry Christmas :-D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>LAPTOP!! WHOOOO!!</h2><time>December 15, 2005</time><div><p>Ah.... I sit in the living room in a nice comfy chair as I write this. Yes.. I got my laptop out this morning. I stayed up all night to do it, but I did it and DANGif it isn&#39;t a darn nice feeling :-). I&#39;ve got a bunch of junk I&#39;m going to need to uninstall (currently there are 14 icons down on the system tray :-P). But at least I&#39;ve got a processor/RAM combo that can handle a bunch of stuff :-D.</p>
<p>This is a bittersweet feeling, though, because today is the day that all Christmas layaway&#39;s are due out. It&#39;s probably going to be a hellacious afternoon/evening but at least I&#39;ll have something nice to come to tonight :-). That said, though, it may not be so bad because we&#39;ve got an orderly system in place. From what I understand I&#39;ll come in, pick up a car with somebody&#39;s layaway, get it and bring it in. That is a far cry from going to to get 5+ layaway&#39;s at a time :-P.</p>
<p>But, now I must fiddle with junk. BABEE! :-D</p>
