I haven&#39;t really put it out anywhere, but I&#39;ve had a <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> account for some time now. Like, almost a year. I put up some of my Matt (Digital Double) redesigns and promptly forgot about it. Well, since I&#39;ve been drawing all this stuff lately I&#39;ve been posting again and garnering some attention. Attention like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Dude, you don&#39;t have enough pageviews for the time you&#39;ve been to DA and the quality of your stuff. I&#39;ve only been here for a few weeks and I have more than triple your pageviews, it&#39;s annoying. Do more art! I less than three your style. = P&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s like a kick to the balls and at the same time it&#39;s nice. He obviously thinks highly of my artwork, but the whole &quot;d00d! I&#39;m teh n00b and teh p0puler and you teh arnt&quot; hurts slightly. He (I assume it&#39;s a guy) does have a point that I need to more art. One thing that baffles me, though, is that last sentence. The world may never know...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Art du Kick Ass</h2><time>May 21, 2007</time><div><p>I decided to switch gears and move away from the Final Fantasy XII fan art. This time I&#39;m doin&#39; Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the <strong>best</strong> artwork I&#39;ve ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are <strong>FIVE</strong> fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn&#39;t entirely faithful to the <a href="http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg">source material</a>, but I&#39;m really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin&#39; awesome.</p>
