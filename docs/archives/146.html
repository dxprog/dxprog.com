I am currently at Orlando International where I await the departure of my flight at 6:23am, a little less than six hours from now. I was hoping to walk in here, dump off my luggage, and get through security right off the bat. However, good old Northwest Airlines has, yet again, left me with an unmanned counter. So, I am stuck with my twenty pound bag of clothing and vigilantly watching for the first signs of life at the counter.

Once again I have finished another two courses at Full Sail. This time was Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Math (CMD) which was basically an Algebra course.

DAT was alright; it was essentially a traditional art course with design centric properties. Not being able to use my computer was difficult for me especially because pencils and paper don't have the Ctl+Z option. If you screw up, you've screwed up. Congratulations. However, I did pump out some decent stuff which I will show to you now.

This is my fice piece still life. I pushed it a little bit by counting the drum sticks as seperate objects, but meh. It went ungraded anyways (as did most things in that class).

This is the only piece I am truly proud of. I don't really have much to say aside from it was painted with acrylics on canvas and it was my first time doing any painting outside of using Crayola watercolors. The colors are a little dark because mixing paints is a bitch.

I did do several other pieces, but I don't have pictures of them and seeing as I'm at the airport I won't be taking pictures anytime soon.

Nothing really to report on about math because that's exactly what it was. What is sweet, though, is that I may pull an A out of that class which would thrill me to no end as I thought math was my suckiest subject.

So, there's my month on a nutshell. I'll probably post again once I'm in ol' Bartlesville. Until then, keep on peacin' out!</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/so-many-all-nighters">So many all nighters</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 22, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It&#39;s true; I have pulled an insane amount of all nighters this year and here I am doing it once again.

So, yes, here is the new design. It's not the same one I was working on [back in October](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/redesign-the-reason/). No, it's better. I was actually going to use this for my final project in Fabian's class (NOS), but he borked his server and essentially axed the entire set up a blog requirement. I do owe him a lot for this design as it was his, shall we say, technique that inspired me. Design aside, this is the easiest transition to new design/engine I've ever had (thanks in no small part to the fact that I reused the current database structure).

That's all I'm going to blog right now. I'm going to be returning to good old Bartlesville for Christmas in a few days. Perhaps I'll write something then. In case I don't say it in time, I hope everybody has a Kick Ass Christmas!

P.S. Yeah, I added tagging. Maybe I'll add a tag cloud later.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/wecome-to-relaunch-5-0">Welcome to Relaunch 5.0!</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 20, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Not sure if that version number is correct or not, but it seems about right.</p>

I've been noticing lately that the database has been having trouble keeping up with the higher demand so that is why I rushed this out the door. Overall things are much faster, however, information is only pulled from the database once an hour so there's going to be a delay between, say, somebody adding a comment and it actually showing up on the page. This bug will not plague the next iteration which is set to roll out within the next two weeks.</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/147.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/145.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
