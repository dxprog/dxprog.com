<p>Here we are at day three and already I&#39;m forced to talk about the death of things dear to me. No, not Andy Griffith (though, I did see my fair share of him when my dad went through his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series">Matlock</a>) phase in the early 90s).</p>
<p>For over half a decade, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> has been the sight that has greeted me as I started my browser and many times when I clicked the &quot;home&quot; button of my browser (a button I&#39;ve had to explicitly enable in Chrome). But soon, this will be <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html">no more</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;d had a hunch that iGoogle was getting less than stellar treatment lately as it became very difficult to make iGoogle my default page for google.com and also when its design was broken through their extensive redesigning. Perhaps the personal web portal is passe at this point, but I will surely miss it. iGoogle has provided me with an at-a-glance preview of my mail and a handful of other website snippets since its inception in 2005.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&#39;ve been using less and less of the gadgets (or whatever they call them), slowly being culled down from my email and RSS feeds from various websites and webcomics to just mail, a deviantArt gadget that I don&#39;t pay attention to anymore, and the RSS feed from my <a href="http://www.square-headed.com/">brother&#39;s comic</a>. Outside of the casual overview of my email, I don&#39;t really take advantage of functionality of iGoogle anymore as I&#39;ve moved away to better, dedicated applications and sites such as <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and the ever present <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, I&#39;m a programmer, dammit! I can build myself a site that not only provides the same functionality I used before, but make it better, faster, stronger, and more tailored to my needs! I have sixteen months to replace the death row inmate that is iGoogle and replace it I shall.</p>
<p>I shall...</p>

<p>Some time ago, I came to the realization that I could (for free) check out movies from the local library. As convenience would have it, the library is about half a mile from my place of work, so it provides an excellent reason to get in some exercise during my lunch break.</p>
<p>Last week - on one of these very journeys - I was perusing the blu-ray section and ran across a couple of films. One I&#39;d seen, the other not: <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>  and <em>Blade Runner</em> respectively. Now, I shouldn&#39;t have to remind you of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/2000wtf/">feelings for <em>2001</em></a>, but I thought perhaps my six years of maturation since having watched it initially may have changed things. <em>Blade Runner</em> I picked up partially based on glowing reviews from a coworker, partially because I felt I was going to need some badass 80s action movie to pick me up after rewatching <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>Well, I fucked that one up.</p>
<p><em>2001</em> was watched first and, for the most part, my feelings towards the movie are mostly the same; it&#39;s slow, it doesn&#39;t make much sense, but the special effects are quite incredible for the time. About half way through the movie, I threw up my arms in defeat and got wasted. Inebriation didn&#39;t help much my enjoyment of the movie nor did it provide any epiphanies (I suspect that only getting stoned is going to help you there). But, that was okay. I knew going in about what to expect and I still had some Harrison Ford awesomeness to look forward to.</p>
<p>Only I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Because, in many ways, <em>2001</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> are very similar movies: they&#39;re both slow, they both don&#39;t make much sense, and they both have very good effects for their time. I went into <em>Blade Runner</em> expecting an action flick starring one of the best action stars of all time - something akin to Die Hard - but, instead I got a noir film set in a dystopian future that focuses on android&#39;s rights. Not what I was expecting at all.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t lie - and keeping in mind what I was expecting - I did not very much enjoy <em>Blade Runner</em>. Firstly, I&#39;m not entirely partial to dark films (both figuratively and literally in this case) and I&#39;ll give <em>2001</em> props for at least being a hopeful movie. Secondly, the soundtrack for <em>Blade Runner</em> is so 80s psychedelic that it almost made me feel like I was tripping balls despite the fact that I was entirely sober for that film. <em>2001</em>, on the other hand, uses nothing but classical music for its score, so point again. Finally, <em>Blade Runner</em>&#39;s basic premise of &quot;what are the rights of a manufactured life form&quot; has been done <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor">time</a> and <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">again</a>. Also, while I did say it didn&#39;t make much sense, <em>Blade Runner</em> was at least a bit easier to piece together than <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say this, I have to say that I enjoyed <em>2001</em> much more than <em>Blade Runner</em>. I don&#39;t necessarily hate <em>Blade Runner</em>, but it&#39;s just not a movie suited to my tastes.</p>

Seeing how this blog is currently collecting figurative dust, I feel like I should try this again. Some days shall be easier than others as the <a href="http://tokyointulsa.com/">anime convention</a> happens this month. Additionally, I shall be taking a trip to Dallas with my dad and brothers to partake in the excitingness that is Six Flags over Texas. I quite enjoy the thrill of rollar coasters, I do.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m a bit drunk at the moment and the room is quite spinning, so this blog shall have to remain as it is, but expect there to be <em>something</em> on the face of this blog every day for the month of July. I will leave off with the first thing that came up for a google image search of &quot;drunk&quot;.</p>

<p>As stated before, I don&#39;t recall exactly when I learned to read; there is just the period of my life before literacy and the period after. I must&#39;ve learned it while I was still going to school, but the details escape me. I remember reading stuff while there, but not what was read save for one thing: the Boxcar Children. It was read during class at some point and, while I wasn&#39;t necessarily enthralled during that time, I remembered enough to make attack a mountain of Boxcar Children books that were given to us by my Scholastic employed Godmother. I don&#39;t know how many of those things I read, but it was quite a lot. How a series goes from being a one-off tale about orphans living in a box car and finding family to various tales of adventure and mystery is beyond me. I suspect these were all pretty shitty books. Even then, I was never able to finish the second one despite numerous attempts to do so. Not sure why...</p>
<p>Another series that I read a fair amount of in my younger years was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a>. I don&#39;t think there are very many children of the 90s who <em>didn&#39;t</em> read Goosebumps. Again, I don&#39;t recall much about these save for two things: they scared the shit out of me and Say Cheese and Die was awesome. Actually, thinking back on the story, it&#39;s a little like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_note">Death Note</a>, only the Note in this case is a camera and the bearer doesn&#39;t actually intend for people to die. I think maybe I should read that book again...</p>
<p>There were other books and series in there: the Hardy Boys, Lord of the Rings, the Belgariad and its sequel, and various classics in the form of <a href="http://www.seriesbooks.com/cart/catalog.aspx?cid=222">Moby Books</a> amoungst others. But there&#39;s one fictional universe in particular that has shaped my life in more ways than I could possibly imagine, from the sheer amount of time spent reading to actual changes in my behaviour. I am, of course, talking about Star Wars.</p>
<p>To date, I have read no less than 78 Star Wars books (yes, I&#39;ve counted), ranging from the first, small novels by Alan Dean Foster up to the New Jedi Order series and its whopping nineteen novels. I don&#39;t know exactly what my first Star Wars book was, but I&#39;m inclined to say it was probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Jedi_Knights_Series">Junior Jedi Knights</a> book <em>The Golden Globe</em> which I read when I was twelve. I didn&#39;t spend too long in that series initially and quickly &quot;graduated&quot; to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Jedi_Knights">Young Jedi Knights</a>. Finally eschewing the children&#39;s series, I went on to read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jedi_Academy_trilogy">Jedi Academy trilogy</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Wing_Series">X-wing series</a>, and of course, the phenomenal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrawn_trilogy">Thrawn trilogy</a>. To this day, the Thrawn trilogy is probably my favorite series of books and its author, Timothy Zahn, also amoungst my favorites.</p>
<p>At my peak, I was reading at the pace of a Star Wars novel a day, sometimes blowing through three or four a week. Star Wars literature - and the universe that it created in my mind - engrossed me for probably a good six or seven years of my life. I cannot think any other single thing in my life that so consumed me. All good things must come to an end, however, and once I completed the New Jedi Order series, my Star Wars mania was spent. The last time I picked up a Star Wars book was in late &#39;08 as I waited overnight for a bus at the Orlando airport. But, I do not regret for a minute the time that I spent behind the pages of these books. I actually attribute a lot of my English skills - from spoken to written - to these books. I know for a fact that it was in a Star Wars novel that I first encountered the word &quot;ricochet&quot;, the phrases &quot;oft used&quot; and &quot;delusions of granduer&quot;, and how I began the use of the term &quot;blast&quot; in swearing (something one of my former bosses thought was &quot;cute&quot;).</p>
<p>After my Star Wars days, my reading of fiction dropped to almost nothing for the longest time; partially because I began working, partially due to the internet and site like Slashdot and Digg which provided articles relevant to my interests. I wouldn&#39;t become heavily invested in reading again until mid 2009 as a new genre caught my attention...</p>
