So, tonight I&#39;ll just repost this comment I left on reddit some days ago (because that&#39;s what we do):</p>
<p>My moronic roommate had invited some person from his class to stay at our place. I already hated my roommate, but I was in my last few months of college and it meant paying less, so I agreed to it.
Few days later, he&#39;s helping move the new guy&#39;s stuff in when he waddles into my room (overweight) all red in the face and out of breath. He asked if I would help get a couch up the stairs (we were on the second floor of the apartment complex). I reluctantly agreed and went out to help.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, I must explain how the stairs were laid out in the complex. There were two sets of stairs up: one with a bend half way up and one that went straight up. Here&#39;s a handy diagram:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1XpZX.jpg" alt="" title="A Diagram"></p>
<p>Gradients are stairs, red arrows how one gets up them.</p>
<p>So I walk out and see that they&#39;re trying to take the couch up the set of stairs with the bend and they were stuck getting it around the last corner. This is idiotic in and of itself as they could&#39;ve taken the straight stairs up and encountered no issues. It was the system of ropes and winches that literally caused my jaw to drop as I stared in disbelief for nearly a minute. The couch was actually dangling above the ground, anchored from the stairs going to the third floor.</p>
<p>I did wind up helping them get around the corner and immediately retreated to my room still in disbelief.</p>

The specifics are a bit complex to go over here, but at its core, he wasn&#39;t mentally picture the structure of an array correctly and so was reading his array&#39;s wrong causing them to display as if they were rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really remember having any issues when dealing with arrays, though these days, I generally stick to single dimensional arrays and use math if I need to convert from, say, a screen coordinate to its corresponding spot in the data structure. Particularly, and in the case of our argument, we were talking about reading in a map file. That got me thinking about this trinket I wrote several years ago.</p>

<p>If I recall, this test was more about scripted AI and platform physics, but there was a loadable map aspect as well. Maps are something I&#39;ve played around with for a very long time, one of my first programming mental puzzles being how to generate one that wasn&#39;t gibberish programatically. This was something that baffled me for the longest time, but I eventually did figure something out and even wrote a <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/randmaps.html">tutorial about it</a>.</p>
<p>But, really, this whole little tale and code offering are because I had no idea what to talk about otherwise. I suspect I shall have less issues tomorrow (for reasons that will become clear), but that hardly helps me in the here and now.</p>

<p>Here we are at day three and already I&#39;m forced to talk about the death of things dear to me. No, not Andy Griffith (though, I did see my fair share of him when my dad went through his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series">Matlock</a>) phase in the early 90s).</p>
<p>For over half a decade, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> has been the sight that has greeted me as I started my browser and many times when I clicked the &quot;home&quot; button of my browser (a button I&#39;ve had to explicitly enable in Chrome). But soon, this will be <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html">no more</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;d had a hunch that iGoogle was getting less than stellar treatment lately as it became very difficult to make iGoogle my default page for google.com and also when its design was broken through their extensive redesigning. Perhaps the personal web portal is passe at this point, but I will surely miss it. iGoogle has provided me with an at-a-glance preview of my mail and a handful of other website snippets since its inception in 2005.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&#39;ve been using less and less of the gadgets (or whatever they call them), slowly being culled down from my email and RSS feeds from various websites and webcomics to just mail, a deviantArt gadget that I don&#39;t pay attention to anymore, and the RSS feed from my <a href="http://www.square-headed.com/">brother&#39;s comic</a>. Outside of the casual overview of my email, I don&#39;t really take advantage of functionality of iGoogle anymore as I&#39;ve moved away to better, dedicated applications and sites such as <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and the ever present <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, I&#39;m a programmer, dammit! I can build myself a site that not only provides the same functionality I used before, but make it better, faster, stronger, and more tailored to my needs! I have sixteen months to replace the death row inmate that is iGoogle and replace it I shall.</p>
<p>I shall...</p>

<p>Some time ago, I came to the realization that I could (for free) check out movies from the local library. As convenience would have it, the library is about half a mile from my place of work, so it provides an excellent reason to get in some exercise during my lunch break.</p>
<p>Last week - on one of these very journeys - I was perusing the blu-ray section and ran across a couple of films. One I&#39;d seen, the other not: <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>  and <em>Blade Runner</em> respectively. Now, I shouldn&#39;t have to remind you of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/2000wtf/">feelings for <em>2001</em></a>, but I thought perhaps my six years of maturation since having watched it initially may have changed things. <em>Blade Runner</em> I picked up partially based on glowing reviews from a coworker, partially because I felt I was going to need some badass 80s action movie to pick me up after rewatching <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>Well, I fucked that one up.</p>
<p><em>2001</em> was watched first and, for the most part, my feelings towards the movie are mostly the same; it&#39;s slow, it doesn&#39;t make much sense, but the special effects are quite incredible for the time. About half way through the movie, I threw up my arms in defeat and got wasted. Inebriation didn&#39;t help much my enjoyment of the movie nor did it provide any epiphanies (I suspect that only getting stoned is going to help you there). But, that was okay. I knew going in about what to expect and I still had some Harrison Ford awesomeness to look forward to.</p>
<p>Only I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Because, in many ways, <em>2001</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> are very similar movies: they&#39;re both slow, they both don&#39;t make much sense, and they both have very good effects for their time. I went into <em>Blade Runner</em> expecting an action flick starring one of the best action stars of all time - something akin to Die Hard - but, instead I got a noir film set in a dystopian future that focuses on android&#39;s rights. Not what I was expecting at all.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t lie - and keeping in mind what I was expecting - I did not very much enjoy <em>Blade Runner</em>. Firstly, I&#39;m not entirely partial to dark films (both figuratively and literally in this case) and I&#39;ll give <em>2001</em> props for at least being a hopeful movie. Secondly, the soundtrack for <em>Blade Runner</em> is so 80s psychedelic that it almost made me feel like I was tripping balls despite the fact that I was entirely sober for that film. <em>2001</em>, on the other hand, uses nothing but classical music for its score, so point again. Finally, <em>Blade Runner</em>&#39;s basic premise of &quot;what are the rights of a manufactured life form&quot; has been done <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor">time</a> and <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">again</a>. Also, while I did say it didn&#39;t make much sense, <em>Blade Runner</em> was at least a bit easier to piece together than <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say this, I have to say that I enjoyed <em>2001</em> much more than <em>Blade Runner</em>. I don&#39;t necessarily hate <em>Blade Runner</em>, but it&#39;s just not a movie suited to my tastes.</p>
