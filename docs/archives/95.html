I&#39;ll have that fixed in a day or two.</p>
<p>In the mean time I am recovering from a... ahem... computer problem. I shall just say this: don&#39;t go around deleting things unless you are absolutely, one hundred precent sure they don&#39;t have some sort of low-level hook into your system. And on top of that don&#39;t go stopping services unless you are completely certain you aren&#39;t going to need it. So, yeah.</p>
<p>That all said I won&#39;t be having a comic up today. I&#39;ll probably put something up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Okay, first of all I&#39;m really ticked at myself for spelling crystal wrong in the comic title. Oh, well, I&#39;m too lazy to change it now :-P.</p>
<p>The idea behind this is pretty self-explanitory. Oh, an Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is a darn fun game (not to mention probably the prettiest game I&#39;ve ever seen).</p>
<p>But that&#39;s about all I have to say about that.</p>

<p>What is this video that has garnered so much attention as to get myself on most favorited and highest ranked lists on YouTube? Well, that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1LBWwQeH0">&quot;Weird&quot; Al video</a> I posted a link to the other day. So, yeah, go watch it (27 times, now) and rate it some more and before you know it I&#39;ll be a billionaire!</p>

<p>Not much to say except: if you dare try to spam my site again, you&#39;d better be ready to pay the consequences!!</p>
<p>Title&#39;s a play off of &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, and don&#39;t forget to check out Weird Al&#39;s latest video: <a href="http://digg.com/videos_music/Weird_Al_s_Weasel_Stomping_Day_Video">Weasel Stomping Day</a>. (digg it too, because I know you are all nice people).</p>

<p>I have an incredibly sordid past. Sadly all of these (except the last one, of course) are true. This was during a time when good old GoldenPalace.com would seemingly buy just about anything. So I would track the stories of their purchases and true to stay one step ahead. Didn&#39;t really work. However, I will go into some detail behind each one.</p>
<p>The Common Cold - February of &#39;05, I believe it was, I had a nasty cold. Put me in bed for about a week. Shortly after I got better I decided to try and sell the common cold, one of the &quot;oldest human diseases of all time&quot;. I blew my nose into a tissue, stuffed into a zippy bag and made up a little &quot;facts sheet&quot;. I must&#39;ve still be delerious from that cold :-P.</p>
<p>The Darth Vader Pancake - I&#39;ve had a few people ask how I made the Vader &quot;face&quot; in the pancake. What I did was scratched the design into a piece of aluminum foil, layed that in the bottom of the pan and the parts of the batter that actually connected with the pan wound up darker leaving the Vader impression on the morsel. I believe it was like 2 or 3 in the morning when I did this. Sad to say nbody bought the pancake and I wound up eating it about a week or two after making it. It didn&#39;t really taste that good.</p>
<p>The John Paul II Photomosaic - I basically cover the story in the comic. However, it did take me two or three nights to glean all those religious pictures off of Google image search. Then I just ran everything through some fancy butt software and there it was. I thought I was going to be printing my own money. Not really. The picture sat on our mantle for a while before I reclaimed my frame and put my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/obi_subway.png">Obi-wan Eats at Subway</a> picture in it where it hangs on my wall even to this day.</p>
<p>I have sold other things on eBay (legit and not so much). One thing I attempted to sell was <a href="mailto:loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com">loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com</a>. This was shortly after that xbox 360 address snagged a gob of dough. But, anyhoo, I&#39;ve rambled long enough.</p>
