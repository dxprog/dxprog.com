<p>Bros came over this weekend, always good times to be had there. We&#39;ve been watching anime, aging games and doing tragic us amounts of asking. Probably five to six miles today alone. We visited the usual nerd places and hit up a thrift store I pursuit of cosplay items.</p>
<p>Speaking of costly, I&#39;ve gotten quite a bit farther on my costume and it&#39;s not looking terrible. The more I do is the easier it&#39;s becoming, so that&#39;s always encouraging. I would post a picture, but that would ruin the surprise or something.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been our using OkCupid again and realize why I kind of dropped it in e first ace: it&#39;s full of hyper Christians who also happen to be young, single moms. I don&#39;t mean to judge, but that seems a tad contradictory...</p>
<p>Tonight, my bros snood I are going to cool off at the pool and, as we wait for said pool to drain of people, I am sitting her writing a blog post. That brings us to now.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>In Pursuit of Deliciousness</h2><time>June 18, 2011</time><div><p>So, contrary to what one might believe, my at home eatings do not consist solely of hot pockets and ramen noodles (contrary to what my <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2011/06/matts-big-birthday-bash/">mother&#39;s blog</a> might lead you to believe). Being that I actually have culinary skills, I&#39;ve made some pretty bitchin&#39; things. There was the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-letter-to-my-dearest-mother">potato salad</a>, of course, but here are some other things that have graced my table and stomach.</p>

I used to make a lot of pancakes in college (with various extras) because they&#39;re <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/detail.aspx">freakin&#39; easy</a> and cheap. Remembering that, relived the experience my first week in the apartment. Also decided to toss in some eggs and sausage because they are quite delicious. The eggs are a little dirty looking because I scrambled them in the sausage grease. Mmmmm......</p>

A couple weeks ago, I got this crazy hankering for a good salad. Just tossed around some lettuce, tomatoes and cheese along with some deli meat I had lying around (it&#39;d have gone bad soon, anyways). It was pretty awesome, but there was actually more than I could handle over the course of several days and the rest had to be tossed. Not used to cooking small quantities, am I.</p>

My supper last night. This is a dish affectionately known in my family as &quot;turkey balls&quot;. It&#39;s really nothing more than slightly browned balls of ground turkey simmered in some cream of mushroom soup and milk. I also mixed an egg and some breadcrumbs into the ground turkey. On top of rice, this is a pretty awesome meal.</p>
