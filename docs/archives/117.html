The people who are buying our house have basically set everything in stone and so now our house and the house we&#39;re getting will all have &quot;Sold&quot; signs. So now the packing begins (our room&#39;ll be a nightmare :-P) and in probably about two weeks we&#39;ll be in our house :-D. btw, here&#39;s some info on our <a href="http://remax.realtor.com/Prop/1048630457?lnksrc=00045&amp;gate=remax">new house</a>.</p>
<p>A couple days ago I picked up my free version of <a href="http://www.linspire.com">Linspire</a> and I decided to try to move over to Linux full time for a month. I got it installed and it was certainly nice looking. I went through some trouble figuring out how to use apt packages but I started to get the hang of things. And then the trouble set in. PHP was giving me problems with MySQL, depending on what program I tried I couldn&#39;t get the sound working/synced on DVDs (or avis) and Lsongs, while nice, obviously was running on a low priority because it would cut out frequently. And things went down from there. So, I&#39;m back on a fresh install of Win2K3 and it&#39;s nice to be home.</p>
<p>Got an interesting piece of mail the other day about a college down in Florida called FullSail that specializes in film [pre/post]-production. It&#39;s quite interesting because next to game programming the realm of film is my other big area of fascination. So whether I&#39;m going to DigiPen or this place is kind of a toss up. I guess I&#39;ll worry about that when I get there. Right now I have to keep studying for ye olde GED and get a job (so I can buy my laptop ;-)).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for today. Stay tuned.</p>

So for those of you out there who pray please add in an extra word to the man upstairs that all this goes through :-).</p>
<p>Bowling league starts again in a couple weeks (13th) which I am looking forward to. Dad and I had been on a Monday league over the summer, but it was with &quot;commoners&quot; (i.e. people who come and bowl every now and again) and the atmosphere was.... common :-P. Now we&#39;ll be in a USBCC sanctioned league again with all our bowling buddies from last year :-D.</p>
<p>I will be updating in as much as I can. Stay tuned. Now back to our regularly scheduled program...</p>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all thinking because we&#39;re moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).</p>
<p>But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It&#39;s not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.</p>
<p>Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I&#39;m in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game <a href="http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test">here.</a></p>
<p>I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I&#39;m not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let&#39;s face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I&#39;m sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you&#39;re interested in helping check out the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a>.</p>

The showing last night went incredibly well, apparently. So well, in fact, that the guy is going to be getting his financing in order within the next day or so. So that means I will be <strong>movingprog!!</strong></p>
<p>In other news, Steve&#39;s Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It&#39;ll be nice to have something to play again.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/ahhh-programming">Ahhh... programming</a></h2><time>August 22, 2005</time><div><p>I&#39;ve managed to land myself on a project that combines my two loves: games and web. Tryblithe, owner of <a href="http://www.ctsquare.net">CT Square</a> web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it&#39;s all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it&#39;s much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that&#39;s pretty cool :-)</p>
<p>Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that&#39;s about all there is to report there.</p>
<p>Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That&#39;s right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought &quot;Hey, this looks kind of cool&quot;. But I&#39;ve been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is &quot;We&#39;re coming soon!&quot;, &quot;Almost there...&quot;, &quot;blah blah blah...&quot;. One of their so called &quot;storez&quot; was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here&#39;s is Amazon&#39;s reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:</p>
<p>[quote]&quot;At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
web site.  </p>
<p>Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
their site.&quot;[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, real legit :-P.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)</p>
