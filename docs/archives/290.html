Yay!</h2><time>September 15, 2005</time><div><p>We went through our grand tour of the house today (second for me) and I was able to snap some pictures. So, here they are:</p>

<p>I seem to be missing pictures of the master bedroom as well as Steve and Joe&#39;s room, but that&#39;s the gist of it. </p>
<p>Most of our stuff (and when I say our I&#39;m usually refferring to Jeff, Chris and myself since we are roomies) is all packed and ready to go.</p>
<p>Well, we&#39;re getting down to the wire on this but it looks like we&#39;re gonna make it! Part of me is kind of sad that we&#39;re going to leave this house (I mean, I&#39;ve lived here 18 out of 19 years of my life), but it&#39;ll be nice to move on.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The moving begins!</h2><time>September 14, 2005</time><div><p>Our realtor called today and apparently we should&#39;ve been packing a week ago because now we&#39;re left with exactly one week to pack! So, I&#39;ve been going through my stuff today (nuked a few CDs :-D) and getting ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first night of bowling and a good night of bowling it was. The first two games were sort of ehhhh, but the last game was my best yet. I&#39;ll let the image speak for itself (haven&#39;t tested this Tetra feature, so it&#39;s overdue ;-)):

Yeah, 207! My dad was only 18 ahead of me at 225 (I beat him the first game :-D). If this had been last year I would&#39;ve gotten my 100 pins over average watch. Pooh :-P. </p>
<p>Well, with the moving and all, it may be a while until I can put anything up. I&#39;ll try to squeak out a little blurb before I have to pack my computer. Cheers :-)</p>
