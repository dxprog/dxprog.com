It&#39;s a somewhat bittersweet feeling. It&#39;s awesome not to have to have the nightmares of work hanging over my head, but on the flipside I won&#39;t be able to hang around with all the pals I made over the last year and a half. Not to mention the seemingly endless supply of money is non-existant now. Oh well.</p>
<p>What really sucks, though, is the fact that I&#39;ve been sick the last several days. Actually it&#39;s more allergies than anything else. I blame the rotting vegitation due to receeding <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/tags/flood/">flood waters</a>.</p>
<p>I recently finished Crackdown. It&#39;s an awesome game but the ending really, really sucks. It sucked so bad I haven&#39;t played it since. Originally I bought Crackdown for the Halo 3 beta (which I never really played much) but the main game is still pretty sweet. I probably will start working on Final Fantasy XII again or maybe Halo 2. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t even finished Halo 1. Oh, Xbox 360 extended warranty ftw! I&#39;m no longer paranoid about using it.</p>
<p>Well, I have an important nap I have to take, so later!</p>

This time, however, is because our wonderful little town has been flooded. Since the river runs between me and my place of employment I am trapped in my house. And what a better way to waste time than by drawing.</p>

<p>Mostly some experimental stuff especially with posing, hair and head shape. Of course, the thing that gets me frustrated most is body proportions and limbs. However, I&#39;m pretty happy with how these turned out.</p>

Now it&#39;s gone. Lost forever in the digital mines of hell. I&#39;ll give you the basic rundown without the commentary because I don&#39;t feel like typing it again.</p>

Why? Because I can. That, my friend, is the beauty of the internets.</p>
<p>Top 5 Games I Wasted Too Much Time Playing</p>
<p><strong>5. Guitar Hero (I and II)</strong>
I will go on the record and say this is probably the best game of this generation. If I were getting paid per hour to play this game the same amount I&#39;m getting paid to push carts I&#39;d be freakin&#39; rich. I figure I&#39;ve probably played Freebird alone somewhere around 50-100 times and it&#39;s a ten minute song. It never really gets old.</p>
<p><strong>4. Final Fantasy VI</strong>
Only the best RPG made for the SNES, nay, of all time. I&#39;ve fully completed this game three times, partially many more, and I plan on playing through it again before I head off to college. It&#39;s that good.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past</strong>
I remember the first time I finally made it through this game. I&#39;d been playing it for darn near a year. I probably explored every nook and cranny and thensome. I&#39;ve since made it through twice on GBA and clocked many more hours on PC via emulation. Defeinitely one of the best games ever.</p>
<p><strong>2. Super Mario Bros. 3</strong>
The very first game I ever played. I haven&#39;t played this one to completion as many times as other games (due mainly to the fact that there&#39;s no save in the original NES version) but I did play it almost every day for pretty much the entire life of my first NES (two or three years). I have it on for my NES now (and I crack it out once in a while) and have the GBA version. This game pretty much set and holds the standard for all patforming games. Nothing&#39;s come close since.</p>
<p><strong>1. Tetris Attack</strong>
Oh, my gosh. Where to begin. I&#39;ve clocked more hours on this game than probably all the others combined. I&#39;ve spent countless hours writing this game on five different occasions (and am currently doing so again). I haven&#39;t bought Plant Puzzle League for DS because I&#39;m a Tetris Attack purist. Give me Blargg or give me death! Actually, I probably should buy it just for the online play, but I&#39;d use standard controls. None of this touch screen crap.</p>
<p>I do need to mention that Rogue Squadron, Episode I Racer, Zelda OoT, and Mario 64 are close runner ups. So, there you have it. Day one completed. Stay tuned for more inaninty on here at dxprog.com.</p>

This is something to be joyous about. However, it was not meant to be this way. Thanks to my wonderful shoes, which have been possesed by the very soul of Satan himself, my foot is in pain. It sucks. Actually, it&#39;s sad more than it sucks for today was supposed to be the last Saturday I ever work at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>This Friday, July 6th, marks my final day there. There is indeed light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. I&#39;ve already planned a few things I am going to do before school starts. Theyare as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend a &quot;Weird Al&quot; concert</li>
<li>Start up a new comic</li>
<li>Practice piano</li>
<li>Read some books</li>
<li>Other various sundries</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. This will be like the most awesome summer EVAR!</p>
