<p>[quote]It&#39;s 7pm as I write this. The thought of returning to the interwebs feels kind of like how it felt to return to Griffin, something I find odd and slightly disconcerting...</p>
<p>Made a trip down the turnpike yesterday for a surprise visit to Chris. Snacks were had and Monopoly was played, just like olden days. I also read all six of his volumes of Future Diary since. I suppose you could say I&#39;m hooked...</p>
<p>Jeff and I shall soon be lighting up another fire in the fireplace tonight. Staring at its mesmerizing glow should eat up a couple or so hours.</p>

[quote]In less than 36 hours, I will again be able to dip my toes in the vast ocean of the internet. It is a moment I eagerly await.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the most difficult day yet. It was a dreadfully slow day at work which left me wanting to surf the old stand bys (reddit, youtube, facebook, etc.) Instead, I spent time combing the news sites, reading articles, and contemplating performance improvements.</p>
<p>At home, things aren&#39;t so bad. I can nap or read or whatever. I&#39;ve nearly finished all of my Toradora manga, leaving Oreimo and Yotsuba on my high priority pile.</p>
<p>One day...[/quote]</p>
