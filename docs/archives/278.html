<p>I am old. I know I don&#39;t look it, but I can feel it in my heart of hearts. Why, I feel all thin, sort of <em>stretched</em>, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can&#39;t be right. I need a change, or something. In almost two months I&#39;m going to be twenty and what do I have to show for it? A job, sure (more juicy on this in a sec), but as of yet no driver&#39;s license, no high school diploma and not much of a plan for the rest of my life. Well, having been kind of depressed the last few days I&#39;ve decided to do something about it. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to schedule a driving test for next week and a testing date for the GED (probably sometime in late April, early May). I am bound and determined to accomplish at least these two things before my teenage years are forever behind me.</p>
<p>Now, the juicy details. As you all know I am working in groceries labelling overstock and putting it on shelves in a position I&#39;d since been calling &quot;Overstock Manager&quot;. Well, I recieved my official designation Saturday: Grocery ICS (Inventory Control Specialist). While being a &quot;specialist&quot; is cool and all the real interesting part happened yesterday. I recieved an e-mail from one of my old layaway/cashier pals Blake congratulating me on my promotion to department manager. I laughed it off and told him he had the wrong guy, but this morning when I was doing training modules it had me listed under two job codes: ICS Team and Department Manager (dept. 92, dry grocery). It&#39;s so nice when they tell me these things :-P. In not even five months I&#39;ve gone from a lowly layaway runner to a department managing specialist. I figure if things continue at this rate I&#39;ll be CEO of the company by the time my first year anniversary rolls around ;-).</p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s no more interesting news to report and thus I will sign off and go eat some food. Peace out.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Revolution is on our Doorstep</h2><time>March 22, 2006</time><div><p>Today, with any luck, we&#39;ll get a whole mess of new info from Nintendo on the Revolution. Of course, I&#39;ll be at work :-P. But, the whole reason I post this (aside from the fact that I&#39;m a Nintendo fan boy) is because of a <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2686716?htv=12">little cartoon</a> my bro found. Actually, that last part is very true. On a side note, the soundtrack is awesome!</p>
<p>This is sad, I tell you. I&#39;ve got to go to work at 8am this morning and here it is almost 1:30am and I&#39;m awake talking about how the Revolution will r0x0r. You can tell that I have virtually no life at all. I spent most of yesterday afternoon writing a little RSS <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/patternrss.php?user=dxprog">feed generator</a> to keep track of my <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/patterns.asp?UserLogin=dxprog">ACC pattern stats</a>. Albiet it was kind of fun, but a total waste of time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I also tried out <a href="http://www.americasarmy.com">America&#39;s Army</a>, a free game developed by, surprise, the Army. The basic training missions were okay (especially the shoot house), but after that things just died off (like learning how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation :-P). It was informative, but things like that are best left to the classroom. The complete lack of any single player missions was what turned me off in the end. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t expect anything more coming from the Army, but games aren&#39;t supposed to be real life replicas of boot camp :-P. At least now I can tell these army recruiters who come to Wal-Mart &quot;I played the game and I didn&#39;t like it.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I really must try to get some sleep now. Just remember, nitro-glycerin is incredibly dangerous and unsafe to drink :-)</p>
