In the last post I said I was going to make a GlovePIE script, but it seems I have been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIre8qkQIvs">beaten to the punch</a>. You&#39;ll find the script in the description of the linked video and I can confirm that it works with the 360 drum kit.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Good-bye vacation</h2><time>November 26, 2007</time><div><p>A wise man once said all good things must come to an end. So it is true for me as my week long Thanksgiving vacation is over effective 8:00AM EST tomorrow morning. However, I will certainly say that it has been a rather interesting week for me.</p>
<p>There is, of course, my <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/hack-rock-band-drums-to-work-with-windows-marvel-at-them-working-with-windows-55562.phtml">obvious</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/23/use-the-rock-band-drums-with-your-pc/">return</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/22/rock-band-drum-kit-hacked-for-windows/">to</a> <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/clip/rock-band-drums-work-on-pc-326030.php">fame</a> thanks in no small part to idle curiosity and a couple minutes of nifty text editing. And to those who&#39;ve been messing around with the drums program from the prior post, I have been paying attention to your comments. At this point I&#39;ve abandoned that program in lieu of a GlovePIE script. More on that as things unfold.</p>
<p>An interesting development that spun off of all that hype was a small little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/welcome-to-the-brawl-of-the-century/#comments">comment</a> left on a completely unrelated topic. It was from a producer at EA who basically said &quot;Hey, want to do some game testing now and maybe come work for us after college?&quot; When I first read that my small appartment was filled with whooping and jumping (this was before I got sick, more on that in a minute). It would be completely awesome if this were to pan out for me. Not only would I get some extra cash on the side while still in school, but I could go straight from graduation right into the industry that I&#39;ve always dreamed of working in.</p>
<p>This whole thing is a perfect testimony to what I&#39;ve been told by many people: throw yourself out there, you never know who&#39;s looking. I&#39;ve been slowly working on my online presence since I joined YPN in January of &#39;02. Since then I&#39;ve dipped into almost every kind of online media there is. From running a message board, to podcasting, to online videos. Basically what I&#39;m trying to say is, if you&#39;ve got something that you think is good, put up online and do a little bit of shameless advertising. If I can come this far with one little video and a tip suggestion to Engadget and Joystiq there&#39;s no reason why anybody else can&#39;t. /end soapbox moment</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, I am &quot;sick&quot;. I put it in quotes because it&#39;s not as bad as my usual form of sickness. Usually I get a sore throat, runny, feel weak, and just downright terrible over all. This, however, is confined mainly to the sore throat combined with a little bit of hoarse voice. Luckily, with the exception of the throat I feel physically fine. I was well enough to bike up to school today to pick up the books for my next wave of classes, namely Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Mathematics (CMD).</p>
<p>DAT looks to be rather interesting as it is basically a traditional art class (no computers) with a design oriented twist. I&#39;ve heard from two sources now that we&#39;re going to be getting a large amount of art supplies so that&#39;ll be cool. CMD is basic math up through intermediate Algebra. I jumped to the middle of my book and was able to figure out what was going on so I&#39;m feeling pretty confident about that. Plus, I got a free Algebric calculator, though I doubt I&#39;ll ever use it. I usually do all my problem solving on paper.</p>
<p>Well, I feel I&#39;ve rambled on enough. Before I go I just want to give a quick shout out to any new readers I may have picked up through the hulla-balloo. Peace out.</p>
