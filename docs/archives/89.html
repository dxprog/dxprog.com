<p>Starting today I&#39;m off hiatus. There&#39;ll be a few changes however. Firstly, Jimmy&#39;s that guy in the middle. His hair is much easier to draw now. Secondly, that would be Mary on the right. These two things were the main reason I went on hiatus. Thirdly, there&#39;ll be a format change. I&#39;m going to do more story arcs instead of weak jokes and sad parodies. Finally, I&#39;ll be going with a every Wednesday update. Now that I&#39;m full time at Wal-Mart it&#39;s difficult to update twice a week. I figure I should also be able to keep this up once I&#39;m in college in the fall.</p>

<p>I had to come off hiatus to bring you that comic. My Photoshop trial is up so I&#39;m having to resort to more archaic methods of drawing at the moment. Btw, the new Spider-man 3 sneak peak has restored some faith in me that it won&#39;t suck.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>More Crap</h2><time>March 7, 2007</time><div><p>Wow! Two posts in one day?! I must be on crack! Tonight I give you another sad venture into art on my behalf. This time it is Terra of Final Fantasy VI fame. If you couldn&#39;t tell this one was done in colored pencil.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>And Now for Something Completely Different...</h2><time>March 7, 2007</time><div><p>Just because I haven&#39;t been updating the comic lately doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t been doing anything. I&#39;ve been doing plenty of highly constructive stuff, such as making inane parodies like the on you&#39;re about to see. Enjoy!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>A Word on the State of Apple</h2><time>March 2, 2007</time><div><p>As you may or may not know I am currently the owner of a new Mac Mini (Core Duo FTW!). Despite the fact that Windows is easily installed thanks to the magic of Boot Camp, I&#39;ve been working in OS X mostly. I feel I&#39;ve been using it long enough to give my opinion:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use. Once I figured out the basics I pretty much got it.</li>
<li>Stability (for the most part). A few minutes ago Safari died an ugly death on me dragging the rest of the system down with it and I&#39;ve been in a must reboot situation twice (not including the system updates)</li>
<li>Pretty looking. Hey, what can I say? I&#39;m a sucker for the genie effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple&#39;s interface guidlines tend to make apps overly simplistic. Toolbars are almost non-existant, everything seems to revolve around a drag and drop interface. This is an area where Windows apps can really shine given a developer who knows what they are doing.</li>
<li>Keyboard craziness. I don&#39;t know about you, but I use the Home and End keys to navigate through text boxes all the time. Albiet, it&#39;s still there (Cmd-Left and Right respectively), but pressing two keys (or three if I want to make a selection) is a lot harder. Also, they seemed to ignore the delete key as well. I&#39;m not a mouse person and I don&#39;t want to drag my effin&#39; files to the trash. I want to press delete (and Enter to close the resulting dialog box).</li>
<li>Unix directory structure. Windows can be incredibly clean in directory structure if done right. Unix is much, much more difficult and half the folders you can&#39;t see anyways. Also, mountpoints drive me nuts (although, OS X seems to keep track of all that fairly well).</li>
<li>Finally, hardware support. They tell you &quot;it just works&quot; but that&#39;s a lie. There are no drivers for my scanner (forcing me to use a piece of shareware), minimal support for my printer, NO support for my flash drive just to name a few. Driver support is something people complain about in Windows, but I have never, EVER had a problem with hardware in XP.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now that I&#39;m through with that I&#39;ll deliver my verdict: Windows XP SP2 is the best OS ever (and I&#39;ve used Vista so I can rule that one out). That said, OS X is definitely the best flavor of Unix I&#39;ve ever seen and I can get along with it nicely.</p>
