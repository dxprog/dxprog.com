It has been my pet project for a year now and has been the catalyst for a few leaps in coding practice for me. Firstly, it&#39;s responsible for my becoming quite adept at advanced &quot;OOP&quot;-like JavaScript-ing. Secondly, it&#39;s given me an outlet to try out new things such as dynamic graphs in PHP or using Bing&#39;s search API. Let&#39;s take a brief walk through history.

Of course, it took them this long to get me my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/3843402434/sizes/l/">diploma</a>. Now, I am usually a fairly patient person, but there is one exception to that rule: mail order. Waiting for this diploma was like ordering something from Amazon and then having to wait two years for it to get here. But, it&#39;s here now and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>Well, it would be if I had a job. I&#39;ve applied to three places now, those being <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/">ConocoPhillips</a>, <a href="http://www.griffincommunications.net/properties/businesses">Griffin New Media</a> (both web dev jobs), and a contract motion graphics job out in Florida with <a href="http://www.feldentertainment.com/">Feld Entertainment</a>. Phillips I didn&#39;t hear back from for a month and a half and at that the only contact I had was a short note saying I&#39;d been passed up. I got calls from both Griffin and Feld (on the same day even), but Feld never called back after their initial call.</p>
<p>Griffin, on the other hand, has taken an interest in me and I&#39;ve had two interviews there now (both of which went pretty well, in my opinion). The people I&#39;ve interviewed with have been extremely nice and seem to have my interests in mind as well as theirs. My first interview seemed mostly to quiz me on my web development knowledge in addition to establishing what the position I&#39;d applied for entailed. The second was more formal in terms of the questions asked and the environment in which it was conducted. Also in that interview, I had to take a skills test in which was given an hour to design and code a small contest entry page. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to finish everything on the list, though my design was good and my HTML validated first crack out of the barrel. So, at this point I&#39;m waiting to hear back from them. I&#39;m really hoping for this job because it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve been working towards the last several years and the environment and people working there are really nice.</p>
<p>Outside of job hunting, there hasn&#39;t been too much more going on in my life. So, instead of wasting precious bytes telling you how awesome the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0eNHP9rBcg">Taiko no Tasujin</a> series of games is, I&#39;ll wrap it up here.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/welcome-to-esoteria">Welcome to Esoteria</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 22, 2009</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I find myself at the end of my college life, living back in good ol&#39; Oklahoma and completely bored out of my skull. Of course, there is on the near horizon the promise of employment, which should take up the next forty years of my natural life. I should relish these moments as I will not have a moment like this in some time... especially if a wife and kids are part of my ultimate master plan. But, I suppose itemization is in order.</p>
<p>Nearly a month ago, I completed my college education and graduated from Full Sail University with a bachelor of science in Digital Arts and Design. The ceremony was all very pomp with much circumstance. During my particular ceremony, there were some two hundred people graduating (all of the bachelor kids, not just my class). I marched along the line of my old instructors shaking their hands (and getting hugs from one). It felt kind of ethereal and even now I&#39;ll stop suddenly and realize... it&#39;s over. Everything that had sucked up my very being for the last twenty-one months is finished.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s all done and now I&#39;m back home with my family. Not a bad place to be, I suppose. The plan was to take a hiatus after the near non-stop barrage of school. It&#39;s been nice, no doubt about that, but now I feel restless. I want to do something and I don&#39;t have anything that needs to be done. So, that would suggest to me that it&#39;s time to return to the working forces, a new and more educated man.</p>
<p>Actually, a couple weeks back I applied at ConocoPhillips (the family workplace) for an opening they had for an ASP.NET developer. I&#39;ve yet to hear anything, but my application is supposedly under &quot;secondary review&quot; same as it has been since the offer closed on the seventeenth. The waiting is killing me and never have I been so eager to receive a phone call. I suppose if this falls through (as it&#39;s kind of looking like, but I&#39;ll give it a bit more time) there&#39;s another place in town that I&#39;m going to apply at. It&#39;s a design group that I more than qualify for (HTML/PHP type stuffs), so maybe I&#39;ll have some more luck there.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to find a job soon. I suppose if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll have more time to update this blog. Hooray for you.</p>

I&#39;m sure I say it every time I do this, but this iteration is by far the most advanced version of the site to date. I can pretty much wrap up all the updates in a nutshell by saying I&#39;ve had a lot of fun throwing in all sorts of jQuery and Ajaxy stuff, but I&#39;ll itemize.</p>
<p>The front page, for starters, shows the latest and greatest projects and blog posts on the site in the featured pane. The gallery has undergone a huge overhaul and is much more intuitive than it was before. I&#39;ve also uploaded quite a lot of new content to the gallery page, so go take a gander at that to see what awesome stuff I&#39;ve been up to. And finally, even the contact is looking spiffier with a picture of yours truly and a link to all the social media outlets I&#39;m currently signed up for.</p>
<p>With the new design out of the way, I&#39;ll shift focus to the new {mh}labs; section of the website, where you&#39;ll be able to find all sorts of little pojects that have never been released to the general public (and some that have).</p>
<p>The future is bright at dxprog.com, so be sure to bookmark us and return often for all sorts of goody goodness.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/all-good-things">All Good Things</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 28, 2009</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It seems that ignoring the blog is the fashionable thing for me to do, as of late. It&#39;s not entirely intentional, there&#39;s just really nothing to talk about. Sometimes, while I&#39;m attempting to force myself into a state of unconsciousness, I&#39;ll think of these things I&#39;d love to post ranting about this, that, or the other. However, rarely do I actually act upon these impulses and the dust continues to gather.</p>
<p>The one thing that has happened since I last blogged is the passage of time. And with that passage I draw ever nearer to my graduation date. Currently, I sit at less than a month till I walk with my fellow classmates and receive the piece of paper for which I have worked so hard to achieve. It&#39;s hard to believe that not two years ago I was making preparations to come here the thought of actual completion not even in my head. But, here we are.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve achieved much in my short twenty-one months at Full Sail, both from an academic and personal standpoint. I&#39;ve improved my design skills, learned the technical art of motion graphics, and added to my repertoire of marketable programming skills through ActionScript. I know better how things in the industry work and have finally been able to get the professional critique that I so longed for as a hobbyist working out of his parents&#39; house.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made a lot of memories at this school, both good and bad. It&#39;ll be sad to have leave all the friends I&#39;ve made, but everyone tells me I have a bright future ahead of me. As for what I think of that, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I know I have marketable skills, but there are some things that I know will hold me back. For example, I would like to live close to my family. That alone throws out almost any motion graphics or film job that I could have. I suppose it boils down to what&#39;s more important to me: my family and friends or my career. Even at that, I don&#39;t really know what career path I&#39;d like to do. i enjoy and am proficient at many things (both inside and outside my degree).</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;ll stop there before I completely depress myself. The next few months are going to have a crucial part in shaping my future. I&#39;d better make damn sure I get it right.</p>
