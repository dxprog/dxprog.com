<p>Well, it&#39;s once again that time of year. Wait... I&#39;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>In celebration of the upcoming Easter season, I have gone and hidden an easter egg right here my little ol&#39; website. I task you, my wonderful viewers, to find this easter egg and, once you&#39;ve found it, post either a screen shot or description of the egg right here in the comments. The first person to find it just very well may get a prize of some sort (maybe an old game I don&#39;t want or a drawing or whatever).</p>
<p>SO! Put on your detective eyes and clicking things, scrutinizing pixels, inspecting source code, whatever. How will you know you&#39;ve found it? Oh, trust me. You&#39;ll know...</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like <em>less</em> progress than the [screen shots/0.jpg)](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZuAdDLlib8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZuAdDLlib8</a>]</p>
<p>A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like <em>less</em> progress than the [screen shots)(<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots">http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots</a>) I put up previously, but it does demonstrate some things that static pictures cannot: &quot;motion&quot; and audio.</p>
<p>As can be seen by that video, the graphics have quite some major problems and will be my next area of concern. However, I did get jumping between scenario files working and, in theory, the entire game is playable. After getting the graphics to a place I can live with, I plan on rolling out the public beta for people to tinker with.</p>
