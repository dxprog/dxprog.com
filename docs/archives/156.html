Safari, however, is pissing me off. The colors on here don't render properly. It's the same problem that plagued IE4-5. So the gradient at the top doesn't properly blend into the background. Instead it's a disgusting blocky chunk. At that the gradient isn't smooth like it's doing some sort of weird compression thing a la AOL. Apple, if you're software "just works" why does it have problems that were fixed over ten years ago? Bastards.

Anyways... I now have less than one month in my current place of residence. On September 18th I set sail (heh) for Florida and my future. It's about the only thing I think about and it's making time go incredibly slow. To say I'm looking forward to the move would be like saying Jesus is a good man. But, I do not wish to dwell on the topic and more.

Yesterday I rented Mario Strikers Charged (Wii). It's okay. Online play is always a plus, but they really dropped the ball on the music. Every piece of music is a two to five second loop. It really, really, really blows chunks. But the game itself is pretty fun and it controls well. So if you just mute the TV and turn on some tunes its not so bad. Too bad the Wii doesn't support this instrisnicly like a certain other console...</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/safari-how-you-piss-me-off">Safari how you piss me off!</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 19, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I&#39;ve been booting over to OS X lately seeing as I&#39;ll have to get used to it when I go to school.

I found a slight error in my previous statement about the Britons. Patrick Stewart. He's more awesome than most Americans.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/i-hate-brits">I hate Brits!</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 16, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content">The title has absolutely no bearing on the subject matter of this post, but I thought I'd throw it out there. Everytime they say "biscuit" instead of cookie I think to myself "Stupid, buscuiting Brits!". But I digress.

Actually, one thing I hate more than Brits is fruit flies. And, apparently, they hate me too. They've been trying to kill me lately. Over the last two weeks they've sent suicide bombers down my windpipe and up my esophagus. It's really pissing me off. I'll be happily watching Next Gen or something, there'll be a faint "bzzztt" followed by the nast coughing fits. Burn in Hell, fruit flies, burn in hell.

Finished with my Pokemon game I decided to have some fun. That's right, I hacked my save file. Actually, I'm thinking of selling the game off and picking up Puzzle League. As much as I still think it's a bastardization of Tetris Attack (which I've been playing like crazy as of late) the thought of ranked online matches is a sweet morsel I may not be able to pass up. Maybe I'll just stick with Tetris DS for now. Maybe I should stop buying games.

At least until Eternal Sonata comes out ;-)</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/157.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/155.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
