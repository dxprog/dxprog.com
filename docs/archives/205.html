It was freakin&#39; sweet! He played pretty much every song off of Straight Out of Lynwood plus most of the mainstays (Eat It, Fat, Smells Like Nirvana, etc.). For the encore he played the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjJYywFNbuw">cellphone song</a> to which everybody, myself included, started waving their cellphones. After that he wound up with an extended version of Albuquerque. It was simply awesome. I shunned my quiet exterior and clapped and whooed and sang with everybody else. But, you&#39;re probably saying &quot;Shuddup, give us teh pix!&quot; I&#39;ve only got a few because getting good pictures with the crazy lighting so I&#39;m only giving you the good ones. Sucks to be you.

Remember when every site on the internet had some sort of cross-page transition? Remember when all sites used Times New Roman for their font? Remember animated GIFs? I do. Good Lord, those days sucked!</p>
