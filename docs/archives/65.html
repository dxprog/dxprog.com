The implementation I&#39;ve used is actually very, very similar to what I used in YPNgine back in 2003; a switch statement calling functions from an included script based upon variables passed in the query string. Granted, there&#39;s going to be some degree of that in any implementation, but through some tinkering with the music page and interviewing with some of the developer&#39;s at Digg has led me to a new paradigm: a set RESTful API calls independent of all front end management.</p>
<p>Now, aside from the nice code separation and simplification of feature adds and maintainability this provides, it also opens up a new world to Ajax. Since all the data is accessible via query string, almost all the usual functionality that would normally call for separate pages can be added in without ever having to leave the landing page. In fact, I&#39;ve <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/dxsite2">implemented this</a> functionality on the test server. As interesting as this may sound, it raises some interesting issues concerning usability and the user experience.</p>
<p>The largest concern is that of site navigation or, more specifically, navigation history. In a normal site, every page you visit will be added to the site history, appending itself to the not only pages visited, but the forward and back buttons as needed. With Ajax, you have none of this. Were you to click a link to a story and have it loaded via Ajax, your browser history does not change. Pressing the back button will take you to the previous entered URL and not the previous page because, technically, you&#39;re still on the same page. The new page won&#39;t be placed in browsing history which could make finding back a particular story particularly difficult. And, finally, because the page never changes, neither does the URL in the address bar which could lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Say you entered my site on the gallery page using the url <a href="http://dxprog.com/gallery">http://dxprog.com/gallery</a> and eventually found your way to to the June 2006 blog archives, specifically to a story about my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/tryin-to-survive/">life without a laptop</a>. Because the page never actually changes, the address bar will continue to read <a href="http://dxprog.com/gallery">http://dxprog.com/gallery</a> even though that content is no longer there. This would have made my retrieval of the URL for that story more difficult and, had the title not been permalinked, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to retrieve it at all.</p>
<p>Another thing to take into consideration is search engines. When Google crawls your site it doesn&#39;t have JavaScript enabled. So, unless you write duplicate functionality to generate the page before sending to the browser, none of your content will get indexed. I face this problem with the current gallery implementation; even though there is a way for me to access individual items via the query string, there are no hard links on the gallery page itself to point to them. Even if there was, all of the content is loaded on the client side so search engine spiders are just going to get a blank page devoid of content. Not a very smart idea if you want that content indexed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when it comes to Ajax and dynamically loading content, you really have to consider carefully what should and shouldn&#39;t be dynamically loaded. Portal pages - any page with links into sub pages of the site such - are probably best left to the traditional method of loading a new page for each item. Smaller things such as paginating an entry&#39;s comments probably wouldn&#39;t hurt as much since it is an aside to the main material. Though, even then there may be something interesting you&#39;d want picked up on a search engine. It&#39;s really is a balancing act between slick functionality and overall usability.</p>

<p>As one may have derived from previous posts, I have a <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/smp/">project</a> the uses MP3s quite heavily. As such, retrieving tag data from these is quite an important thing. Having recently migrated my personal server to Windows, I needed a non-Linux variant of my previous <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/building-a-web-based-media-player---part-1/">tag read</a>. I thought that while I was at it I could add an additional feature, namely saving embedded album art. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any clear directions on how to do so using <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">TagLib</a>, so I created my own library. Three different times. In three different languages. A C++ version, a .NET version and, finally, a PHP version.

Recently, while making some additions to the <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/smp/">Music Page</a>, I came across the need to get the location of a YouTube FLV. Unfortunately, most of my googling turned up outdated results that no longer work. Fortunately, unlike a certain <a href="http://hulu.com/">other</a> site, it&#39;s not impossible. Below is a quick explanation of what I got to work. I&#39;ll be assuming that you know how to get your hands on the video ID (the &quot;v&quot; parameter in the query string).

<p>One thing that I&#39;ve attempted to take up again is drawing. My skills currently sit somewhere between mediocre and decent, a stat I&#39;d certainly like to level up. So, my brother Chris and I have periodically enjoyed an evening of drawing while watching the nerdy sitcom, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">Big Bang Theory</a>. Unfortunately, we&#39;ve finished the first two seasons and now are forced to wait a week for new episodes, as the third season just began. For the off days, BBT has been summarily replaced with Pinky and the Brain.</p>
<p>In keeping with my new found - and probably unhealthy - fascination with the land of the rising sun, I&#39;ve been taking cues from the manga/anime style (much of which is fan art). So, for those who enjoy that sort of thing, here&#39;s a gallery of some of the artwork I&#39;ve created over the lest month and a half.</p>
<p>[gallery=Summer 2009 Art]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Konata.jpg" alt="" title="Konata Izumi from Lucky Star. My first crack at getting back into drawing and, arguably, the worst"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Tsukasa.jpg" alt="" title="Tsukasa Hiiragi. Another piece of fanart from Lucky Star. This has replaced my long standing Yoko desktop wallpper."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Midori_sketch.jpg" alt="" title="Midori Kasugano of Midori Days. Probably the most bizarre premise to a story I&#39;ve yet encountered, but it was funny and endearing; a throughly enjoyable read/watch."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Keri.jpg" alt="" title="A character of my own devise. I named her Keri."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Haruhi.jpg" alt="" title="Haruhi Suzumiya. Probably one of the best sci-fi/highschool mash-ups I&#39;ve ever seen. Well, the only one I&#39;ve seen."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nia_sketch.jpg" alt="" title="Nia... somebody, straight out of Gurren Laggan. This anime kicked the BallZ right out of Dragon Ball">[/gallery]</p>
<p>So, there it is. You probably noticed that there&#39;s a bit of a common theme to the above pictures (beyond the manga/anime thing). If you didn&#39;t, you lose five points and get no cookie.</p>

Over the past few days, I&#39;ve been developing a library to help in drawing graphs for various stuff on the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page">music page</a>. I&#39;ve built to to be a fairly complete solution that is both robust and simple to use.
