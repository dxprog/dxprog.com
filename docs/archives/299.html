Good time to write a blog entry ;-).</p>
<p>I decided to pick up the threads of ACPD3. I&#39;ve been having fun getting the idiot BSTRs to work again :-P. I&#39;m going to be moving as much as I can to the DLL this time around and figuring out how to avoid DLL hell, too. For a change people actually seem to be interested this time. But I also basically said I&#39;m shooting to make an Anicro replacement and went for the people who use it. A brilliant strategy :-D.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My REAL Blog</h2><time>June 3, 2005</time><div><p>Here it is, Tetra Blog (beta)! Coming down the road are a few more styles, and the ability to add sidebars. These can be any Tetra sidebar so I&#39;m going to be rigging up an RSS feed reader sometime in the near future. That combined with the <echoy effect>Universal Document Module</echoy effect> will make Tetra quite a nicely rounded little CMS :-). And for anybody who&#39;d make a rebuttal to that last statement, Tetra is mainly for personal sites or small groups (like YPN), so SHUT UP! ;-).</p>
<p>Ah, I think I shall play some games tonight. I haven&#39;t done that in heaven knows how long :-P. That ought to change pretty quick once I have Twilight Princess in my hot little hands ;-). I do have my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/TAttack.zip">TAttack</a> game. One of the reasons I made it was so that I could play that again (leagally). Well, at least my bros and people on <a href="http://www.tetrisattack.net">tetrisattack.net</a> are enjoying it.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick up the loose threads of <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ACPatDes.zip">ACPD</a> 3 and continue the &quot;war&quot; on Anicro Desapro. Of course, for all I know, ACPD is the most used pattern maker on ACC (probably not, though :-P). Oh well.</p>
<p>Well, I got kind of long winded in that :-P. &#39;Night :-)</p>
