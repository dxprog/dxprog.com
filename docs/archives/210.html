<p>Remember how I said I&#39;d update every Monday and Friday? Yeah, well, I&#39;m starting today.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/ddr-mania">DDR Mania</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 20, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content">Well, I didn't think I'd be the one to be sucked in by this, but I'm now hooked on DDR (Mario style). Actually, it's an incredibly satisfying game once you really get going. Not only are you burning calories faster than Bill Clinton could put them on, but it's also insanely fun at the same time. Yeah... get DDR... lose weight... have fun...

Not sure if I've said anything about being cashier again, but I'm definitely glad I came back. I get to see all my old pals again and I get to sleep through the entire morning (not like I have :-P). However, one night they had me helping i grocery again. I was dragging palettes of frozen food taller than myself all over the place and that's scarier than any other palette dragging I've done so far (especially when there's customers around).

Got my copy of New Mario Bros. last Tuesday and I'll say this: The 11 year wait for a new Mario platformer was well worth it. If feels a lot like Mario World and Mario 3 rolled together. The only gripe I have so far is that as far as I've seen there's nothing to make Mario fly :-(.

And, on a side note, after today I'm changing the F5 release schedule to Monday and Friday. Now that my evening is occupied by work again I don't have as much time to work on the comic.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/ddr-mania">DDR Mania</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 20, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Well, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be the one to be sucked in by this, but I&#39;m now hooked on DDR (Mario style).
