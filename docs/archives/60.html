The Chinese zodiac says that this year is the year of the rabbit. Finally, reason for me to stuff a picture of Haruhi and cast sporting bunny outfits at the top of a post. But, this isn&#39;t what I&#39;m here to discuss.</p>
<p>It is indeed a new year and with new years come waves and waves of resolutions. In years prior, I openly shunned the idea of making new years resolutions. Why wait for some celestial anomoly to make changes to yourself as a person? While I still hold to this belief, I now view the changing of the calendar as a time to reflect upon/mark milestones within one&#39;s life. That said, here is my list of things I would like to accomplish in 2011.

Anybody who has perused this blog for more than five minutes is acutely aware of this. One thing I did in August &#39;09 was to add play stat tracking in so I could see what had been listened to when. Now that this functionality has been in for a full calendar, I&#39;ve culled all the data to present a bunch of pure CSS graphs filled with 2010&#39;s listening habits.</p>

Any kind of original documentation that resided on Lik-sang where I oriinally released MPSS is now gone (thanks, Sony) so, I&#39;m here to provide a real tutorial as there seems to be interest for the old skinner that I didn&#39;t realize still existed. So, here is the official MP Skin Studio tutorial, brought to you by dxprog. I&#39;ll go through the entire process making a real skin as I go.

<p>Wanted to try my hand at creating something with the tablet from scratch. Additionally, I wanted to test out some SAI stuff I&#39;d learned by watching some speed paints. This is the result.</p>
