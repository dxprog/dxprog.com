Editing parts I don&#39;t like out of songs comes to mind (I&#39;ve done this on more than one occasion). However, the latest target of my artistic raping is the live action video for Ningyo Hime, the Chobits closer and a song I much enjoy. While I do enjoy Japan&#39;s animated fare quite a lot, I am of the mind that they really suck at live action. The video of this song suffers from a lack of vision and direction, but more importantly it looks like it was shot on an old Sony HandyCam. I sought to &quot;correct&quot; this issue by using it as practice for color correction. After dropping the frame rate to 24 - down from a too smooth looking 29.97 - and slaughtering the blue color channel, this is what came out:</p>

</div></article><article><h2>This is What I Think About Whilst Driving to Work</h2><time>September 10, 2010</time><div><p>On my daily commute to work I encounter three intersections (four if you include that weird three way, round the corner thing). Of these intersections, two have lights. One of these is at the cross roads of a highway, with light poles hanging out over the streets on all four corners. The other one... well, it&#39;s messed up.</p>
<p>This intersection, being comprised of two smaller roads, has two lights dangling over a singular wire running diagonally across the streets.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/streets1.png" alt="" title="Fig. 1"></p>
<p>This is all well and good, but if you happen to be stopped heading east/westbound (as denoted here by the green lights - illogical on two counts now that I think about it), you find yourself an annoying predicament.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/streets2.png" alt="" title="Fig. 2"></p>
<p>The yellow cone represents one&#39;s field of vision. As you can see, the driver of this fancy white car is completely unable to see the light. He would have to hunch down and angle his neck upward at an uncomfortable angle to correct this problem. This can be made doubly worse if the driver is A) tall or B) driving in a tall vehicle. I myself have met both conditions in the past.</p>
<p>You might be looking at that diagram and be thinking to yourself &quot;Okay, there are two lights. Just use the one farther away.&quot; Which would be great, except it&#39;s positioned just so that it is obstructed by the upper left corner of the car.</p>
<p>There is a solution that could not only solve our issue but come with another small perk as well:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/streets3.png" alt="" title="Fig. 3"></p>
<p>By placing a single light over the center of the road, all drivers now have an equally decent view and there&#39;s the added bonus that you are now drawing half the amount of power than before.</p>
<p>So, City of Bartlesville street planners, take my logically thought out rant to heart and save my poor neck from this treacherous evil I must face every morning. And if I find out you all have shares in local chiropractors and this was all on purpose, then may you forever sit at a red light in the westbound lane of Price and Silver Lake down in Hell!</p>

Without knowing it, you can be featured in a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/holy-crap/">Brazilian magazine</a>, offered employment at a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/welcome-to-the-brawl-of-the-century/#comments">large game company</a> and now have one&#39;s work translated and dubbed into another language:</p>

</div></article><article><h2>A Glorious Celebration!</h2><time>June 26, 2010</time><div><p>I should hardly have to mention anymore my glorious walk for free vacation time. The graph has been sitting there up at the top of my blog page slowly counting up to the grand total of 750,000. And today, one week before deadline, I have hit that total. This little exercise has added quite a bit to my life, from friendly competition with co-workers to some much needed think time. Now, to celebrate this achievement, I give you some more photos of my journeys.[break]</p>
<h2 id="signs">Signs</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of sign stuff already, but these are things I decided didn&#39;t deserve an entire rant.
[gallery=Walking: Signs]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_shark.jpg" alt="" title="The thing I read from this sign is that the shark is telling you not to swim alone... so he can have seconds."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_sign1.jpg" alt="" title="Guess Bartlesville hasn&#39;t learned about pluralization."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_sign2.jpg" alt="" title="I don&#39;t really feel the &quot;Good Hands&quot; part here, because you obviously hired a 15-year-old YouTube commenter to write the copy for you sign. See what I did there?">[/gallery]</p>
<h2 id="graffiti">Graffiti</h2>
<p>On one of my usual trails, there is a tunnel underneath a major city street. This single tunnel is home to quite a bit of interesting (and disturbing) grafitti.

<p>Just some photos of nature being awesome.

<h2 id="interesting-oddities">Interesting Oddities</h2>
<p>A couple things that didn&#39;t fit elsewhere.
[gallery=Walking: Oddities]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_trucks.jpg" alt="" title="A fleet of ice cream trucks. I rarely ever see a single one up in B&#39;ville, so to see an entire fleet of them whilst walking in Tulsa struck me as hilariously awesome."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_buffalo1.jpg" alt="" title="Bartlesville, in a shameless rip-off of Tulsa&#39;s penguins, has these painted buffaloes strewn about town. But this one has a surprise..."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_buffalo2.jpg" alt="" title="DISCO BALLS!">[/gallery]</p>
<p>Thus ends my pictorial report of my epic wanderings. I&#39;m thinking, perhaps, that I might film a &quot;documentary&quot; at some point, but we&#39;ll see what happens there.</p>
