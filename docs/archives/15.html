So, whatever.</p>
<h2 id="normal-shows">Normal Shows</h2>
<p><strong>Breaking Bad</strong> - Currently somewhere in season 2. Everybody lost their shit over this show and, while I certainly think it&#39;s well written, it hasn&#39;t quite gotten to the &quot;gripping&quot; part for me yet. Also, the episodes are so long and deep that it&#39;s a hard one to marathon.</p>
<p><strong>Parks and Rec</strong> - Basic sitcom, and a humorous one at that. Unlike Breaking Bad, I could watch this all day. Light and fluffy.</p>
<p><strong>Star Trek (TOS)</strong> - I&#39;m somewhere down at the end of the first season and it&#39;s been entertaining so far. Despite the rocky start it&#39;s had trying to flesh out that universe, the core stories feel very Trek.</p>
<h2 id="anime">Anime</h2>
<p>The new season just started, and I don&#39;t want to give away too much of my opinions for the end-of-year reviews, so I&#39;ll keep this brief.</p>
<p><strong>Kyoukai no Kanata</strong> - The new KyoAni show, so obviously I have to watch. They&#39;ve been on kind of a fantasy/mystery kick lately and this falls right in line with that.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Time</strong> - Some college harem show. The first episode was pretty abysmal, but I&#39;ll stick around for the second to see if it improves and where they go with the cliffhanger ending.</p>
<p><strong>Little Busters Refrain</strong> - I enjoyed the first season enough to watch the second. It&#39;s Key, so generally that means emotionally manipulative stuff even if it&#39;s not being expertly executed by KyoAni.</p>
<p><strong>Nagi no Asukara</strong> - Interesting show about fish humans. I have a super weak spot for oceany type things, and the visuals hit that spot with a jack hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Kill la Kill</strong> - From the guys who brought you Gurren Lagann, another crazy ass, stylized action show.</p>
<p>So, yeah. There&#39;s my post for the day.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-fates-conspired-against-my-better-treadmill-entertainment">The Fates Conspired Against My Better Treadmill Entertainment</a></h1><time class="post__published">October 8, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>This evening, I went out to grab my mail and, as I was walking that way, noticed that the gym was empty. Having not done my biking the last couple days as should have happened, I decided that a quick jog on the treadmill would be beneficial (especially since the scale is tipping down again).</p>
<p>After quick journey back to the apartment to grab my iPad and shoes, I made my way back towards the gym where I would mooch off some wifi and catch some Parks and Rec courtesy of Netflix. Except that the wifi is either moles asses slow or just plain doesn&#39;t work, because I walked in place in front of a red screen loading for a couple minutes before giving up.</p>
<p>No matter, just about every machine in that room is wired up with cable. Flicking on the TV, I waited through a few commercials to see what channel I was on. Turns out it was the Food Network and it was showing Chopped, one of those god awful reality shows that the former cooking show channel likes to play these days. Because god forbid we&#39;re not entertained by shallow, scripted-through-editing shit TV instead of being educated on how to woo women with succulent dishes. Yes, I&#39;m a little sore that every channel that had mildly educational stuff has gone over to this format (looking at you Discovery Channel, History Channel, The Learning Channel).</p>
<p>But, whatever. I could just change the channel. Except, the channel changing buttons wouldn&#39;t actually change anything. They clearly were doing <em>something</em> because the OSD would come up with the current station number, but it would actually change. At this point, I should have turned off the TV. But I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>I walked/jogged as hippies tried to cook chickens feet for a Halloween themed dish.</p>
<p>Goddammit...</p>

<p>I&#39;m saddened that the red squigglies went away after correcting my spelling of &quot;hashtag&quot;...</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&#39;re coding a website, you&#39;ll have something in markup that is represented in text for accessibility, but needs to be graphical in presentation. Oftentimes, this will happen for a logo or an icon of some sort. The industry standard way of hiding the text but not the image is to use text-indent to move the text somewhere off the left side of the screen while setting a background.</p>
<p>That last part is fine, the other part is not.</p>
<p>When you text-indent something -9999px offscreen, you&#39;re really fucking up the internal render dimensions of the item for the browser. Some dude from Netflix explained more about this on a talk he gave about fixing performance issues on mobile, but I&#39;ll be damned if I can find it now. The short of it is, it&#39;s bad practice, bad for performance, and you shouldn&#39;t do it. But, there&#39;s a nifty, cross-browser friendly way to have your cake without resorting to ugly hacks like text-indent.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I can&#39;t take any credit for any of this. I picked it up from my pal Mickael Lucchini during my first tenure at Griffin. However, I have yet to see this trick used or mentioned anywhere else on the internet, so it needs to be shared.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.image-text</span> {
<span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: [block|inline-block];
<span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-attribute">padding-top</span>: <span class="hljs-number">10px</span>;
<span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">10px</span>;
<span class="hljs-attribute">overflow</span>: hidden;
<span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">url</span>(BACKGROUND_IMAGE);
}
</code></pre>
<p>A quick description of what&#39;s going on:</p>
<p><strong>Line 2</strong> - obviously, seeing as we need to set a height and width, we need a block level element
<strong>Line 3</strong> - we zero out the height of the element to force the content out of the renderable area
<strong>Line 4</strong> - instead, we set our height on the padding which gives the element height and allows the background to show through
<strong>Line 5</strong> - width is set as normal
<strong>Line 6</strong> - because our element height is 0, setting the overflow to hidden will hide the text content within
<strong>Line 7</strong> - finally, set the background, probably a sprite or something</p>
<p>There you have it. Probably the best way to image replace text in a performant and browser friendly way (back to IE6, if I&#39;m not mistaken). If you inspect the search icon up in the corner, you can see this code in action (not sure why the input box is off, but that&#39;s something for another day). Also, if you&#39;re into SASS, here&#39;s a handy mixin I made of the above:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">@mixin image-text($background, $width, $height, $display: block) {
  overflow: hidden;
  width: $width;
  height: 0;
  padding-top: $height;
  display: $display;
  background: $background no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sometime in the mid 90s (I&#39;m inclined to say 1996), garage sale-ing was a popular past time for middle class Americans. It might still be, but I haven&#39;t been in forever. Seems like it&#39;d be fun. But, I digress.</p>
<p>As stated, somewhere in (probably) 1996, we hit up a garage sale a few blocks up from our house. To my kid mind, it was probably the greatest garage sale ever, for there was a veritable treasure trove of old NES games. We wound up leaving that garage sale with three games (and <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/NINTENDO-NES-LOT-OF-10-PLASTIC-HARD-GAME-CASES-/370907101629">some extra cases</a>), one was Gauntlet II, one was some other game I can&#39;t remember, and the third was Star Trek: 25th Anniversary. I grew up on a steady diet of Next Generation growing up, but somehow I was aware of what the original series was and the characters in it. Granted, anything with the name Star Trek in it had to be cool, so I was excited.</p>
<p>And enjoy it I did. It became one of the very few games I played to completion on our old machine, a fact that I was proud of at the time. So, as I&#39;ve been slowly watching TOS at the behest of my boss boss boss, I remembered this game and the feeling of enjoying it quite much. A quick trip to eBay, and I found not only a copy, but a copy with box and manual. That&#39;s a big deal for one who has the tendencies of a collector. For once, though, I actually played the game instead of let it sit and collect dust. And now that I&#39;m done with my long ass intro, the review.

All in all, it was a roaring success.</p>
<h2 id="code-changes">Code Changes</h2>
<p>On the whole, I had developed out the system to be fairly robust on the user facing side by the end of the last bracket. The only real issue remaining there was that the bracket overview was a set of enormous images. This year I fixed that by rendering everything client side as a standard page, with a tiny bit of interactivity sprinkled in (that&#39;s what I linked above). The real work was done on the backend, moving all the administrative code into the model/controllers and out of CLI scripts I had quickly hammered out. That part was an absolute godsend because all I had to do was login and click &quot;advance bracket&quot;. Granted, this could be done on a cron job, but I have to be present to write the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1nts6x/2013_boys_bracket_and_the_winner_is/">recap post</a> anyways. Also, there were almost no technological hiccups this year which made everything so much less stressful.</p>
<h2 id="curbing-abuse">Curbing Abuse</h2>
<p>Last year, there were some groups of users hell bent on getting their character voted in no matter the cost. Because of the rush I was in to get the code out the door, the system was pretty easy to get around in terms of flooding votes. All votes were tied to IP, so you could either get friends to help, go to the library and vote again, or just power cycle your phone. Because everything was IP based, I can&#39;t say how much abuse there was, but I suspect there was a fair amount.</p>
<p>This year, everything was tied to reddit user accounts, using OAuth for authentication. A user would have to have a valid account and that account needed to be at least a month old. I still recorded IPs with the registrations to keep track of multiple users under a single IP. Out of the 660 users who voted, only about a dozen had more than one user to an IP and never more than two. So, another big win.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SLrruty.jpg" alt="" title="An upward trend"></p>
<p>In all, 19841 votes were cast and daily views (seen above) were in the hundreds per day. This really doesn&#39;t even hold a candle to the bracket last year which had ~264000 votes and thousands of views per day. Now, the vote thing can be partially attributed to the above abuse but also the fact that that bracket ran a lot longer. It was 256 characters as opposed to 64. Still, I&#39;m pleased with the turnout. Most voting happend at 5a CDT at 11% of all votes, 6a came in second with 7%, and 2p and 3p were tied for third with 5%. 3a was the quietest time at 2%.</p>
<p>In all, running this bracket was pretty stress free and very much enjoyable. Granted, I wasn&#39;t totally invested being a heterosexual male. But still, everybody else seemed to enjoy it as well and what shit slinging there was was conducted in a civil manner.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not so optimistic for the girls bracket which starts in three weeks...</p>
