<p>I&#39;m saddened that the red squigglies went away after correcting my spelling of &quot;hashtag&quot;...</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&#39;re coding a website, you&#39;ll have something in markup that is represented in text for accessibility, but needs to be graphical in presentation. Oftentimes, this will happen for a logo or an icon of some sort. The industry standard way of hiding the text but not the image is to use text-indent to move the text somewhere off the left side of the screen while setting a background.</p>
<p>That last part is fine, the other part is not.</p>
<p>When you text-indent something -9999px offscreen, you&#39;re really fucking up the internal render dimensions of the item for the browser. Some dude from Netflix explained more about this on a talk he gave about fixing performance issues on mobile, but I&#39;ll be damned if I can find it now. The short of it is, it&#39;s bad practice, bad for performance, and you shouldn&#39;t do it. But, there&#39;s a nifty, cross-browser friendly way to have your cake without resorting to ugly hacks like text-indent.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I can&#39;t take any credit for any of this. I picked it up from my pal Mickael Lucchini during my first tenure at Griffin. However, I have yet to see this trick used or mentioned anywhere else on the internet, so it needs to be shared.</p>
<p>[code=css].image-text {
display: [block|inline-block];
height: 0;
padding-top: 10px;
width: 10px;
overflow: hidden;
background: url(BACKGROUND_IMAGE);
}[/code]</p>
<p>A quick description of what&#39;s going on:</p>
<p><strong>Line 2</strong> - obviously, seeing as we need to set a height and width, we need a block level element
<strong>Line 3</strong> - we zero out the height of the element to force the content out of the renderable area
<strong>Line 4</strong> - instead, we set our height on the padding which gives the element height and allows the background to show through
<strong>Line 5</strong> - width is set as normal
<strong>Line 6</strong> - because our element height is 0, setting the overflow to hidden will hide the text content within
<strong>Line 7</strong> - finally, set the background, probably a sprite or something</p>
<p>There you have it. Probably the best way to image replace text in a performant and browser friendly way (back to IE6, if I&#39;m not mistaken). If you inspect the search icon up in the corner, you can see this code in action (not sure why the input box is off, but that&#39;s something for another day). Also, if you&#39;re into SASS, here&#39;s a handy mixin I made of the above:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">@mixin image-text($background, $width, $height, $display: block) {
  overflow: hidden;
  width: $width;
  height: 0;
  padding-top: $height;
  display: $display;
  background: $background no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sometime in the mid 90s (I&#39;m inclined to say 1996), garage sale-ing was a popular past time for middle class Americans. It might still be, but I haven&#39;t been in forever. Seems like it&#39;d be fun. But, I digress.</p>
<p>As stated, somewhere in (probably) 1996, we hit up a garage sale a few blocks up from our house. To my kid mind, it was probably the greatest garage sale ever, for there was a veritable treasure trove of old NES games. We wound up leaving that garage sale with three games (and <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/NINTENDO-NES-LOT-OF-10-PLASTIC-HARD-GAME-CASES-/370907101629">some extra cases</a>), one was Gauntlet II, one was some other game I can&#39;t remember, and the third was Star Trek: 25th Anniversary. I grew up on a steady diet of Next Generation growing up, but somehow I was aware of what the original series was and the characters in it. Granted, anything with the name Star Trek in it had to be cool, so I was excited.</p>
<p>And enjoy it I did. It became one of the very few games I played to completion on our old machine, a fact that I was proud of at the time. So, as I&#39;ve been slowly watching TOS at the behest of my boss boss boss, I remembered this game and the feeling of enjoying it quite much. A quick trip to eBay, and I found not only a copy, but a copy with box and manual. That&#39;s a big deal for one who has the tendencies of a collector. For once, though, I actually played the game instead of let it sit and collect dust. And now that I&#39;m done with my long ass intro, the review.[break]</p>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XrLsxyk.png" alt="" title="Space... the final frontier..."></p>
<p>The game opens with our intrepid explorers getting sucked into a wormhole or something and thrown out into the other side of the Romulan Neutral Zone. Pretty standard Star Trek fare. About half the game is devoted to getting enough dilithium to go anywhere, and the other half about the anomaly itself. All in all, it&#39;s a pretty short game.</p>
<p>The setup for play is very similar to the old point-and-click adventures of yore, such as those made by Sierra or LucasArts. When on the Enterprise, you get to see out the view screen, talk to various officers, jump around from planet to planet, or beam down to the one you are currently orbiting. In one section, you even battle a Romulan Bird of Prey. When on a planet&#39;s surface, you roam around collecting items, talking to natives, and &quot;tricordering&quot; things. It&#39;s a pretty basic setup that controls well enough given the platform.</p>
<p>One thing that I particularly enjoyed - especially after having been watching the show - was the writing. The dialog for each character is inline with what they&#39;d say in the show, down to Spock&#39;s oft use of &quot;fascinating&quot; or Bones&#39; complaining that he isn&#39;t a <insert profession here>. On top of that characters, locales, and even story lines are revisited from the show. The Gorn and Harry Mudd both make an appearance, and (spoiler alert) the entire plot line of the game hinges on the ending of <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/A_Piece_of_the_Action_(episode">&quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;</a>). They even slingshot around a sun to go back in time, a not so subtle nod to my favorite TOS movie, <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek_IV:_The_Voyage_Home">The Voyage Home</a>. The cherry on top is the ending where Spock and Bones are standing around the captain&#39;s chair as Spock says something profoundly illogical but tries to play it off. Good shit.</p>

<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Cro5nvy.png" alt="" title="Spock. Myy... arm! Is so... TINY!"></p>
<p>Given the limited abilities of the NES in terms of graphics, I have to give props to this game for both conveying the feel of the Star Trek sets while also pulling off a couple of nifty technical feats. One in particular had me scratching my head a bit, knowing what I know about the NES hardware thanks to the knowledge I picked up while writing my emulator.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6HL1gAw.png" alt="" title="Just another desolate planet"></p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to overlook if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking for, but Kirk is standing in front of the shrubbery and behind the rocks. Unlike the SNES, the NES only had one background layer and a sprite could be flagged as in front of or behind that one background layer. When I first noticed this I was all &quot;what is this devilry?&quot; The simple answer would be that the items in front of Kirk were just sprites pretending to be the background, but a lack of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Limitations#Fighting">sprite flicker</a> quickly rules that out. What they must be doing is paying very close attention to where each &quot;subsprite&quot; of the player sprite is in relation to the background (I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re running in 8x16 sprite mode), and setting that part above/below the background as needed. It&#39;s a pretty clever way to add some depth.</p>
<p>But, all is not sunshine and roses, despite the cleverness. The limitations of the 2C02 come blazing forth, with slowdown when there are too many sprites on screen, or the aforementioned flicker when Jim and his buddies are all standing on the same scanline. Some of the static characters look a little bit &quot;muddy&quot; and don&#39;t stand out too well from the background at times. But, they&#39;re trying to make something &quot;realistic&quot; out of a super limited palette, so I can let these instances slide.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/voZh0Cu.png" alt="" title="Spock seems to be smiling..."></p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>You have to give credit to anybody that can create a good chiptune. The guys at Capcom had it down to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF32DRg9opA">fucking science</a>. Granted, creating an original score is a lot simpler than trying to arrange an existing piece for a few triangle waves, a square, and a noise channel. Still, it can be done <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roHje14-K44">with great success.</a> This game, while it does incorporate themes and background tunes from the show, tends to be very barebones and the loops are super short. The gangster theme in particular gets really annoying pretty quickly. But, you have to give them props for keeping it &quot;in the family&quot;, as it were.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not ten anymore and am not so easily amused as I once was, but I feel that this game has actually held up really well. You can tell that the guys who made it had a great deal of respect for the source material, ensuring that the characters and story telling that we all have come to know and love were represented as accurately as possible. Yes, the game is short (about four-five hours), the music could be better, and there were a couple instances where figuring out what to do next was a bit tricky (GameFaqs was on tap a couple times), but I genuinely enjoyed revisiting this game some seventeen years after first being introduced to it. That I&#39;m now more familiar with the series now only makes it even better.</p>
<p>You should take some notes, J.J. Abrams. THIS is how to write a love letter to the 23rd century.</p>

All in all, it was a roaring success.</p>
<h2 id="code-changes">Code Changes</h2>
<p>On the whole, I had developed out the system to be fairly robust on the user facing side by the end of the last bracket. The only real issue remaining there was that the bracket overview was a set of enormous images. This year I fixed that by rendering everything client side as a standard page, with a tiny bit of interactivity sprinkled in (that&#39;s what I linked above). The real work was done on the backend, moving all the administrative code into the model/controllers and out of CLI scripts I had quickly hammered out. That part was an absolute godsend because all I had to do was login and click &quot;advance bracket&quot;. Granted, this could be done on a cron job, but I have to be present to write the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1nts6x/2013_boys_bracket_and_the_winner_is/">recap post</a> anyways. Also, there were almost no technological hiccups this year which made everything so much less stressful.</p>
<h2 id="curbing-abuse">Curbing Abuse</h2>
<p>Last year, there were some groups of users hell bent on getting their character voted in no matter the cost. Because of the rush I was in to get the code out the door, the system was pretty easy to get around in terms of flooding votes. All votes were tied to IP, so you could either get friends to help, go to the library and vote again, or just power cycle your phone. Because everything was IP based, I can&#39;t say how much abuse there was, but I suspect there was a fair amount.</p>
<p>This year, everything was tied to reddit user accounts, using OAuth for authentication. A user would have to have a valid account and that account needed to be at least a month old. I still recorded IPs with the registrations to keep track of multiple users under a single IP. Out of the 660 users who voted, only about a dozen had more than one user to an IP and never more than two. So, another big win.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SLrruty.jpg" alt="" title="An upward trend"></p>
<p>In all, 19841 votes were cast and daily views (seen above) were in the hundreds per day. This really doesn&#39;t even hold a candle to the bracket last year which had ~264000 votes and thousands of views per day. Now, the vote thing can be partially attributed to the above abuse but also the fact that that bracket ran a lot longer. It was 256 characters as opposed to 64. Still, I&#39;m pleased with the turnout. Most voting happend at 5a CDT at 11% of all votes, 6a came in second with 7%, and 2p and 3p were tied for third with 5%. 3a was the quietest time at 2%.</p>
<p>In all, running this bracket was pretty stress free and very much enjoyable. Granted, I wasn&#39;t totally invested being a heterosexual male. But still, everybody else seemed to enjoy it as well and what shit slinging there was was conducted in a civil manner.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not so optimistic for the girls bracket which starts in three weeks...</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/edge-cases">Edge Cases</a></h2><time>October 4, 2013</time><div><p>I&#39;m grasping at straws on what I should post, especially given that I have thirty minutes to write something. I thought I was doing well by actually <em>having</em> a post whereas my dear sweet mother had not, but a quick check reveals <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2013/10/oh-crap-i-have-to-write-another-post/">that she&#39;s on top of her game</a>, probably with quality.</p>
<p>Browsing through my pictures folder, I came across a few things involving redditbooru&#39;s reverse image search. At this point, the thing is an essential tool for the /r/awwnime sub, and when it doesn&#39;t work, I get notified. I&#39;ve <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">mentioned before</a> that the image analysis is entirely color based, no edge or corner detection or anything like that. So, when somebody brings up something and my human mind is all &quot;huh, it seems like that should have matched&quot;, I&#39;m invariably sent down a rabbit hole of figuring shit out.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhf9.jpg" alt="" title="Taiga..."></p>
<p>This was the first one I had to deeply investigate. The one on the left was the original, repost on the right. It should be noted that the right picture was also animated. The images are squashed because all images are resized to 256x256 to help normalize things, especially useful for taking into account resized pictures. But, the image search failed to pick up on this for a couple reasons: A) the gif is ever so slightly brighter, probably due to the color quantization. Actually, that&#39;s really the only thing. The ever so slight facial expression difference would almost certainly be picked up if the color space was the same.</p>
<p>We had some discussion on the thread about whether testing against greyscale would be any help, but the difference was enough that it didn&#39;t bring the matches any closer.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhfa.jpg" alt="" title="Skyfaaaaall"></p>
<p>This one was fun. The above picture is the original, the repost I have no idea where it is, but I have some explanation images.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhfb.jpg" alt="" title="Slight differences"></p>
<p>The left side in this case is the repost and you can tell that there are some slight differences in both form and colors, certainly enough to throw off the image search. What I had trouble wrapping my mind around was that these were clearly two different images, but which one was the original and why was there one slightly different.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhfc.png" alt="" title="Overlayed comparison"></p>
<p>Turns out, the slightly shittier left version (not saying it&#39;s shitty, it&#39;s certainly kicking my ass and most of my other body parts at art) was somebody copying the original in an attempt to improve their art skills.</p>
<p>That&#39;s cool. I&#39;ve been there too.</p>
