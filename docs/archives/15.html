<h2 id="february-5th-2015">February 5th, 2015</h2>
<ol>
<li>Went to work today</li>
<li>Larger breakfast because everything looked good.</li>
<li>Made coffee. Then drank it</li>
<li>Refactored touch code to be more modular. Such tedium, decent results.</li>
<li>What the fuck, Nick? I get that it&#39;s nutella day, but I&#39;m trying to lose weight.</li>
<li>Doubled my morning water intake because I was thirsty</li>
<li>Salad with tuna for lunch. Such sadness</li>
<li>Leave work early to await my piano delivery</li>
<li>Oh, it&#39;s already here. And the stand is here too</li>
<li>&quot;Hey, guy. My name is Mr. Headache. Let me throb for a while&quot;.</li>
<li>Fuck you, Mr. Headache.</li>
<li>Still waiting for the piano pedals, but it&#39;s good to be playing things again.</li>
</ol>
<p>That almost felt therapeutic.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>2014 Micro Retrospectives - Programming</h2><time>January 4, 2015</time><div><p>Getting back to that thing I was doing, today I&#39;ll cover last year&#39;s coding efforts. And what efforts those were. Actually, I think 2014 might be my most active year ever. Just going by GitHub, I totaled over 670 commits. Of course, that doesn&#39;t include anything I did at work (and there was certainly a lot of that). So what exactly happened last year?</p>
<h2 id="redditbooru-v2">RedditBooru v2</h2>
<p>This is <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/systems-architecture-in-the-unknown/">pretty</a> well <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/redditbooru-v2-postmortem/">documented</a>. January was spent rewriting basically everything as I attempted to port RedditBooru to nodejs. Then, when that didn&#39;t pan out how I wanted, went back to the original PHP stack with major modifications to the existing codebase. The new feature set in v2 wasn&#39;t the huge success I expected it to be (though, my bandwidth nearly doubled overnight). Indeed, views have been steadily dropping, though I think this is partially due to better RES integration that came along. Still, 875k page views by 214k unique users is pretty good and more than I would have anticipated anything I&#39;d ever create would do. But, that doesn&#39;t even begin to compare to...</p>
<h2 id="anime-bracket">Anime Bracket</h2>
<p>Some interesting stuff happened here (that is actually pending a full write up). In August, a user on the anime subreddit contacted me about using the awwnime bracket site for a bracket he wanted to do. I said yes, pulled some code strings, and let him on his merry way. Long story short, that bracket garnered over 1 million page views and 2.5 million votes by 24k registered users. Here&#39;s a fun little image showing the difference between that bracket and the one I usually run in the fall:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jnda7fE.jpg" alt="" title="That tall peak is 45k users in one day"></p>
<p>That kickstarted an effort by me to make the bracket accessible to anybody (because it has also proved to be financially sustainable). Indeed, as I write this, I&#39;m taking a break from <a href="http://beta.brakk.it/">working on the new site</a>. But, more details on that later.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>As usual, those two projects continue to be my main concern while not at work. However, that&#39;s not all I&#39;ve done. There was the aforementioned contributions to RES updating support for RedditBooru albums. There was also the work I did on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoghOn8Abs8">awwnime bracket app</a>. I also did some work around my <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/HueHueHueNET/tree/master/HueController">Hue lights</a> and a couple of other <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/HedonismSlackBot">trifling</a> <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/ScreensAgainstHumanity">things</a> that didn&#39;t gain traction. Of course, that&#39;s not including the stuff that I don&#39;t commit (and I do a lot of small scripts just to help out with day-to-day life).</p>
<p>Alright, so there&#39;s another post.</p>
