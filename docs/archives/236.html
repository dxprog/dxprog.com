Today, day one of house-on-the-market-dom, an investor came by to look at the place. As I write this we have no idea what his thoughts are, but the fact that it's only been a day is promising.

In programming land I downloaded every pattern from ACC and am having fun fiddling with that data. First I converted it all into pattern data (a string 1024 bytes long using hex numbers for image data) and yesterday a wrote a little compression algorithm. It's similar to BMPs RLE compression and just about halved the size of the file. I'm not sure what I'll do with the stuff now. I may lump it all into a database and build a viewer around it (it would be nice if the guy who ran ACC liked it and hired me to write the ASP version).

Well, we're going to be eating lunch so that's all I'll write for today. Heck, maybe the next entry will be written from our new house (would be nice). Cheers :-)</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/erg">Erg</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 6, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content">Well, I got my games today (after an eternity of waiting) and surprise, surprise they're pirated copies :-@. I'm hoping I can get a refund and if I can't get that I hope at least that these games won't fritz on me immediatly. But, my ALttP cart (which I learned is also pirated) hasn't gone nutzy on me yet, so maybe if I'm lucky I'll still be playing these when I'm 50 :-P.

I've finished with my changes to the [parish site](http://www.parishofstpeter.net). I had a fun journey into RSS land and the nightmares of PHP's XML handling came back to haunt me as well :-P. I also decided to put up scanned copies of the bulletin due to the format changes it undergoes each week. It makes me look like a hypocrite because a couple weeks ago the guy who runs the Our Lady of Guadelupe site was on my case for not getting the bulletin up-to-date and was talking about how he just scanned theirs in. I stupidly answered "Nah, that's cheating. I couldn't do that." Well, I did it. However, in my defense, I have a high quality, lossless scan whereas his, well, [you make the call](http://www.ourladyofguadalupe-dewey.org/bulletin.htm).

This afternoon mom and I are going to look at houses (my opinion is highly valued ;-)). With any luck we'll find something spacious enough for us at a decent price. Maybe tomorrow I'll post on how all that went, but until then...</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/erg">Erg</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 6, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Well, I got my games today (after an eternity of waiting) and surprise, surprise they&#39;re pirated copies :-@.

I'm currently being considered for a job at Gamespot/TV.com/MP3.com doing web work for them. Now that in itself is cool but it would mean relocating to San Fransico (a good several hundred miles from here). It's kind of an exciting thought, though. Finally making my own money, putting aside worries of my future at least for the time being.

In other news, I'm getting the parish site up to speed again (basically the last job that really needs to be done) and I'm going to rewrite my GBA bowling program. I've been trying to think of a game to write, but it hasn't been coming lately. Oh well.

I've been having some nasty hankering to play old Mario World again (probably thanks to my last write up). So, after collecting some money from VB.NET, I bought it for my beloved GBA :-). Of course, you can't have Mario World 1 without Mario World 2 (aka Yoshi's Island) so I got it too :-). Now my game collection should be complete (though Mario Kart would be fun and the Wario Ware games look like a blast :-D).

And, this just in, we finally found a AC adapter for the old keyboard and now I can start teaching myself how to play :-).

Well, I shall sign off for the night. Maybe next time I'll put up my next autobiographical installment.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/the-canon-to-real-life">The Canon to Real Life</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 27, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It seems I may be launched from my protective shelter at home with my family right into &quot;real&quot; life soon (what is &quot;real&quot;? ;-)).
