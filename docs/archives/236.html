<p>In the mean time I am recovering from a... ahem... computer problem. I shall just say this: don&#39;t go around deleting things unless you are absolutely, one hundred precent sure they don&#39;t have some sort of low-level hook into your system. And on top of that don&#39;t go stopping services unless you are completely certain you aren&#39;t going to need it. So, yeah.</p>
<p>That all said I won&#39;t be having a comic up today. I&#39;ll probably put something up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Okay, first of all I&#39;m really ticked at myself for spelling crystal wrong in the comic title. Oh, well, I&#39;m too lazy to change it now :-P.</p>
<p>The idea behind this is pretty self-explanitory. Oh, an Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is a darn fun game (not to mention probably the prettiest game I&#39;ve ever seen).</p>
<p>But that&#39;s about all I have to say about that.</p>
