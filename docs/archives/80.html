I was reading through old entries last night and I feel that things may be beginning to get empty. So, here I am once again poring forth my soul into the void that is known as the internet.</p>
<p>Last month ended my two month journey that was motion graphics. I am sad to have to leave these classes as I seem to have found my calling in mograph. To be frank, I had way too much fun and I probably created my best work ever in those two months. Of course, just because I&#39;m not in the class doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be dropping it and forgetting about it. No, I plan on doing small projects through out school that I can dump into my demo reel down. Even now I am working on a small advertisement for a friend. After that, there&#39;s a Dockers &quot;make your commercial and have it aired on TV&quot; contest that I&#39;m thinking of entering. The more I can get my work out there, the more chance I have of going immediately into the industry after I graduate.</p>
<p>But enough dwelling on the past (or the future), and let us reflect on the present. This month I have probably what is going to be the easiest class off all time: web development. For anybody who doesn&#39;t know me personally, I&#39;ve been involved in web dev for going on eight years. All that YPN stuff and what not. Of course, for those of us who are already fluent in web dev they&#39;re going to try to get us to use modern and clean coding practices (tableless design, emphasis on CSS, etc). Oh, wait. I already do all that. I feel like a jerk talking about this class like it&#39;s useless crap, but it&#39;s really not their fault. However, I don&#39;t want to be talked down to as if I know nothing or am new to the whole web stuff. As with most technologies I&#39;ve taught myself, I not only learn forwards, but backwards as well. I&#39;m well versed in tricks of old as well as new. Alright, enough of that borderline ego stroking.</p>
<p>My other class, which I haven&#39;t actually attended yet, is, or will be, developmental psychology. I really don&#39;t know what this class has in store for me, but at the very least it should be more interesting than web dev.</p>
<p>Today, I got to get my feet wet in the field of game testing. EA&#39;s Tiburon division, which develops most of their sports titles, resides just seven small miles from my house. Once or twice a month they bring people in to do a couple hours of game beta testing in exchange for a free game. I&#39;ve been on the mailing list since December after Ian Cummings, lead director of the Madden series, put in a recommendation for me after reading my Rock Band drums post. Of course, that was for a full-time job doing game testing, but being a full-time student as well these two hours sessions were the next best thing. But, I digress.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got to go to the EA building, which I must say is very, very nice looking. I even got to sign a non-disclosure agreement that forbids me from telling anybody what I played or what I saw. Kind of cool, actually. I will say, I enjoyed what I played and the best part of all is I obtained myself a free copy of Command &amp; Conquer 3 for PC. I haven&#39;t actually installed or tried the game yet, but I&#39;ll probably post something when I do.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that about wraps things up for now. I&#39;ll be putting up a post about my final project for motion graphics soon (currently waiting on something). Oh, and for all those tiny little updates be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dxprog">Twitter account</a>. I&#39;ve also placed a convenient little box above the RSS feeds that shows my latest tweet. Until next time, keep your staplers running.</p>

<p>Not going to put a whole bunch of useless text on this one, however I will explain things a bit. This is yet another project for motion graphics. The criteria on this one was to create a commercial for a demographic outside of my own. So, I decided to market Full Sail to women (because we don&#39;t have near enough). Enjoy.</p>

Hard to believe it&#39;s already been half a year. Time does fly when you&#39;re having fun. But that&#39;s hardly why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>For MGR, our final project was to create a magazine layout and thirty second animation for a product, service, etc. I had a few ideas for mine before settling on something that was close to me: Crayola crayons. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve never really touched much on my artistic background, but I&#39;ve always had a box of Crayons crayons handy. I can remember buying crayons with my birthday money (it was the only time I ever had any) many times. Also, whenever we&#39;d take a trip to visit my grandparents I&#39;d always be drawing stuff with a bowl of crayons that my Grandma would set out. Even now, sitting next to me on my desk is a box of 64 Crayolas, and they&#39;re not unused either. And, for the record, those other brands aren&#39;t really crayons. Crayola&#39;s have a distinct smell, texture, and feel that has not been duplicated by anybody else. I don&#39;t mind spending a little extra for them. Upon opening the box and getting a whiff, I am suddenly a little kid, lying on the floor doodling and day dreaming away as only the innocent can.</p>
<p>But, enough of the schmaltzy stuff. Before you can watch the video you must see the ad. It kind of sets the mood.</p>

<p>And, now, for the coup de gracie. Enjoy!</p>

<p>As of the beginning of this month I began my foray into the wondrous world that is motion graphics. Our first project was to make a ten second bumper advertising ourselves or a &quot;company&quot; that represented ourselves. I was originally going to use my name and try to brand myself as myself, but it was advised by an instructor that I brand myself under a pseudonym, at least for the remainder of school, so as to have something that gives a lasting impression. I decided to play off of my more or less established internet moniker, dxprog, and came up with dx productions. Grab yourself some popcorn and prepare to be sold my awesomeness.</p>
