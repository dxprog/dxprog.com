I am currently at Orlando International where I await the departure of my flight at 6:23am, a little less than six hours from now. I was hoping to walk in here, dump off my luggage, and get through security right off the bat. However, good old Northwest Airlines has, yet again, left me with an unmanned counter. So, I am stuck with my twenty pound bag of clothing and vigilantly watching for the first signs of life at the counter.</p>
<p>Once again I have finished another two courses at Full Sail. This time was Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Math (CMD) which was basically an Algebra course.</p>
<p>DAT was alright; it was essentially a traditional art course with design centric properties. Not being able to use my computer was difficult for me especially because pencils and paper don&#39;t have the Ctl+Z option. If you screw up, you&#39;ve screwed up. Congratulations. However, I did pump out some decent stuff which I will show to you now.</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Rock-Band-Still-Life-72758916"><img src="http://www.deviantart.com/download/72758916/Rock_Band_Still_Life_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="image"></a>
This is my fice piece still life. I pushed it a little bit by counting the drum sticks as seperate objects, but meh. It went ungraded anyways (as did most things in that class).</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Master-Chief-in-the-Moonlight-72758650"><img src="http://www.deviantart.com/download/72758650/Master_Chief_Painting_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="image"></a>
This is the only piece I am truly proud of. I don&#39;t really have much to say aside from it was painted with acrylics on canvas and it was my first time doing any painting outside of using Crayola watercolors. The colors are a little dark because mixing paints is a bitch.</p>
<p>I did do several other pieces, but I don&#39;t have pictures of them and seeing as I&#39;m at the airport I won&#39;t be taking pictures anytime soon.</p>
<p>Nothing really to report on about math because that&#39;s exactly what it was. What is sweet, though, is that I may pull an A out of that class which would thrill me to no end as I thought math was my suckiest subject.</p>
<p>So, there&#39;s my month on a nutshell. I&#39;ll probably post again once I&#39;m in ol&#39; Bartlesville. Until then, keep on peacin&#39; out!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/wecome-to-relaunch-5-0">Welcome to Relaunch 5.0!</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 20, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Not sure if that version number is correct or not, but it seems about right.</p>
<p>So, yes, here is the new design. It&#39;s not the same one I was working on <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/redesign-the-reason/">back in October</a>. No, it&#39;s better. I was actually going to use this for my final project in Fabian&#39;s class (NOS), but he borked his server and essentially axed the entire set up a blog requirement. I do owe him a lot for this design as it was his, shall we say, technique that inspired me. Design aside, this is the easiest transition to new design/engine I&#39;ve ever had (thanks in no small part to the fact that I reused the current database structure).</p>
<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to blog right now. I&#39;m going to be returning to good old Bartlesville for Christmas in a few days. Perhaps I&#39;ll write something then. In case I don&#39;t say it in time, I hope everybody has a Kick Ass Christmas!</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, I added tagging. Maybe I&#39;ll add a tag cloud later.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/site-upgrades:-now-with-more-caching">Site upgrades: Now with more caching</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 3, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I have culled some scripting from my WIP site to add database caching support to the current scripts. I&#39;ve been noticing lately that the database has been having trouble keeping up with the higher demand so that is why I rushed this out the door. Overall things are much faster, however, information is only pulled from the database once an hour so there&#39;s going to be a delay between, say, somebody adding a comment and it actually showing up on the page. This bug will not plague the next iteration which is set to roll out within the next two weeks.</p>

In the last post I said I was going to make a GlovePIE script, but it seems I have been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIre8qkQIvs">beaten to the punch</a>. You&#39;ll find the script in the description of the linked video and I can confirm that it works with the 360 drum kit.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/good-bye-vacation">Good-bye vacation</a></h1><time class="post__published">November 26, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>A wise man once said all good things must come to an end. So it is true for me as my week long Thanksgiving vacation is over effective 8:00AM EST tomorrow morning. However, I will certainly say that it has been a rather interesting week for me.</p>
<p>There is, of course, my <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/hack-rock-band-drums-to-work-with-windows-marvel-at-them-working-with-windows-55562.phtml">obvious</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/23/use-the-rock-band-drums-with-your-pc/">return</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/22/rock-band-drum-kit-hacked-for-windows/">to</a> <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/clip/rock-band-drums-work-on-pc-326030.php">fame</a> thanks in no small part to idle curiosity and a couple minutes of nifty text editing. And to those who&#39;ve been messing around with the drums program from the prior post, I have been paying attention to your comments. At this point I&#39;ve abandoned that program in lieu of a GlovePIE script. More on that as things unfold.</p>
<p>An interesting development that spun off of all that hype was a small little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/welcome-to-the-brawl-of-the-century/#comments">comment</a> left on a completely unrelated topic. It was from a producer at EA who basically said &quot;Hey, want to do some game testing now and maybe come work for us after college?&quot; When I first read that my small appartment was filled with whooping and jumping (this was before I got sick, more on that in a minute). It would be completely awesome if this were to pan out for me. Not only would I get some extra cash on the side while still in school, but I could go straight from graduation right into the industry that I&#39;ve always dreamed of working in.</p>
<p>This whole thing is a perfect testimony to what I&#39;ve been told by many people: throw yourself out there, you never know who&#39;s looking. I&#39;ve been slowly working on my online presence since I joined YPN in January of &#39;02. Since then I&#39;ve dipped into almost every kind of online media there is. From running a message board, to podcasting, to online videos. Basically what I&#39;m trying to say is, if you&#39;ve got something that you think is good, put up online and do a little bit of shameless advertising. If I can come this far with one little video and a tip suggestion to Engadget and Joystiq there&#39;s no reason why anybody else can&#39;t. /end soapbox moment</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, I am &quot;sick&quot;. I put it in quotes because it&#39;s not as bad as my usual form of sickness. Usually I get a sore throat, runny, feel weak, and just downright terrible over all. This, however, is confined mainly to the sore throat combined with a little bit of hoarse voice. Luckily, with the exception of the throat I feel physically fine. I was well enough to bike up to school today to pick up the books for my next wave of classes, namely Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Mathematics (CMD).</p>
<p>DAT looks to be rather interesting as it is basically a traditional art class (no computers) with a design oriented twist. I&#39;ve heard from two sources now that we&#39;re going to be getting a large amount of art supplies so that&#39;ll be cool. CMD is basic math up through intermediate Algebra. I jumped to the middle of my book and was able to figure out what was going on so I&#39;m feeling pretty confident about that. Plus, I got a free Algebric calculator, though I doubt I&#39;ll ever use it. I usually do all my problem solving on paper.</p>
<p>Well, I feel I&#39;ve rambled on enough. Before I go I just want to give a quick shout out to any new readers I may have picked up through the hulla-balloo. Peace out.</p>
