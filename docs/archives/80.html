So, here it is. The new headers I think give the site a more full-bodied experience and the word &quot;Blog&quot; there tells you exactly what you&#39;re looking at... you know, in case you&#39;re dumb or something.</p>

<p>I continue my little comic rampage with this installment. I&#39;m not thrilled with the artwork but I love the writing so it balances out in the end. A little bit of TMI here, but I got this idea whilst showering. Goes to show you, ideas will come at just about anytime.</p>

<p>Stay tuned next week when Tom Nook is hanged for his unforgivable crimes.</p>

<p>Holy fish, Batman! Two comics within a week! As can be seen my inks have vastly improved over my last <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/196367/">endeavor</a>. I&#39;m really pleased with how this turned out. Even the musculature looks decent. The only thing lacking, and this goes for most all my comics, is the lack of background scenery in panels 1 and 4. But I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p>Oh, since you can probably get Crackdown cheap at used game stores, you should pick up a copy. It&#39;s an awesome game. I actually had more fun playing that than I did the Halo 3 beta (mainly because I suck at Halo).</p>

Of course, that&#39;s a mouthful of words right there so their brilliant marketing team reduced it down to &quot;bogo&quot;. However, when spelled back out it&#39;s Buy One Get One which is clearly a lie. It should be &quot;bogoho&quot;, but then I guess it sounds like some black guy ordering his prositutes around. Yo! Bo go, ho!</p>
