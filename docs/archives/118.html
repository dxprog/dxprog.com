I was, at one point, going to film several little skits or vignettes about the untimely demise of Peeps, but really only finished one. However, for the first time ever, you can see the unfinished, unreleased opening!</p>

Fun fact: the fat kid in the commercial - my brother Chris - is very not fat now.</p>
