Brackets in general are a very math heavy thing, full of all sorts of logistical and statistical related calculations. Setting up a bracket per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports">standard sports seeding</a>) was a bit of a fun nut to crack by itself. However, the interesting problems have been the ones relating to issues cropping up while the bracket&#39;s running.</p>
<p>Eliminations and actual user voting began last Saturday and was off to a pretty good start. The next day had an even better turnout. And so it&#39;s continued.</p>
<p>Day 1 - 7054 votes, 370 users
Day 2 - 9947 votes, 623 users
Day 3 - 11512 votes, 647 users
Day 4 - 12956 votes, 680 users
Day 5 - 13731 votes, 816 users
Day 6 (in progress) - 14799 votes, 1005 users</p>
<p>As can be seen, each day has had quite a bit of increased turnout over the previous day and the trend doesn&#39;t seem to be stopping. This has brought around the very real problem of girls in the first day suddenly having very low vote counts compared to those in the later days.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s where math comes in.</p>
<p>To help normalize all the votes against each other, each girl has her votes calculated as a percentage of her day&#39;s votes. This is then applied against the day that had the highest number of votes:</p>
<p>adjusted = round((characterVotes / dayVotes) * maxVotes);</p>
<p>(Yes, I&#39;m aware that those extra parenthesis are superfluous thanks to order of operations)</p>
<p>So, now each girl can be correctly ranked against how well she did within her own group and not just as an overall sum.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-anime-bracket-my-other-fulltime-job">The Anime Bracket, My Other Full-time Job</a></h1><time class="post__published">October 28, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Last Saturday, the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/">2013 Awwnime Girls Bracket</a> opened for business for the second year. The first phase of the brackets always sucks because it means a lot of tedious labor for me.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consists of people nominating the characters they&#39;d like to see make it to the actual voting. This year, I put a lot of additional rules in place, limiting the time span from which somebody could enter a character. This was done to give new characters a fighting change, keep things fresh, and also (hopefully) shrink the pool.</p>
<p>Well, that didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>As of me writing this, three days into the seven day long nomination period, there have been over 1500 nominations. I have had to go through each and every one of those and, for the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-girls-bracket/characters/">830 nominees that were eligible and not duplicates</a>, clean up the name and create a thumbnails. A few things have made this slightly easier this year than last.</p>
<ul>
<li>Better admin tools</li>
<li>A requirement that the user provide an image of the character so I don&#39;t have to go hunting for one</li>
<li>A type-ahead field that pulls data from <a href="http://myanimelist.com">MyAnimeList</a> that will prefill character name, media source, and image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MAL images always come in a 225x350 size, so I&#39;ve gotten the cropping down to muscle memory; I can complete an entrants record in under 10 seconds. Which is good, because even at ten seconds per, that&#39;s over two hours of solid work. But, the average is much higher because I still sometimes need to find a better picture, figure out if the character is eligible if I&#39;m not familiar with the source, etc and so forth. I&#39;ve probably put five to six hours into just cropping those fucking pictures.</p>
<p>But, still, I&#39;m happy with the turn out. To give you a bit of comparison, last year when there were no restricting rules, there were a total of 797 nominations of which 473 made it into the elimination rounds. I suspect part of that is due to the fact that this bracket is starting out with the traction we had at the end of the last one. But also, a lot of people are just nominating every female character from their favorite shows, regardless of how much actual screen time they may have had. I personally think this is a silly approach because only 256 characters will make it to the actual bracket and those will all be the heavy hitter characters. I mean, who seriously thinks that <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/z4.jpg">this</a> will win against <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/ln.jpg">this</a> on a battle based upon cuteness?</p>
<p>Not me, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

It&#39;s become a bad habit for sure.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ovHy1omh.jpg" alt="" title="Staxxx of anime"></p>
<p>On the left is the pile of shows I&#39;ve seen, but not from the versions I&#39;ve purchased. To be fair, the Lucky Star and Haruhi boxes were double dips; I already owned the complete series sets, but Amazon was selling the big ones for $3 (thanks for going out of business, Bandai). On the right are the shows I&#39;ve seen only partially or not at all. A bunch of it I got during RightStuf&#39;s Christmas sale last year (I&#39;m a sucker for deals).</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mje5.jpg" alt="" title="Don&#39;t play games with my heart"></p>
<p>Moving on to games, there are far less than the above movies/anime. Granted, this doesn&#39;t take into account my Steam collection. Still, a few items here fall into &quot;haven&#39;t completed on this particular media&quot; category, namely the Famicom games. Lego Indiana Jones I only purchased to hack my Wii U, so I doubt I&#39;ll ever play that at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8PTyXBgh.jpg" alt="" title="Books, check &#39;em out!"></p>
<p>You may recall some of these from my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/unjacking-from-the-matrix-an-experiment/">no internet experiment</a> last year. Well, many have gone unread and more have been added since. The Haganai book I only got a couple days ago, so perhaps that one counts less. Making matters worse, however, is the enormous stack of Japanese literature I&#39;ve acquired for that magical day when I can comprehend the language. I can <em>read</em> most of these (when there are furigana for the kanji), but I can&#39;t understand 99.97% of them. I have leafed through them all a fair amount, though, and a couple are really only art books.</p>
<p>So, it appears I have a problem pouring money into my hobbies and then not actually following up on them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this should be my new years challenge... to have done <em>before</em> 2014...</p>
