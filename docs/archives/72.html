Recently, while making some additions to the <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/smp/">Music Page</a>, I came across the need to get the location of a YouTube FLV. Unfortunately, most of my googling turned up outdated results that no longer work. Fortunately, unlike a certain <a href="http://hulu.com/">other</a> site, it&#39;s not impossible. Below is a quick explanation of what I got to work. I&#39;ll be assuming that you know how to get your hands on the video ID (the &quot;v&quot; parameter in the query string).

<p>One thing that I&#39;ve attempted to take up again is drawing. My skills currently sit somewhere between mediocre and decent, a stat I&#39;d certainly like to level up. So, my brother Chris and I have periodically enjoyed an evening of drawing while watching the nerdy sitcom, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">Big Bang Theory</a>. Unfortunately, we&#39;ve finished the first two seasons and now are forced to wait a week for new episodes, as the third season just began. For the off days, BBT has been summarily replaced with Pinky and the Brain.</p>
<p>In keeping with my new found - and probably unhealthy - fascination with the land of the rising sun, I&#39;ve been taking cues from the manga/anime style (much of which is fan art). So, for those who enjoy that sort of thing, here&#39;s a gallery of some of the artwork I&#39;ve created over the lest month and a half.</p>
<p>[gallery=Summer 2009 Art]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Konata.jpg" alt="" title="Konata Izumi from Lucky Star. My first crack at getting back into drawing and, arguably, the worst"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Tsukasa.jpg" alt="" title="Tsukasa Hiiragi. Another piece of fanart from Lucky Star. This has replaced my long standing Yoko desktop wallpper."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Midori_sketch.jpg" alt="" title="Midori Kasugano of Midori Days. Probably the most bizarre premise to a story I&#39;ve yet encountered, but it was funny and endearing; a throughly enjoyable read/watch."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Keri.jpg" alt="" title="A character of my own devise. I named her Keri."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Haruhi.jpg" alt="" title="Haruhi Suzumiya. Probably one of the best sci-fi/highschool mash-ups I&#39;ve ever seen. Well, the only one I&#39;ve seen."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nia_sketch.jpg" alt="" title="Nia... somebody, straight out of Gurren Laggan. This anime kicked the BallZ right out of Dragon Ball">[/gallery]</p>
<p>So, there it is. You probably noticed that there&#39;s a bit of a common theme to the above pictures (beyond the manga/anime thing). If you didn&#39;t, you lose five points and get no cookie.</p>

<p>This is just a quick color job of a sketch I did a couple days ago. I hold that of all the anime I&#39;ve watched ad manga I&#39;ve read, Haruhi is by far the hottest character I&#39;ve encountered. Or, in the immortal words of the famous Solid Snake, &quot;Oh my God, hotness. I wanna bang you!&quot;</p>

Over the past few days, I&#39;ve been developing a library to help in drawing graphs for various stuff on the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page">music page</a>. I&#39;ve built to to be a fairly complete solution that is both robust and simple to use. Today, I offer phpGraphs to the masses to do with as they please, <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/phpGraphs_1.0.zip">free of charge.</a> Follow the break for a quick tutorial on how to use it.

It has been my pet project for a year now and has been the catalyst for a few leaps in coding practice for me. Firstly, it&#39;s responsible for my becoming quite adept at advanced &quot;OOP&quot;-like JavaScript-ing. Secondly, it&#39;s given me an outlet to try out new things such as dynamic graphs in PHP or using Bing&#39;s search API. Let&#39;s take a brief walk through history.
