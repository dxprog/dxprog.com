<p>[quote]Over half way in and my resolve to not turn on the computer is holding. Still, I wonder often how the karma seeds I planted over the weekend are doing. I am far too concerned with this arbitrary number...</p>
<p>Finished both the Hobbit and Madoka 2 tonight. This was probably my most enjoyable read of the Hobbit, knowing the story of LotR and also just being old enough to understand it all. Still, I found Tolkien&#39;s prose to be a highly annoying in places. His odd phrasings and lack of correct comma usage made some bits difficult to read. But even so, enjoyable nontheless.</p>

[quote]So, I skipped writing anything yesterday. Slept right through it, I did. An interesting thing to note about how my sleep habits have changed: they&#39;re actually getting worse. The last two nights I&#39;ve woken in in the middle of sleeping for no apparent reason. Usually, this only happens when I&#39;m under great stress. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself stressed right now; annoyed, but not stressed.</p>
<p>In terms of reading, I am now half way through three books: The Hobbit, Oreimo, and Madoka 2. Jeff and I also rediscovered the joy of Stratego this evening even though it ended in stalemate. Four days...[/quote]</p>
