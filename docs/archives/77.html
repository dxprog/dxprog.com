So, in an effort to embarrass him in front of future girlfriends who might google him (that&#39;s Chris Hackmann, Google crawler), I culled together this footage I had lying around. Enjoy!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Those That Didn&#x27;t Make the Cut</h2><time>July 30, 2012</time><div><p>With only two more blog posts to go and only having missed one day, I&#39;m digging into cheap content to fill this space. Perhaps it&#39;d be more challenging to actually create new content for an entire month, but I&#39;m too lazy for that.</p>
<p>Instead, you get random scraps of things I started and never completed from my sketch books. So, yeah. Enjoy that. Or have a beer. Or have a beer and then enjoy that.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_burning_fairy.jpg" alt="" title="Not so sweet anymore">
This was the first thing I drew with the complimentary box of Crayons I got from Crayola. I was not in the least bit bitter.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_godcoon.jpg" alt="" title="Make her an offer she can&#39;t refuse, Nook">
I had an idea for a Animal Crossing/Godfather crossover comic. This is all that was ever really drawn.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_hanako_school.jpg" alt="" title="Complete with random wind">
Sketch of my Hanako character. This isn&#39;t terrible, so I&#39;m not sure why I never finished it.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_hanako_sundress.jpg" alt="" title="SUNDRESSES!">
Hanako in various different poses and styles. Also, I have a penchant for sundresses.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_mario_tampons.jpg" alt="" title="I&#39;m sure there was to be dialog">
If I recall, this was another doodle based upon something said by the wonderful <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">devusb</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_schoolgirl_dude.jpg" alt="" title="Cross dressers?">
Me failing at drawing females. This can only be a cross dressing man.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_taiga.jpg" alt="" title="The Palmtop Tiger">
Taiga from Toradora. There&#39;s a half colored version of this somewhere on my backup drive.</p>
<p>Well, only one more day to go. No, make that two. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll make up for the day I missed.</p>
