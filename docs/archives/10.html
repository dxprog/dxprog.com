Not sure if it&#39;s some middle age crisis thing or what, but it&#39;s been an interesting journey.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the things I&#39;ve given a shot to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making beer and wine</li>
<li>Automating stuff in my apartment</li>
<li>Testing out various small electronics projects (so much soldering...)</li>
<li>Lots of research into arcade machine repair (lots of YouTube videos on the subject)</li>
<li>Attempting actual repair of old NES machines (lemme know if you need your cartridge connector refurb&#39;d. I can do that all day!)</li>
<li>CNC milling</li>
</ul>
<p>The electronics binge particularly has been a hell of a lot of fun. I&#39;ve yet to actually fully complete a project, but I&#39;ve prototype&#39;d an LED matrix, a camera shutter timer, and a rhythm game controller. I&#39;ve done quite a bit of research into circuit board etching and think I&#39;ve settled on a good solution that relies on fewer caustic chemicals. I just need to design up a board to test all that out with. Combine all that with the CNC machine and I&#39;m hoping to bring some spit and polish to those projects I mentioned.</p>
<p>In future posts, I&#39;ll probably elaborate more on some of these builds and what I&#39;ve learned from them. In the mean time, my mad scientist desk probably needs some decluttering...</p>

</div></article><article><h2>チャレンジ</h2><time>November 2, 2016</time><div><p>I doubt that title&#39;s even gonna render correctly...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not beat around the bush, here: this blog has been a fucking ghost town for quite some time now. Last year was quiet, but the only thing I&#39;ve written at <em>all</em> this year is an out-of-nowhere post about a frog watering contraption. Kind of sad, really. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t have anything to write about, necessarily, but can&#39;t quite figure out the &quot;correct&quot; way to write it. One thing leads to another, and that generally lead to nothing in the end.</p>
<p>That brings us to here. At the suggestion of my <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2016/11/blog-throwdown-2016/">dearest mother</a>, we&#39;ll be doing one of those post-a-day challenges for the month of November. She&#39;s started off by writing about how she&#39;s slowly becoming an evening alcoholic (I kid, I kid), but I&#39;m not sure where to begin.</p>
<p>2016 has been a rather strange year, for sure. It might actually be one of my busiest on record, but it doesn&#39;t really feel like I&#39;ve accomplished anything. Here&#39;s a bulleted list of things that may or may not become posts later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spent a couple weekends in snowy Tahoe with friends</li>
<li>Threw not one, but <em>two</em> little parties at my apartment</li>
<li>Quit LinkedIn</li>
<li>Visited Japan</li>
<li>Started working at Twitch</li>
<li>Quit working at Twitch</li>
<li>Meandered around in unemployment for a while</li>
<li>Started working at LinkedIn again</li>
<li>Made a road trip to Seattle, visiting friends and family along the way</li>
<li>Housed a friend and colleague from work for a week</li>
<li>Various other ancillary things</li>
</ul>
<p>The work nonsense is certainly the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; of this blog escapade, so I&#39;ll probably start on that tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this is a post with words that hasn&#39;t really said anything in particular. Good thing this is a quantity and not quality challenge!</p>
