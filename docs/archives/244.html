<p>Okay, so I cheated a little on this one. However, in my defense, I&#39;m winding up a 6 day run at work with no break in between so what free time I have had I&#39;ve spent doing other stuff. I promise that Friday&#39;s will be a good one (it&#39;s the one with the &quot;complex&quot; artwork I mentioned earlier).</p>

<p>I am actually a fairly large fan of Peanuts (at least, pre-80s Peanuts). However, one thing that drove me insane was that Charlie Brown never stood up for himself. He allowed his life to be a constant joke to everybody and everything around him. He should&#39;ve taken Plankton&#39;s advice and asserted himself as he does here.</p>
<p>Interesting side note, there&#39;s currently a manager at Wal-Mart whose name is Charlie Brown (seriously, what were those parents thinking :-P).</p>
