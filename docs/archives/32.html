<p>One of the things that seems to come up with some frequency at work is the size of my bed. I don&#39;t know how or why, but there it is.</p>
<p>Anyways, I sleep in a twin bed and one of my coworkers can&#39;t quite comprehend how I can sleep in a bed so small. My general response is it takes up less space and I&#39;m the only one sleeping in it (also, it&#39;s <em>fucking comfortable</em>). I also have a reverse claustrophobia when it comes to beds: the larger they are, the more uncomfortable I am. But, today as I was lying comfortable in said bed, I realized that there is a more objective way to prove my twin bed is more awesome than all other beds: it&#39;s widescreen.</p>
<p>We all know that widescreen is the preferred video format of choice these days as it closer matches the aspect ratio of our own vision; we can see a wider field of view than we can in height. Here&#39;s some aspect ratios of common video formats:</p>
<p>Anamorphic widescreen (film) - 2.39:1
HDTV, aka 16:9 - 1.78:1
SDTV, aka 4:3 - 1.33:1</p>
<p>These are width to height ratios, so let&#39;s take that and apply them to standard bed sizes:</p>
<p>Twin - 1.92:1
Full - 1.38:1
Queen - 1.33:1</p>
<p>As you can see, twin falls right in between film and HDTV, which is a particularly awesome place to be. However, the larger beds are all standard definition (with queen size being right on the money). We all know how much standard definition sucks.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ll be on my modern day standards sized bed.</p>

Seeing as I plan on rolling out the <em>new</em> site within the next few days, I thought it&#39;d be more timely to post those instead.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_layout.jpg" alt="" title="Basic layout">
An overview of the basic site layout. As you can see, there&#39;s not much difference between this sketch and the final product. Somewhere along the line the &quot;about me&quot; box was lost, but the rest is nigh spot on.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_gallery.jpg" alt="" title="Gallery">
This doesn&#39;t have any accompanying notes, but I assume that it must be a concept for the gallery pages (they&#39;re the only ones with the square grid).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_article.jpg" alt="" title="Article">
A more detailed version of a blog entry. The social media icons were eventually dropped and the comments counter moved to the bottom. Couldn&#39;t rip <em>everything</em> off of Joystiq...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_header.jpg" alt="" title="JELLYFISH SHIRT!">
I fought for the longest time with what the site header should be. I&#39;m wondering why I dropped the caricature of myself sporting my signature jellyfish t-shirt.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_theme.jpg" alt="" title="Underwater is my thing">
An idea for a full site theme. Post launch I added the circles to try and curb the gratuitous white space.</p>
<p>Arguably, my designs don&#39;t go through a whole lot of iteration on paper; they spend most of their time being refined in my head and again in code. This is not the best way to approach design, but designer is a title I&#39;m trying to leave behind, so I suppose it&#39;s okay.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag1.jpg" alt="" title="Randomness">
These are the contents of two grab bags I picked up. Nothing terribly interesting, I suppose. And the j-rap CD is just as bad as the cover might lead one to think.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag2.jpg" alt="" title="Katanashi is having a bad day">
This show is pretty hilarious and not very popular (that I know of), so I was surprised to see this at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag3.jpg" alt="" title="Hmm..">
And this is the purchase that has me seriously questioning my life. As I was unfurling it, I began to realize that I had just doomed myself to a life of perpetual virginity. Either that or I&#39;m going to have to find a very forgiving girlfriend.</p>
<p>Very, very forgiving.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>And now for some rest</h2><time>July 24, 2012</time><div><p>Continuing (and ending) my crazy weekend blitz, my dad and two oldest brothers went on a trek to Six Flags in Dallas. I and a band of coworkers had ventured out in May and I enjoyed myself enough to vow to go again (soon). A few days later while I was Skyping family, my dad was waxing nostalgic about his times at Six Flags. I decided that was reason enough to gather everybody up for a grande trip.</p>
<p>While there, I took about 438 photos (mostly quick sequential images), but here&#39;s the best of the bunch:</p>
<p>Our first stop of the day was the &quot;Conquistador&quot;. Not terribly fun, in my opinion, but okay.

<p>I forget the name of the second ride we went on, but it was snake themed. It was both the first and last roller coaster we rode.

<p>Right across the way was a teacup ride. It was highly similar to a Kiddie Park ride that we used to go on all the time wherein the thing spins around but your individual pod is also spun around... by you... as fast as you please... It&#39;s a kid&#39;s ride, but we got on for nostalgia reasons.

<p>The next ride of the day was the Superman, which takes you 245 feet into the air and drops you.

<p>The second rollar coaster of the day (which was also ridden twice) was the Texas Giant. Sadly, there are no photos of us on it, but it&#39;s a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_texas_giant2.jpg" alt="" title="This is the part where everybody screams"></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_texas_giant3.jpg" alt="" title="There are many banking turns"></p>
<p>Also ridden twice was my personal favorite coaster, the Titan. This is a beast of a ride that does it&#39;s best to crush you to a pulp using nothing but the power of momentum. This was also ridden twice.

<p>I believe there was a lame log ride in between, but the next stop was the Batman, by far the most twisty yet also the most comfortable ride in the park.

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_batman2.jpg" alt="" title="You honestly don&#39;t even feel it"></p>
<p>Of course, you can&#39;t stand around in the Texas heat without getting on a serious water ride.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_presplash.jpg" alt="" title="Wait for it..."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_splash.jpg" alt="" title="And now you&#39;re soaked"></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_soaked.jpg" alt="" title="You don&#39;t come out dry"></p>
<p>Despite being one of the last things we went on, we were dry by the time we left. And when we got to the hotel we were staying at, this was the view outside our door:

<p>The yelling that Chris and I did at each other about directions notwithstanding, it was a pretty awesome day.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&#39;s a picture of a bunch of Hello Kitty&#39;s because my dad told me too.</p>
