<p>As of the beginning of this month I began my foray into the wondrous world that is motion graphics. Our first project was to make a ten second bumper advertising ourselves or a &quot;company&quot; that represented ourselves. I was originally going to use my name and try to brand myself as myself, but it was advised by an instructor that I brand myself under a pseudonym, at least for the remainder of school, so as to have something that gives a lasting impression. I decided to play off of my more or less established internet moniker, dxprog, and came up with dx productions. Grab yourself some popcorn and prepare to be sold my awesomeness.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/internet-rule-48-is-defined-herein">Internet Rule #48 is Defined Herein</a></h1><time class="post__published">February 12, 2008</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>If you&#39;ve been around the internet as much as I have you&#39;ll probably know that it has it&#39;s own set of rules. Of these rules, #34 is most famous. Rule #34 states:</p>
<p><strong>If it exists, there is porn of it.</strong></p>
<p>Unwanted results from an innocent Google image search is enough to say that this rule is nearly one hundred percent true. However, there is no definition for something that&#39;s even more true than rule #34 (luckily, it&#39;s also more safe for work). I hereby decree that Internet Rule #48 will be defined as:</p>
<p><strong>If it exists, there is anime of it.</strong></p>
<p>This rule can be nearly solely confirmed by one website: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a>. For anybody who has never really scoured the annals of dA, it should be noted that almost 90% of everything posted is anime or some lame attempt at anime. A good chunk of this is fan art of just about anything. It doesn&#39;t matter what TV show, movie, comic, game, or person it is or is from. If they exist, somebody has drawn it in anime form. Let&#39;s get to proving using five examples from each stated category.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. Anything under the sun has anime art made of it, and nearly all of it can be found on deviantArt. So, let the internet propogate with the wisdom that is Internet Rule #48.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/video-games-live-something-for-everybody">Video Games Live - Something for Everybody</a></h1><time class="post__published">January 31, 2008</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/bumpers/VGL.png" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>I had the great fortune of being able to attend a <a href="http://www.videogameslive.com/">Video Games Live</a> (VGL) concert. For the uninitiated, VGL is a concert where game music is played. Some people may think it&#39;s nerdy, however, but I see it as something that can be appreciated by gamers and non-gamers alike.</p>
<p>People see the words &quot;video game music&quot; and probably automatically think of the bleeps and bloops (more accurately, triangle and square waves) of the Atari and NES days of yore. These may not have sounded great, but because of the limitations more effort was placed on making themes easily recognizable and pronounced (i.e. Mario, Zelda, Metroid). However, since the days of the SNES, video game music has been approached more like a movie score. At the forefront of this movement was Nobuo Uematsu and his work in the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy serves as an excellent demonstration of the similarities between game and movie music. Final Fantasy VI, and SNES game mind you, has one of the best scores of any game. Each character has their own theme, or leitmotif, and these themes are woven throughout every piece of music in the game. The same went for FFX, though the motifs weren&#39;t character specific, but specific to certain cultural elements. Star Wars takes this kind of approach: the Empire has a theme, the Force has a theme, etc. It&#39;s this kind of music that has the ability to evoke emotions in the listener and, at its core, that&#39;s what music is all about.</p>
<p>Of course, not all game scores are orchestral. Koji Kondo dabbles in a little bit of everything, and there are rock and techno type stuff out there. I lean towards the orchestral myself because I find it to be more powerful. I will admit that most of my childhood was spent listening the classical music and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams">John Williams</a> and as such I have a soft spot for this kind of music, but I know die hard fans of vastly different genres who appreciate the vocals of Halo or the trumpet heavy Zelda. Even my mom, a dedicated 80s gal, enjoys much of my game music library.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. The conception that game music is various beeps and just for nerds is a complete fallacy. Video game music these days can be just as powerful, if not more so, than latest blockbuster. At that, it can be appreciated by all walks of life. And I think it should be.</p>
<p>Oh, the concert was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9npt7JaVmLI">awesome</a> (I scream before the rest of the crowd at about 0:31).</p>
<p>(Like the bumper at the top? I&#39;m going to start including these in more of my posts as a design challenge for myself.)</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/wherein-the-author-imparts-upon-his-audience-the-ongoings-of-his-life">Wherein the Author Imparts Upon His Audience the Ongoings of His Life</a></h1><time class="post__published">January 22, 2008</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It&#39;s been some time since I have updated this blog. So I take leave of my busy life, if only for a moment, to fill you, the reader, in on the various happenings and goings on. (Okay, that&#39;s enough eighteen hundreds talk).</p>
<p>So, Christmas has come and gone (as it always does) and I am now back into the thick of school. Luckily, I don&#39;t have all sucky courses this month. No, I only have one. However, let&#39;s put the good news before the bad, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>ADG</strong>
Advanced Computer Graphics, or ADG, is probably the second best course I&#39;ve had thus far (<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/into-the-christmas-swing-amongst-other-things/">NOS</a> being number one). ADG is, more or less, a Photoshop/Illustrator class. DCG was also this to a slight degree, but more emphasis was placed on the actual design as opposed to technical issues. Now, however, we&#39;re in the thick of opacity masks, and layer styles, and blah, blah, blah. Actually, believe it or not, I&#39;ve become more comfortable in Illustrator than I am in Photoshop. The pen tool, simply put, is the most brilliant thing since aged cheese. But don&#39;t take my word for it, take my art:</p>
<p>[gallery=NES]<img src="http://img00.deviantart.net/244b/i/2008/021/2/e/nes_vector_illustration_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="An NES created using nothing but vector shapes"><img src="http://img09.deviantart.net/07b2/i/2008/021/3/1/nes_advertisment_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="Using the image from before and placing it into an ad.">[/gallery]</p>
<p>It should be duly noted that the NES is not, in fact, a photograph. Nor was it some fancy job I did in Photoshop. No, it was done completely in Illustrator and, vector graphics being what they are, is infinitely scalable. The advertisement, however, is not. Oh, and speaking of which, I realize that the NES is pushing twenty-three.</p>
<p>My other course is geometry and I will leave you simply with this: proofs can burn in Hell.</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;d like to say real quick: iPod Touch is the best PDA ever created. I know. I own one. Damn you Apple, damn you.</p>
<p>My site is still riding on a wave of hits from the Rock Band drums thing way back when, but I&#39;ve had another surge in popularity thanks to <a href="http://andrewrudson.com/main.php">this guy</a>. He&#39;s created one nicely polished drum kit app and has kindly linked back to my page. It&#39;d be wrong for me not to return the favor.</p>
<p>Finally, while I&#39;m throwing out links, be sure to check out the newly revamped <a href="http://www.game-boyz.net/">Game Boyz</a>. While you&#39;re at it, why don&#39;t you sign up on the forums and tell my bro how awesome the comic is.</p>
<p>Well, that should appease the masses for the well being. I write these posts in hope that somebody is reading them, however, even if it just serves as a chronicle of my life for me to read later, then so be it. It&#39;s deep tomes of history have already provided me with hours of cringing agony. May it continue to do so in this grand a glorious new year.</p>
