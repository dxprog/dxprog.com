My thoughts: This guy is way too nerdy. That doesn&#39;t look too good on his part considering that I am a self-professed geek. But he didn&#39;t stop there, he also addressed the school board dressed in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJKkjcPLBzE">Jedi robes</a>. But, just because a guy is nerdy doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect upon his ability to perform the duties and obligations that come part and parcel with the position he is trying to fill. Oh, but wait... he&#39;s got a strike against him in that department as well:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m <em>extremely</em> happy with how good I did :-)&quot;</p>
<p>This was posted by Christopher Knight as a postmortem to the embedded video above. Anybody who wants to work in any kind of school environment should at least be able to use proper grammar (for those who didn&#39;t get it that should be &quot;how well [he] did&quot;). And that smiley face just isn&#39;t doing it for me.</p>

Even though I&#39;ll only be able to bowl twice I&#39;m still excited. I&#39;ve been bowling twice in the last couple of weeks and did really well, all games over average and two over two hundred. I could even have some beers if I wanted. T&#39;will be an awesome time to be sure.</p>
<p>Today <em>also</em> marks the two week mark until I leave for Florida. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m currently bored out of my skull. I got most of my packing done <em>last</em> week so that&#39;s done. I really don&#39;t have much to pack, really. What packing is left to do is of the stuff I use regularly... wait. I <em>have</em> said this before :-/. Granted, I haven&#39;t packed the kitchen stuffs yet so there is something left to do. I also need to get my haircut at some point.</p>
<p>That isn&#39;t to say I&#39;ve been completely idle. I did do that little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html">YPN</a> thingy. I&#39;ve been playing some games that I never finished <em>ahem</em> Thousand Year Door <em>ahem</em>. I <em>was</em> going to make another short movie, but lack of wardrobe kind of puts a damper on that. You&#39;d think it&#39;d be a simple matter finding a white wig, but no. Not in Bartlesville.</p>
<p>Whilst I was out on one of these wig finding missions I ran across something at a local craft store. It was a cheap glue gun (packaged and distributed in my good state of Oklahoma). It looks fairly standard to the casual observer but reading the fine print reveals, well see for yourself:</p>

<p>Needless to say I&#39;m sending it in to Jay and hopefully it&#39;ll make headlines some night. If it does I&#39;ll be sure to have a YouTube clip up here the next day.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/have-you-ever-hated-yourself">Have you ever hated yourself?</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 1, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Sounds like the title of one of the many things I see copied and pasted onto a MySpace bulletin. Before anybody cries foul, I don&#39;t hate myself. I&#39;m a very content person and more or less happy with who I am. And beside, I&#39;m going to a kick ass school (one month from yesterday) so life is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>However, the last few days I took a trip to the past and came face to face with my younger, stupider, teenage self. What started out as a kind of fun little programming project quickly brought home that, yes, I was a complete douche bag. It was just a small project to keep me occupied (which it did), but...</p>
<p>I restored the old <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html">YPN message board</a>. It was kind of fun to read some of the old stuff from before I came on, but the minute I started getting to my posts the pain came on. It was obvious that I was... different. I was trying to fit in a crowd of very different people but I thought I was cool like them. If I saw something that pissed me off (and it didn&#39;t have to be much) I&#39;d make some idiot remark instead of just shutting up and moving on. When I came to power it was obvious it went straight to my head. Most of that is more apparent in the days after the old phpBB forum (which I have not gone through), but it all begins right there.</p>
<p>For your enjoyment I have provided a list of all the groan moments:
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/visual-basic.html">Visual Basic</a> - In which I become kage-chan&#39;s bitch/lackey
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/comp-specs.html">Comp Specs</a> - Reopening a locked thread, and check out my triple post at the bottom. That eraser trick was pretty sweet, though. Too bad mechanical mice are non-existant anymore.
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/php-viewer.html">PHP Viewer</a> - No comment
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/siblings.html">Siblings</a> - I&#39;m still not good in ethical debates which is why I avoid them like the plague.
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/workaround-for-when-ass-is-in-nonvulgar-words-like-bottomembly.html">Workaround for when &quot;ass&quot; is in nonvulgar words (like bottomembly)</a> - devusb - I told you this happened before me :-P.</p>
<p>I look back on these posts and think to myself &quot;surely that wasn&#39;t me,&quot; but I&#39;m the only person on the internet with the dxprog moniker. It had to be.</p>

<p>Today I stepped on a nail. It felt good so I stepped on it again. God, my life sucks.</p>

Especially when I know I&#39;m just going to ramble about random stuff.</p>
<p>Today marks the three week mark until move out day. Excited? Yes. Packed? Partially. I started packing last week and have pretty much gotten to the point where&#39;s there&#39;s nothing left to pack save what I&#39;m currently using (Xbox, computer, TV, that stuff). I suppose I could pack up my pots and pans and malarky, but eh...</p>
<p>I did wind up trading Pokemon (and a myriad of other games) in and picked up a copy of Puzzle League. It&#39;s good, but it definitely is NOT Tetris Attack. Ranked matches... well there really aren&#39;t ranked matches. The closest thing is the &quot;Birthday Mode&quot; which ranks you against people with the same birthday. I&#39;m number one... and the only person on the list. Not many people play PPL online. Another thing that cheeses me off is the difficulty level; it&#39;s too easy. There&#39;s really slow, slow and about what would equate to normal in TA. Nothing in between. The music sucks too. It&#39;s just standard ambient/techno type music like you&#39;d find in Lumines or any recent (non-DS) Tetris game. The music from Tetris Attack was awesome. Every single piece. I&#39;ve got the Blargg music on my iPod for heaven&#39;s sake! That&#39;s how awesome it is. But otherwise, it is Tetris Attack and I can play online but they&#39;ve screwed up the best puzzle game of all time.</p>
<p>I took a little Lord of the Rings quiz thingy on Facebook (which is definitely better than MySpace) and I&#39;m a true LOTR fan. The questions were rediculously easy like &quot;What race is Legolas?&quot; Some information I suppose probably can&#39;t be gleaned from the movies. But at that even a casual reader of the books could get all the questions right. Either that or I&#39;m a bigger nerd that I thought. Meh.</p>
<p>Well, like a said, general ramblings of random stuff.</p>
