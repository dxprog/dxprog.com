Of course, it took them this long to get me my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/3843402434/sizes/l/">diploma</a>. Now, I am usually a fairly patient person, but there is one exception to that rule: mail order. Waiting for this diploma was like ordering something from Amazon and then having to wait two years for it to get here. But, it&#39;s here now and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>Well, it would be if I had a job. I&#39;ve applied to three places now, those being <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/">ConocoPhillips</a>, <a href="http://www.griffincommunications.net/properties/businesses">Griffin New Media</a> (both web dev jobs), and a contract motion graphics job out in Florida with <a href="http://www.feldentertainment.com/">Feld Entertainment</a>. Phillips I didn&#39;t hear back from for a month and a half and at that the only contact I had was a short note saying I&#39;d been passed up. I got calls from both Griffin and Feld (on the same day even), but Feld never called back after their initial call.</p>
<p>Griffin, on the other hand, has taken an interest in me and I&#39;ve had two interviews there now (both of which went pretty well, in my opinion). The people I&#39;ve interviewed with have been extremely nice and seem to have my interests in mind as well as theirs. My first interview seemed mostly to quiz me on my web development knowledge in addition to establishing what the position I&#39;d applied for entailed. The second was more formal in terms of the questions asked and the environment in which it was conducted. Also in that interview, I had to take a skills test in which was given an hour to design and code a small contest entry page. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to finish everything on the list, though my design was good and my HTML validated first crack out of the barrel. So, at this point I&#39;m waiting to hear back from them. I&#39;m really hoping for this job because it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve been working towards the last several years and the environment and people working there are really nice.</p>
<p>Outside of job hunting, there hasn&#39;t been too much more going on in my life. So, instead of wasting precious bytes telling you how awesome the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0eNHP9rBcg">Taiko no Tasujin</a> series of games is, I&#39;ll wrap it up here.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Welcome to Esoteria</h2><time>July 22, 2009</time><div><p>I find myself at the end of my college life, living back in good ol&#39; Oklahoma and completely bored out of my skull. Of course, there is on the near horizon the promise of employment, which should take up the next forty years of my natural life. I should relish these moments as I will not have a moment like this in some time... especially if a wife and kids are part of my ultimate master plan. But, I suppose itemization is in order.</p>
<p>Nearly a month ago, I completed my college education and graduated from Full Sail University with a bachelor of science in Digital Arts and Design. The ceremony was all very pomp with much circumstance. During my particular ceremony, there were some two hundred people graduating (all of the bachelor kids, not just my class). I marched along the line of my old instructors shaking their hands (and getting hugs from one). It felt kind of ethereal and even now I&#39;ll stop suddenly and realize... it&#39;s over. Everything that had sucked up my very being for the last twenty-one months is finished.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s all done and now I&#39;m back home with my family. Not a bad place to be, I suppose. The plan was to take a hiatus after the near non-stop barrage of school. It&#39;s been nice, no doubt about that, but now I feel restless. I want to do something and I don&#39;t have anything that needs to be done. So, that would suggest to me that it&#39;s time to return to the working forces, a new and more educated man.</p>
<p>Actually, a couple weeks back I applied at ConocoPhillips (the family workplace) for an opening they had for an ASP.NET developer. I&#39;ve yet to hear anything, but my application is supposedly under &quot;secondary review&quot; same as it has been since the offer closed on the seventeenth. The waiting is killing me and never have I been so eager to receive a phone call. I suppose if this falls through (as it&#39;s kind of looking like, but I&#39;ll give it a bit more time) there&#39;s another place in town that I&#39;m going to apply at. It&#39;s a design group that I more than qualify for (HTML/PHP type stuffs), so maybe I&#39;ll have some more luck there.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to find a job soon. I suppose if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll have more time to update this blog. Hooray for you.</p>
