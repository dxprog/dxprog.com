Not only that but they would pull pillows and blankets off the shelves to lay on... and then we gave them free soda and cookies! But anyways, I was also able to see the supply before just about anybody else in the store (working so near the security cage ihas it&#39;s nice points ;-)).</p>
<p>Ah, but anyways. I did get my paycheck on Thursday. Because it only counted towards a week and a half it was $190 as opposed to the post-$200 figures I was figuring. But now I&#39;m going to be working close to 35-39 hours a week so that number should be close to doubling by next payday.</p>
<p>I also got my extra 10% Christmas discount with that paycheck. Stinky thing is it had to be used before December 4th. So I went ahead and stuffed my laptop on layaway. It has to be out by the 15th (though I may be able to get that changed) but I think that since I&#39;m working the longer hours I will be able to pay the thing off and maybe even have a little extra left.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I should wrap this up. I hope everybody out there has a good Thanksgiving! :-D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Another reason to hate cats</h2><time>November 16, 2005</time><div><p>Now it may be a fairly unkown fact about me, but I can&#39;t stand cats. Mainly, if for any reason, it is because at our old house there were cats that made a permanent residence there. And when the males went around marking their territory, it wasn&#39;t pretty.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I have another reason to hate cats: It seems I&#39;m allergic to them. Yesterday I went to an allergist to see what the heck I&#39;m allergic to because I have nasty allergies at certain times of the year (and I&#39;ve got asthma so we were there for that too). Well, I went in and they poked my back with all sorts of pollens and stuff. It appears I&#39;m not allergic to anything organic (as in trees and such), just cats and dust mites (apparently I got a huge welt from the dust mite test). They also put me through a treadmill test to test my lung function and I got another surprise there. I&#39;m not asthmatic enough to even be labelled with having activity enduced asthma. So I&#39;m testing that by laying off my inhaler whilst being active and seeing what gives. I made it through bowling last night without a problem. Tomorrow when I go to work I won&#39;t &quot;deasthmaize&quot; and see how I do there.</p>
<p>Speaking of tomorrow it&#39;s my first payday (yay!). It&#39;s driving me insane to see how much I&#39;ve made in the last two weeks. I&#39;ll probably have a picture of me and my check stub up for you people :-)</p>
<p>In the land of NES development I&#39;ve gotten two opcodes interpreted but now I&#39;m stuck on something else: it seems I&#39;m not interpreting the ROM data right. I&#39;ve run my test ROM through a couple of disassemblers and they&#39;re reading the first four bytes in as something else (actually, the two disassemblers had different results. Go figure :-P). I&#39;ll have to do more research to figure this out. In the mean time you can read a blow-by-blow run-down of development <a href="http://www.youngprogrammers.net/index.php/CoolNES">here</a>.</p>
