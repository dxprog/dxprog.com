Back in August of 1992, Nintendo released unto the world the little gem known as Mario Paint. Bundled with it&#39;s own mouse Mario Paint was the equivalent of Adobe Creative Suite for the Super Nintendo. You could draw pictures, do animations, and it even came with a nifty little mouse based game called Gnat Attack. However, Mario Paint&#39;s legacy lies not in it&#39;s visual abilities (though it inspired a certain <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">internet cartoon</a>). No, Mario Paint is all about its music creating abilities and the amount of high quality Mario Paint remixes on YouTube is absolutely astounding. Narrowing it down to three videos was a challenge not only because of the sheer volume of videos out there, but there are two guys who have the lions share and I wanted to give everybody a chance. Oh, and Mario Paint Composer doesn&#39;t count. But, enough rambling, enjoy![break]</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Welcome to Game Music Fridays!</h2><time>May 23, 2008</time><div><p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/gmf.png" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Some time ago, video game news site <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/">Joystiq</a> began a weekly <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/tag/musicday/">series of posts</a> highlighting video game music as performed by the YouTube community. For some reason unbeknownst to me they no longer do this. So in the spirit of all things game and music related, I bring you Game Music Friday. Every week I will select a theme or game and show three videos from YouTube pertaining to said topic. The only stipulation being that the music must be performed or arranged by the community. That means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_music_video">AMVs</a> are out. If you have any suggestions for videos or a topic, please leave a comment below and I&#39;ll be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I bring to you the first Game Music Friday, the topic of choice being Dr. Mario. Enjoy![break]</p>
