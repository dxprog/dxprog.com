<p>So, yes, here is the new design. It&#39;s not the same one I was working on <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/redesign-the-reason/">back in October</a>. No, it&#39;s better. I was actually going to use this for my final project in Fabian&#39;s class (NOS), but he borked his server and essentially axed the entire set up a blog requirement. I do owe him a lot for this design as it was his, shall we say, technique that inspired me. Design aside, this is the easiest transition to new design/engine I&#39;ve ever had (thanks in no small part to the fact that I reused the current database structure).</p>
<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to blog right now. I&#39;m going to be returning to good old Bartlesville for Christmas in a few days. Perhaps I&#39;ll write something then. In case I don&#39;t say it in time, I hope everybody has a Kick Ass Christmas!</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, I added tagging. Maybe I&#39;ll add a tag cloud later.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Site upgrades: Now with more caching</h2><time>December 3, 2007</time><div><p>I have culled some scripting from my WIP site to add database caching support to the current scripts. I&#39;ve been noticing lately that the database has been having trouble keeping up with the higher demand so that is why I rushed this out the door. Overall things are much faster, however, information is only pulled from the database once an hour so there&#39;s going to be a delay between, say, somebody adding a comment and it actually showing up on the page. This bug will not plague the next iteration which is set to roll out within the next two weeks.</p>
