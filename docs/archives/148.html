Now this is a crummy recreation of what&#39;s in the paper, but until I can get all the pictures scanned and stuff this&#39;ll have to do.</p>
<p>But enough of the nicey, nice stuff. Tomorrow they&#39;re coming again to finish the painting but this time <em>I&#39;m</em> here. Bwa ha ha ha! I AM MATTBERT, EVIL DIRECTOR OF QUALITY CONTROL! BWA HA HA!! It&#39;s not quite done yet, but I&#39;ve even rigged up a Dilbert style self-portrait of myself (which I will have online once the UDM is finished).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the UDM is coming along quite nicely. I got a ton of work done today and everything is looky pretty spanky! You can take a <a href="http://tetra.dyndns.org/docs">looksee</a> if you want.</p>
<p>Well, I need to get some sleep so I have plenty of energy for whip cracking... I mean.. painting tomorrow ;-). G&#39;night!</p>

I was out helping mom with little kids but I plan on staying next Saturday to be the Supervisor from Hell(R) :-D. Some sanding and spackle jobs done by the teens who are pulling this off was... well, not professional. And while I don&#39;t expect them to be perfect, painting over screws and nails is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Saw an <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,120341,pg,1,00.asp">interesting article</a> about how people ranked their ISP. SBC was pretty up there and, to my joy, AOL was dead last. Guess I&#39;m not the only one who thinks of it as <strong>AO</strong>-he<strong>L</strong>.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often">Days like this don&#x27;t come too often...</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 21, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Indeed, they don&#39;t. To start my day off I was awakened with the news that my copy of Zelda: The Minish Cap came. And on top of that I also got my first trial issue of Nintendo Power. Of course, this was all dampened by the news that American School sent me Geometry. Fun....</p>
<p>Okay, so that was all cool in and of itself (except the geometry). I then carried out my normal routine of checking <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com">ACC</a>, <a href="http://www.youngprogrammers.net/">YPN</a>, and <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>. After that, being at a loss of what else to do, I decided to see if a verdict had been reached on the <a href="http://contest.createdbyx.com">game contest</a> I entered. I was expecting the &quot;Judging is now taking place&quot; message which has greeted me so many times in the last three weeks. But instead, there on the front page were screenshots of my game and in glorious, itilicized large font &quot;Winner: TAttack&quot;. Now, you tell me that if that were to happen to you you wouldn&#39;t be a little eccstatic ;-). So I will now be awaiting my free copy of VB.NET standard (which, ironically, is the same promotional thing I got rid of just a couple months ago :-P). I plan on finding some sort of cheap .NET book at Gardener&#39;s this Saturday and selling the whole kit and kaboodle on eBay (just like last time). I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;ll do with the money yet, but for the moment I&#39;ll think I stash it into savings for safe keeping until I pick up my copy of Zelda: Twilight Princess in Novemeber. Chances are, though, that I&#39;ll have a job by then and it won&#39;t be an issue.</p>
<p>This day was a long time in coming, and it&#39;ll be a long time till something like that happens again. But I&#39;ll be waiting ;-).</p>

<p>For a while there, back during my more public weeb years, I would round up some brothers and we&#39;d review anime at the end of a year. Having gone through old posts recent (as I do), I kind of missed that. It not only got my own thoughts out of my head, but gave me some insight into the thoughts of my bros. It was pretty neat.</p>
<p>That was five years ago...</p>
<p>Since then, I&#39;ve really toned down anime fanboyism beyond some collecting (which stays in my office) and watching a handful of shows per year. If you only see two or three shows in a year, that doesn&#39;t make for much of a pool with which to write a wrap up. If you do that for several years, however, then you&#39;ve got something to write about. Also, you learn that your little sisters are now suddenly self-labeled otaku and the idea of doing that little writing exercise sounds like fun again.</p>
<p>That leads to the end of this intro and the beginning of Five Years of Backlog Anime Reviews, All in the Family Edition! I myself will be picking only shows from 2014-2018, but considering everybody has been playing catch up, no such restrictions there. Also, given the number of participants this time &#39;round, only one category per day.</p>
<p>Best OP</p>
<p>The Five Methods of Obtaining Happiness That I&#39;m Aware Of - Gourmet Girl Graffiti</p>
<p>I had a hell of a time with this. First, I couldn&#39;t remember any OPs from the last five years off the top of my head, even as I scrolled down the list of shows I viewed. Then, of the three I actually remembered, I couldn&#39;t whittle it down to one. One Punch Man&#39;s &quot;THE HERO!!&quot; has musical hooks coming out the ass, but the opening animation wasn&#39;t quite as great as I remembered. A similar story for Death Parade&#39;s &quot;Flyers&quot;; an awesome toe tapper of a song with some interesting visual sequences. In the end, though, I have to give it to &quot;The Five Methods of Obtaining Happiness That I&#39;m Aware Of&quot; from the bizarre food show, Gourmet Girl Graffiti. Not only have I listened to the shit out of that song (some 200+ times), but the actual animation is a charming little narrative all its own. It follows the protagonists through an Alice in Wonderland themed food adventure, accentuating the song which has notes (pun intended) of curiosity and adventure. Unlike my runner ups, it actually doesn&#39;t resort to lazy panning shots or stils, either, ultimately gaving it the edge to win.</p>
<p>Best ED</p>
<p>Chiisana Boukensha - Konosuba</p>
<p>Unlike my search for an OP, there are plenty of EDs in the 2014-2018 time range that are awesome. I prefer EDs in general because they tend to be more diverse in their sound... or maybe they&#39;re usually just slower and I like slow songs. Just like the song I&#39;ve chosen as my favorite! I&#39;ve described Konosuba as the anime version of Always Sunny. It&#39;s zany, it&#39;s irreverent, and it&#39;s damned hilarious. So, it&#39;s a pretty cool change of pace that the closing song is a slow folksy affair set over tilt shift photography of the town in which the characters live. It&#39;s cathartic just seeing the world be normal in an old timey kind of way after twenty minutes of craziness.</p>
<p>Best Character</p>
<p>Kazuma, Aqua, Megimun, Darkness - Konosuba</p>
<p>So, there&#39;s definitely some cheating going on here, because I&#39;ve selected four characters as my single best. But, hear me out.
Worst Character</p>

The biggest is, yet again, Tetra. I&#39;m also starting some GBA dev and trying to get ACPD3 finished.</p>
<p>In other news, I finally seem to have gotten accustomed to the grips in my bowling ball. The other night I shot my current all time high of 172... very sweet :-D. I also shot an all time high series of 501.. also very sweet ;-). I&#39;m hoping to take advantage of some of that beautiful free bowling tonight or tomorrow. Dad&#39;s got the rest of the week off so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too hard to swing ;-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gotten myself hooked on Final Fantasy III/VI again. <a href="http://www.consoleclassix.com">Console Classix</a> is a very, very cool thing :-) (though, I&#39;m kind of mooching off my younger brother&#39;s subscription ;-)). I&#39;d forgotten how great that game is. I&#39;m considering getting the FF anthology that was released for the Playstation, but I&#39;m not sure yet. One thing I am sure of is that this weekend I&#39;ll be reserving my copy of Twilight Princess... it looks oh so cool!</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve bored y&#39;all to tears, but hey, now you get ae more personal insight into the person known as... dxprog!</p>
