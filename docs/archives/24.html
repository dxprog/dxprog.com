<p>Instead of packing my shit for the move to &quot;Cali&quot;, I&#39;ve been doing not much and also watching TV and movies. I may have stated earlier, but the Breakfast Club is almost wholly responsible for the creation of <a href="http://whatshouldmattwatch.com">whatshouldmattwatch.com</a>, and I finally just bought a copy and watched it. I feel that I will not be able to adequately review this movie because there is simply so much going on. To that point, I don&#39;t think a single watching is sufficient to really pick up on everything this movie has to offer. So, what I will do is offer my brief synopsis (as useful or not as it may be) and then muse about my thoughts on each character (hence the title of this post). Critical review really is not my forte and I don&#39;t want to try and pretend that I can.</p>
<p>Early one Saturday morning, five students find themselves stuck in detention for the remainder of the day. Seemingly, each person is of a different high school character archetype: the athlete, the criminal, the basket case, the brain, and the princess. Throughout the course of the day, each person gives up (willingly or not) details about their lives and all is not necessarily as it seems with the fronts they put up.[break]</p>
<p>Before I go on a character break down escapade, I want to say that this is one hell of a movie. As stated above, there is simply so much happening that it&#39;s really hard to wrap your mind around all of it once. With the exception of a couple of random &quot;action&quot; scenes that, in my opinion weren&#39;t really necessary, this movie exists almost entirely as dialogue. It&#39;s a cerebral and psychological movie and certainly not as lighthearted as other Hughes films like Sixteen Candles or Ferris Bueller. Shit gets real in this movie.</p>
<p><strong>Allison (The Basket Case)</strong>
Allison, by nature of her shy and quiet demeanor, is probably the least complex character of the group. Or she might be the most complex. It&#39;s hard to tell because she admits to being a habitual liar, so we can&#39;t really know whether anything she&#39;s said in the movie (even the part about being a liar) is true or not. At one point she states that her parents ignore her, which would certainly give credence to developing such a trait in an attempt to get their attention. It would also lend to her eccentricities such as eating a Captain Crunch sandwich and her goth-ish appearance. I can&#39;t help but feel that every shy/quiet character ever created after 1985 is in some way modeled after her.</p>
<p><strong>Claire (The Princess)</strong>
Claire is supposed to be the super popular, rich bitch of the group, but she never really acts it. Probably because she&#39;s caught in the middle of a marital spat between her parents and really doesn&#39;t want to have anything to do with either. Once again, we have Molly Ringwold in a role that sees her lamenting her lack of <em>sexual action</em>, though it&#39;s again implied that this resolves itself at the end of the movie. I&#39;m about to go off on a tangent.</p>
<p>This whole virginity as a negative stigma thing is quite possibly the most fucking retarded preconception of the human race. What does it matter if you&#39;ve done the nasty? Does this somehow make you a better or more of a person than other people? When talking about adults, having had your V card punched is the <em>norm</em>. Is that it? Is it one of those &quot;everybody&#39;s doing it and you&#39;re not therefore you&#39;re weird&quot; things? I&#39;ll tell you that I consider myself pretty successful as a person in my personal, work, and social life without ever having <em>verbed the adjective noun</em>. I suppose people think that one&#39;s virginal state is a direct reflection upon their aptitude as a social being, but here&#39;s something mind blowing: it can be a <em>choice</em> just as much as it can be an <em>inability</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew (The Athlete)</strong>
Andrew lives on the whims and decisions of his father whom he hates. He does this in an attempt to prove that he&#39;s not worthless. Despite being &quot;the jock&quot; of group, you can tell early on that beneath the facade that he probably actually cares about the well being of the others in the group as he&#39;s always the first to lend assistance in their troubles. Of course, he could just be white knighting, but I it could be an attempt at atonement for the actions that landed him in detention.</p>
<p><strong>Brian (The Brain)</strong>
Brian&#39;s early bits in the movie are cringe worthy. He pipes up in other people&#39;s conversations with his own quips without measuring the atmosphere just to feel involved. I sadly identify with this all too well, especially in my youth. Also, his name isn&#39;t fair; it&#39;s an anagram of &quot;brain&quot;.</p>
<p>[b]John [Bender] (The Criminal)[/b]
God, I don&#39;t even know where to start with this one. John is by far the most complex and quite possibly the smartest and definitely the most biased of the group given his abusive upbringing. He&#39;s also the most entertaining with his lack of shits given attitude taken with everybody else. In a lot of respects, he reminded of Shawn Hunter from Boy Meets World.</p>
<p>So, there is my horribly inadequate attempt at organizing my thoughts into words on this movie. I will end by saying that I was not entirely happy with the ending. I&#39;m not a fan of open endings, not at all Sam-I-Am. Maybe in Hollywood&#39;s never ending quest for sequels, we&#39;ll get one for this.</p>
<p>No. Please don&#39;t.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/retroreview-aladdin">RetroReview - Aladdin</a></h2><time>April 2, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JwgroQG.jpg" alt="" title="Aladdin"></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why, but for the last several months I&#39;ve had this odd hankering to watch the old 1992 Disney animated classic, Aladdin. Sometimes while driving home from work in my car I&#39;ll burst out into a song from the flick. I even braved the children&#39;s section of the library once in an attempt to snag a copy. (This is a thing I will never do again unless I am accompanied by a child; it felt awkward). So, knowing that my folks had a copy and that I&#39;d be joining them for Easter, I put out the proposal that we watch after our ham riddled feasting. This would be my first time watching through the eyes of and adult and the first time I&#39;d seen it in at least fifteen years.</p>
<p>The plot isn&#39;t really something I should have to <em>synopsize</em>, but I&#39;ll do so anyway. Set ten thousand years in the future in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah, there is a magical lamp in which resides a genie who can grant (almost) any three wishes to the person who rubs said lamp. Antagonist Jafar is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it for he wants to rule the world. Aladdin is a poor, thieving, and horny teenager who, as it turns out, is the only guy who can retrieve the lamp from its resting place in the Cave of Wonders. Along the way, he runs into a runaway Princess Jasmine who is also horny and tired of her life. Long story short, Aladdin gets the lamp and hijinks ensue.</p>
<p>Thematically, the movie seems to be about being unsatisfied with life. All of our characters yearn for something more from life but are &quot;trapped&quot; in their situations. Aladdin&#39;s poor and I guess doesn&#39;t want to get a job. Jasmine is sick of having her father and the law dictate her life. Similarly, Jafar is also bound by the Sultan&#39;s rule and just wants to watch the world burn. And, finally, the Genie would rather not be at the beck and call of whomever rubs his tiny dwelling.</p>
<p>Let the musing begin.[break]</p>
<h2 id="making-an-effort">Making an Effort</h2>
<p>In writing a sentence in my second synopsis paragraph, I thought of something I hadn&#39;t before. Why _is_ Aladdin a street rat? He&#39;s poor, yes, and has to resort to thievery just to survive. But we don&#39;t see him actually <em>making an effort</em> to improve his condition. Instead of handing out CVs to the local sugar dates or fish stalls, he just bitches and moans about how life is unfair. Fucking put some effort into it, boy. In real life, the solution isn&#39;t just handed to you as a magical lamp or a random encounter with royalty. You have to actively _do_ something to change your life. Jafar, while certainly being evil, has obviously done quite a lot of work in his quest to rule the world. Not only is he an accomplished sorcerer, but obviously also a fairly learned man if he&#39;s able to pull all the pieces together in his search for the lamp. Jasmine also makes her escape from the palace in an attempt to change things. Her process may have been ill thought out and naive, but a step is a step. The only person who actually cannot do anything about his condition is the Genie and he is, for the most part, the happiest character in the entire flick.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Aladdin is deadbeat scumbag.</p>
<h2 id="speed-dating">Speed Dating</h2>
<p>The movie also suffers from the usual Fairy Tale Relationship Syndrome in that Aladdin and Jasmine hit it off with very, very little time of actually knowing each other. A chance encounter in the marketplace and a magic carpet ride is all it takes for these two to commit to a life together. Shit like that just doesn&#39;t happen in real life and, if it does, it&#39;s <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/9/">exceedingly rare</a> when it works out at all. Perhaps that&#39;s why I have a penchant for stupid romcom anime; it&#39;s slightly more real in that it takes a dozen episodes (on average covering six months to a year of story) before guy and girl get to the relationship stage. Granted, there&#39;s usually a lot of contrived shit in between, but time-wise, it&#39;s better. But, I digress.</p>
<h2 id="an-excellent-judge-of-character">An Excellent Judge of Character</h2>
<p>To be honest, Aladdin and Jasmine, while technically being the main characters, are ultimately the most forgettable. They&#39;re bland and cliche and, while there is certainly nothing wrong with the acting, they just don&#39;t stand out. The real stars of the show are Jafar, Iago, and of course, the Genie. Even the carpet has more personality, though that&#39;s not surprising since it takes more thought to get a feeling across using nothing but pantomime.</p>
<p><strong>Jafar/Iago</strong></p>
<p>As a kid, I never would have felt anything for Jafar. Disney movies are made so that everything is black and white; Aladdin&#39;s the good guy, Jafar the bad. Done deal. And while that still holds more or less true, there were moments where I felt sorry for Jafar. He&#39;s got a job working for chubby dullard and his air head daughter. Now that I&#39;ve been in the workforce for a few years, I can understand exactly how he feels. Granted, we don&#39;t ever get an insight into whether there&#39;s a <em>reason</em> he&#39;s evil instead of just apathetically sarcastic, but work for that kind of person long enough and one might just turn evil. Or...</p>
<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that Jafar isn&#39;t the evil one after all. Iago is painted to be the comic relief of their tag team duo, but he&#39;s obviously just as aware of what&#39;s going on if not more so. His sarcastic remark to Jafar&#39;s statement of Gazeem being &quot;less than worthy&quot; and Jafar&#39;s lack of reaction to the tone means that Iago is in a relationship of equals with Jafar (or close). It was Iago and not Jafar that came up with the plan to marry Jasmine, become the Sultan, and then off her and her father. I think the only thing keeping Iago from being a runaway evil success is that, in the end, he&#39;s just a parrot.</p>
<p><strong>The Genie</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s honestly not much to say about this. Robin Williams _is_ the Genie, although he doesn&#39;t have quite as much screen time as I remember. It&#39;s also interesting to think that he&#39;s really the only A list actor in this movie and that it was a big deal at the time. The tables are exactly the opposite now; it&#39;s a big deal and almost heresy when a movie has an unknown in a leading role (Ratatouille is a good example). Getting back to the topic, the amount of pop culture references that Robin Williams&#39; characters pulled out is infinitely more hilarious when you&#39;ve lived a few more years. For the first time ever I got the burping the Tupperware reference.</p>
<p><strong>The Carpet</strong></p>
<p>This is less a blurb about the carpet and more about the technology used in the film. CGI was still in its infancy at this point and Aladdin was only the second animated Disney film to use rendered to film computer visuals (Beauty and the Beast being the first). It is painfully obvious, too. The Cave of Wonders is very CG looking, the lava in the lava chase is very CG looking (the recolored fractal texture just seems off). The tower rolling down the snow covered mountain at the end doesn&#39;t fare any better. And the reason why I put this under the carpet is because, while the carpet was hand drawn, the texture was applied digitally and it makes for some rather odd looking effects. One of the big things in cartoon style animation is the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_and_stretch">squash and stretch</a> to make animation look more... animated. Well, this leads to some very ugly results on the carpet texture because, while when the carpet is at rest things look fine, when it is morphed into an exaggerated shape, the texture becomes exaggerated in places that it might not in real life. Somehow Disney managed to find a spot in the Uncanny Valley for an animated rug. Granted, it still looked better than it did in the Aladdin TV series (where they just hand animated it). I could never figure out why it looked so shitty as a kid, but now I know.</p>
<h2 id="ugh-musicals">Ugh... Musicals</h2>
<p>It was typical for the time, but every goddamned animated film was riddled with musical numbers. Why? I don&#39;t know, but Aladdin is no different. Everybody winds up singing about their strifes or whatever at some point. Again, I don&#39;t know why; singing will not solve most of life&#39;s problems. Most of the songs are benign, but the main one, &quot;A Whole New World&quot; is so. Fucking. Catchy. And I don&#39;t mean catchy in the annoying kind of why. It&#39;s a damn good song. Remember that bit above about how I sing in the car? This is usually what I break out into. There&#39;s just something about it...</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ve said more than I need to about this film, so I&#39;m going to wrap it here. If I do another one of these, Beauty and the Beast will probably be next as it stands with Aladdin as probably one of the most watched films of my life (as a child).</p>

Not only is this a lie, but it&#39;s also a farce. Granted, it could have been closer to truth if I had clicked the submit button on of the previous two times I sat down to pen this block of text. But, I don&#39;t like to dwell on the past. It&#39;s set in stone and cannot be changed. All I can do is look forward and make that as awesome as I can.</p>
<p>If somehow the only way you get your &quot;me&quot; information is via this blog, then you&#39;ve missed out on the big announcement of my hiring at LinkedIn and upcoming move to Mountain View California. This puts my life in an odd state of flux right now as I prepare to move myself and my things seventeen hundred miles west. Needless to say, the items on my list are going to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Not only have I had McDonald&#39;s once since the previous post, but Taco Bell twice. The first cannot be explained away, the second can. Cool Ranch Doritos tacos. Also, I&#39;ve been trying to spend as much time with the folks around me as I can. Generally, going out to eat is a good way to do that. Of course, when my lunch hour is eaten up (pun intended) by eating out, my usual noon wanderings don&#39;t happen. Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t do it later, I guess... But, I&#39;m honestly not worrying about exercise right now as I&#39;ll be getting plenty of that biking to and from work in CA.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Ha! Yeah, nothing about moving to California is going to be cheap. Moving my shit is going to be $1000+, the apartment is going to be $2300/mo, and this doesn&#39;t take into account any ancillery costs that will come with. Luckily, LinkedIn will be paying to relocate me, but I will have to shoulder all of costs initially. To say I&#39;m a bit nervous about whether I will be able to afford everything up front and continue to live between my last Griffin check and my first LI one is a bit of an understatement. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll all work out in the end, but that worry is there.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Ha.... yeah...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post some more about the whole LinkedIn thing at some point, but there may be a quiet spell until things get settled.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong> - A little bit of good, a little bit of bad. The weather has been on and off favorable for walking and, when it was, I&#39;ve made the best of it. Today and Saturday both I did 7+ miles worth of walking and I&#39;ve finally brought my weight below the impentitrible 219 barrier (216 at the lowest). That&#39;s a trend I certainly want to continue. I must confess, though, that I did have McDonald&#39;s once a week-ish ago. I should also state that I plan on having Taco Bell this weekend when my brother comes for a brief visit from college. Gotta try that new Dorito taco, after all. But, other than that, I have no plans to get on the recurring fast food wagon.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - More money than should have been was spent, though none on Japanese things (amazing considering that <a href="http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/P4YrzRQ2Qub2OldV=E/browse/item/97476/4/0/0">Nisemono</a> has been calling my name). I purchased a new 2TB hard drive for my computer as I was certain my existing one was dying (considering the speed and stability increase I&#39;ve had since the swap, am still certain of). I&#39;ll call that necessary. Add to that the fee for my passport, a higher than usual restaurant visitation rate, this <a href="http://www.teefury.com/archive/2056/Legend_of_Jedi/">bitchin&#39; T-shirt</a>, and certain other expenses, I spent more than I would have liked. Though, I did dabble in some freelance work which offsets at least some of all that. Actually, a goodly amount.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Nothing. I&#39;ve done nothing. And I am ashamed. How will I ask all the Japanese girls for their phone numbers? Oh, wait. That&#39;s the one thing I _do_ know how to say.　でんわばんごうですか？Honestly, though. I&#39;ve been keeping tabs on my brother&#39;s advancement in his real college course and I&#39;ve absorbed more than I&#39;d thought. I just really need to bolster my vocabulary.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/movie-review-american-graffiti">Movie Review - American Graffiti</a></h2><time>February 26, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3ZAfLYl.jpg" alt="" title="American Graffiti"></p>
<p>Before Star Wars and after THX 1138, George Lucas made a little film called <em>American Graffiti</em>. Despite studios acting like assholes, as the often do, the film was a financial success, making fifteen times more than its budget on first theatrical run, and was welcomed to critical acclaim.</p>
<p><em>Graffiti</em> is a coming of age type story set in the early 60s, following four groups of mostly high school seniors, as they burn through one last night of <em>teenagery</em> before going their separate ways to begin the next chapters of their lives. Steve (Ron Howard) is planning to go off to college and tries to get his girlfriend to go along with the idea of an open relationship. Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) is having second thoughts about college, and has various hi-jinks and adventures as he tracks down a woman in a white Thunderbird who randomly mouthed &quot;I love you&quot; to him at a stop light. Street racer Milner (Paul Le Mat) is just out cruising in his &quot;piss yellow&quot; hot rod when he finds himself in the company of young a teen aged Carol (Mackenzie Phillips). Finally, &quot;The Toad&quot;, who is borrowing Steve&#39;s car, picks up a random girl and spends the evening cruising with her and getting into various troubles. Somewhere in there, Harrison Ford shows up and acts like a dick.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be blunt: I didn&#39;t enjoy this movie. For the longest time as I was watching, I kept asking myself &quot;where does the plot come in?&quot; Almost immediately, we&#39;re introduced to a shit ton of characters who then go their separate ways. Every few minutes, the plot narrative will bounce between one of the four groups making it hard to gain a mental foothold of what&#39;s going on for the first half hour or so. I probably wouldn&#39;t have had this issue had I realized going in that there is no central plot and this is, more or less, a slice of life piece. The stories of each group interweave every once and again and all come together at the end, but there&#39;s no singular plot thread holding the pieces together.</p>
<p>Our characters are the usual fare I would expect for a baby boomers era group of teenagers; namely, they&#39;re all a bunch of ass wagons with nice looking cars. Steve treats his girlfriend like shit, making demands of her after breaking the news that, while he&#39;s away, they should see other people to &quot;strengthen their relationship&quot;. Curt gets a raging boner from a passing stranger in a vehicle and this is the catalyst for his entire arc. Perhaps I&#39;m an oddball, but when random people yell things of this ilk at me from cars (or otherwise make similar statements to me), I generally raise an eyebrow, shrug, and continue on with life (this has happened before and on multiple occasions). &quot;Toad&quot; plays the stereotypical &quot;geek + car + girl&quot; role, nigh identical to &quot;Farmer Ted&quot; in <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/movie-review-sixteen-candles/">Sixteen Candles</a>. Interestingly, the most likable character in the movie is the motor head, Milner. Yes, he doesn&#39;t treat Carol the greatest, but he makes the decision not to be an ephebophile and sticks with that the entire movie.</p>
<p>The one facet of this movie I did find interesting was the soundtrack. From beginning to end, it plays as if we&#39;re listening to a radio station complete with DJ cut ins and advertisements. Both the content and the station itself play some affect the story and sometimes ties scenes from different groups together chronologically. I thought it was a pretty nifty touch and definitely helped set the tone and feel of the film. Not that it had any problem with that before.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m not a fan of <em>American Graffiti</em>, though I can see why others might like it. I actually felt while watching that it felt a lot like <em>Animal House</em>, which, incidentally, I didn&#39;t really enjoy either. Luckily, George Lucas made a couple of other films that are entertaining to watch.</p>
