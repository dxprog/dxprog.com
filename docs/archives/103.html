<p>One day, somewhere between Christmas and New Years, a coworker of mine was musing out loud about a vanity reddit account he had created. He was describing exactly what it would do and I was like &quot;dude. We can automate that.&quot; So, in a fury of coding and some poring over reddit documentation, I pulled together a very simple bot that did exactly what he had described. Slapped it on an every ten minutes cron job and called it a day. The code was ugly and I vowed to make a nicer version.</p>
<p>That I did and, while I was at it, decided that I should make it a simple framework with which I could bots in a simple manner and have a central script that managed them all. The above source is what I settled on (complete with a working, if not banned, version of a binky79 clone).</p>
<p>My own bot idea, as it was Christmas, was for a bot named Ebeneezer<em>McUpvote (a portmanteau of Ebenezer Scrooge, Scrooge McDuck and everyone&#39;s favorite reddit term, upvote) to randomly upvote a new link and add the comment &quot;Merry Christmas! Have an upvote ^ </em> Q&quot;. Scripted, running, would execute every five minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Ebeneezer_McUpvote">People hate it.</a></p>
<p>As of this writing, that bot has -310 comment karma. Now here&#39;s where the fickleness of reddit shows through.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as I was browsing, I came upon <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ogjx1/its_439pm_saturday_in_australia_i_am_drunkthis_is/">this post</a>. So, Oprah giving random upvotes is considered cool, eh?</p>
<p>Enter, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/OprahGivesAnUpvote">OprahGivesAnUpvote</a>. She does pretty much EXACTLY the same thing as Ebeneezer_McUpvote, only she says &quot;Look under your chair... you got an UPVOOOOOOOOTE!!&quot;. People love her. OprahGivesAnUpvote has, at this writing, 233 comment karma and she&#39;s only been running since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Why the hatred? I dunno. Maybe people don&#39;t get the joke of Ebeneezer_McUpvote. Maybe the joke just sucks. Maybe it&#39;s not Christmas anymore. Either way, Oprah is loved, McUpvote is not. I&#39;ll be interested to see if Ebeneezer&#39;s fortune turns around when we get closer to Christmas again...</p>

<p>Well, here we are again. It&#39;s always such a pleasure. Remember when I did this <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done/">last year</a>? I do. Seems like it wasn&#39;t that long ago. But, time flies, as they say, and with increasing age, it does so with increased velocity, it seems. This calls for some retrospective and forward contemplation.[break]</p>
<h2 id="the-previous-year">The Previous Year</h2>
<p>As linked above, last year I made a series of goals for myself to achieve. Let&#39;s look in and see how I fared on that:</p>
<p><strong>Draw more</strong> - Could probably count on two hands the amount of times I set pencil to paper for art&#39;s sake. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Finish all my Squeenix games</strong> - Despite a rocky start, I did finish Final Fantasy X-2 (from which I am still having nightmares). Never touched another game on that list. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Lost the spare tire</strong> - My weight held for most of the year, and during the summer months I made a pretty good effort to at least keep in some semblance of physical shape, between climbing the stairs in my office building and running the treadmills. That all died somewhere towards fall, though, and I&#39;ve put on weight since. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Apartment and girlfriend</strong> - Perhaps the only section on the list where I wasn&#39;t a complete failure. Upset with my conditions at my old job, I sought new and greener pastures and got the pay bump I needed to set out on my own (now I&#39;m back at that old job, but with more pay). On the girlfriend front, I&#39;ve made a handful of probes, but at this point I think I&#39;m content where I&#39;m at and will let things fall into place as they come. So, I&#39;m going to say <em>SUCCEEDED</em> on this one.</p>
<h2 id="the-coming-year">The Coming Year</h2>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve looked back on my list of past failures, let&#39;s set up a list of NEW ONES!</p>
<p><strong>MOAR EXERCISE</strong> - I have a good exercise facility at my disposal and I need to utilize it as much as I can. Goal - 3 hours of exercise per week increasing in amount and intensity as my physical endurance improves.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR GAMING</strong> - I didn&#39;t game much over the last year, but still was raking in games (no thanks to the Steam sale...). This year, I aim to finish all of those, but at the very least, this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skyward Sword</li>
<li>Catherine</li>
<li>Tales of Vesperia</li>
<li>Left 4 Dead (1 and 2)</li>
<li>Bioshock</li>
<li>Mass Effect (1 and 2)
If I can hit the Squeenix games, so much the better</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MOAR SOCIALIZING</strong> - I spend far too much time at home surfing reddit when I could be doing fun things with other people (male and female). My thoughts are to join some organized sport (bowling league, for example) or finally show up to a meeting of that Japanese Language group  in town. Any way you look at it, I need to do more with people.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR DRAWING</strong> - Said it before, will say it again: I can never get better unless I just do it.</p>
<p>Well, there we are. Here&#39;s looking at a productive 2012. Right up until we all die on the 21st of December.</p>
