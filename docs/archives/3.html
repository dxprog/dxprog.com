I don&#39;t regret my choice. It was a sweet movie with crazy effects and magic and some good old Marvel humor.</p>
<p>That said, it&#39;s now a bit late and I want a quick way out. So, here&#39;s a before and after photo of one of my recent broken NES aquisitions.</p>

<p>I have both of these machines, but the one on the right is the one in the after picture. The internals of the thing were fine, for the most part. The connector was shoddy as hell, though, so I refurb&#39;d the pins with a dental pick. After a little soak in the tub and a little scrubbing, it now plays games fabulously and <em>looks</em> fabulous too.</p>
<p>The one on the left has board issues of some sort, so when it does play at all, the graphics are all crazy go nuts. I wanted to grab a picture of Mario 3, but couldn&#39;t get the game to boot.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>That Time I Resolved a Copyright Complaint</h2><time>November 17, 2016</time><div><p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/that-time-i-got-to-file-a-copyright-claim/">yesterday&#39;s post</a>, I received an email from the company that produces the Ben Heck show. They were, of course, wondering what was up with the copyright claim and apologized since the production company switched between when the video was originally posted and now. The dude&#39;s name was Matt, so you know this is an an individual to be trusted.</p>
<p>Humor aside, I found working with him on the whole thing to be rather easy and pleasant. As stated above, he was apologetic, but professionally so. All he wanted was to have the video restored, all I wanted was an ask for permission and attribution. Over the course of a handful of emails, I retracted my copyright complaint, and the video reappeared on YouTube with one small change:</p>

<p>Now that this whole issue has been nicely resolved, I can finally feel that little bit of accomplishment knowing that some of my design work is being seen hundreds of thousands of people and enticing them to watch the video.</p>
<p>Really, that&#39;s pretty cool.</p>
