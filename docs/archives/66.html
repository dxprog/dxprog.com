<p>So, I&#39;m walking around the downtown area, an activity I&#39;ve undertaken in an attempt to accumulate 10,000 steps/day for a work thing.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#39;m walking around enjoying the scenery and weather when I spot a giant billboard. On it is a man and his three young children. I was slightly touched by this nice picturesque scene... until I read the accompanying text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our daddy will sell your home... GUARANTEED!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In just a few words, this man went from upstanding role model of the American family to a parental pimp, whoring out his children to make a quick buck. Does anybody else find this kind of advertising appalling? </p>
<p>I see a commercial for a local used car reseller and his prepubescent daughter is going on about how her daddy will get you the best deal in town. Is this supposed to make people go &quot;awwww&quot; and rush out to buy a car, or are they marketing to pedophiles?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Leave it to Capcom to ensure that the protagonist of their games has a super cute, teenaged female sidekick. I&#39;m down with that :)</p>
<p>Oh... I forgot Ema. Blast it all...</p>
<p>On a final note, I will not use my tablet for soft shading again in a long, long time...</p>

<p>An attempt to break away from the &quot;draw what I see&quot; and start hammering away at my skills. I&#39;ve been doing a fair amount of drawing the last week or so and subconsciously kept drawing the same character. Once I realized this, I decided that perhaps she can become my OC and drew this. Her name is Hanako, which means &quot;flower child&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m beginning to see progress in terms of anatomical accuracy, but still have many issues to work out. The hands and feet I&#39;m fairly satisfied with as well as the legs (though, there&#39;s some work to be done). The arms and shoulders, however, are what I see as the glaring issue here. Also, the shape of the lower half of the face. Things to address as I continue my grind quest to become a level 80 artist.</p>

I don&#39;t make it a secret that I have <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-video-game-reviews/">thoroughly</a> <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/452291">enjoyed</a> the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/comic---pheonix-wright:-animal-attorney/">Ace Attorney.</a> <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/stuff-and-nonsense/">series</a>. There&#39;s so much to enjoy about them; the crazy cast of characters, the edge of your seat stories and the twists they take out of seemingly nowhere. Be it Mr. Wright himself or his vest wearing successor, Apollo Justice, there&#39;s no doubt that these are incredibly addictive, quality games. However, there was one character that we as fans had always wanted to play as, but were only given the opportunity briefly; the egotistic, pompous and slightly emo Miles Edgeworth. Well, Capcom heard the cries of the fans and bestowed upon us Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney Investigations.
