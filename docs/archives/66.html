While I was doing this, I  recalled some of my first web related programming projects, most notably YPNgine. Considering it was my first major PHP outing, I pulled off quite a feat. Writing a message board is no small task. However, there was one part in particular that I was mulling over: the censor. </p>
<p>If you happen to be a former YPNer, you may recall seeing many references to &quot;bottomembly&quot;. Carrying over the censor find/replace list that had been used on phpBB before it, all instances of the character sequence &quot;ass&quot; were summarily replaced with &quot;bottom&quot;. Now I am being very choosy when I say &quot;character sequence&quot; and not &quot;word&quot; as the censor couldn&#39;t differentiate words.</p>
<p>This oversight was brought to my attention my young programmer self struggled to figure out a solution. Here&#39;s what I wound up doing:</p>

<p>As you can see, I started hard coding in a list of safe words, replacing those instances with a random (or not so random) string of characters, run the censor and then convert those strings back to the safe words. This was a list I kept expanding on as they were found during normal conversation on the forum. I giggle as I look at this list and think of what the censor was doing to those words: bottomume, glbottom and hecko.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just something that I, eight years later, have to look back on and chuckle about.</p>

It was terrible, but I found myself reading through it again one day not too long ago for whatever reason. One comic in particular intrigued me as I was attempting to <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54170/anime-tracy/">take a stab</a> at &quot;anime style&quot;, an in joke to a couple of sudden character design changes I&#39;d made. Here is the panel in question:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Kate2006.jpg" alt="" title="Kate circa 2006"></p>
<p>Now, one thing that intrigues me about this picture is that, at the time, I absolutely despised anime and all arts Japanese. That being said, I do not remember using much of anything as far as reference to even attempt to match the style. Just slap on some large, shiny eyes and a pleated skirt. DONE!</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to revisit this frame and, given that I am actually attempting to draw in this style seriously, envision it as it should have been.

<p>This is a re-imagining of a panel from a comic I drew back in the summer of &#39;06. Proof that I have made some sort of artistic skills progress.</p>

This is something I do, on average, every 6-8 months or more (I didn&#39;t really bother to calculate the actual average). Looking through my past profile pics on Facebook, I noticed something interesting: they convey a visual history of my beard. My beard is certainly deserving of its own blog post, so I will regale its tale here for the masses!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007a.jpg" alt="" title="Circa April 2007">
<strong>April 2007</strong> - A couple of straggling hairs, but otherwise nothing. My hand does not deserve to be stroking a smooth chin.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007b.jpg" alt="" title="Circa May 2007">
<strong>May 2007</strong> - At this point, there&#39;s enough hairs that I could probably have cosplayed as <a href="http://aceattorney.wikia.com/wiki/Gumshoe">Detective Gumshoe</a> quite easily.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007c.jpg" alt="" title="Circa October 2007">
<strong>October 2007</strong> - Okay, let&#39;s face it. 2007 was a crappy year for the beard.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2008.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2008">
<strong>October 2008</strong> - While certainly not filled out, the beard was finally showing some promise of being EPIC. Interesting side note - I had to Photoshop that smirk onto my face</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2009.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2009">
<strong>May 2009</strong> - Two years later, the beard is finally respectable enough that it can be stroked in deep thought and look awesome.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2010.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2010">
<strong>October 2010</strong> - After 24 years of beard growing, I think it&#39;s finally gotten to the &quot;You don&#39;t want to fuck with me&quot; status. The shades help.</p>
<p>Some other interesting things to notice in these pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>My face is almost always pointed away from the camera</li>
<li>I get fatter as time goes on</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you see (and I am NOT making this up) OCTOSHARK on SCI-FI last night.  I mean the (so called) special effects were anything but!  You with a crayon and a piece of paper drawing the title creature could have made a scarier one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m never one to turn down a challenge like that, so I give you the terror of the deep, Sharktopus!</p>
