It has been my pet project for a year now and has been the catalyst for a few leaps in coding practice for me. Firstly, it&#39;s responsible for my becoming quite adept at advanced &quot;OOP&quot;-like JavaScript-ing. Secondly, it&#39;s given me an outlet to try out new things such as dynamic graphs in PHP or using Bing&#39;s search API. Let&#39;s take a brief walk through history.[break]</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;ll mention about the Page that has been intrinsic to every version: the whole concept is based on disposable playlists. Unlike iTunes or Windows Media Player which has you going through a huge list either right clicking to add to playing or ctrl-selecting and dragging off into a permanent playlist, the Music Page queues up songs in a single click, which I believe makes it a whole lot faster and easier to set up whatever music I want to listen to.</p>
<p><strong>The First Version</strong>
<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1.jpg"><img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1.jpg" alt="" title="Music Page v1"></a>
The first version of this project was really just a front end for playing MP3s through my server and didn&#39;t actually involve any streaming at all. It was more of a &quot;see if a can&quot; type thing without any real plans for fleshing out a full app. That didn&#39;t come until I decided to throw in a the Flash app.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t remember exactly why I decided to create the streaming player; perhaps so I could listen to my music while I was working at school. In fact, I believe I started this project in the month I had my PHP class. While everyone else was struggling trying to create the simple home page that was required, I was off doing extra-curricular activities. An ass I am.</p>
<p>The page pretty much stayed like this for quite some time. Somewhere, I moved everything to two columns and added playlist support, but that was it. No fancy effects, no JavaScripty goodness. Hell, it didn&#39;t even get a look refresh until November when I made a Christmas theme.
<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1_winter.jpg"><img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1_winter.jpg" alt="" title="Music Page v1 - Winter Theme"></a></p>
<p><strong>Music Page v2</strong>
<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_2.jpg"><img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_2.jpg" alt="" title="Music Page v2"></a>
The second revision of the page saw quite a lot of additional features. The first big change was completely dropping PHP for any kind of front end job. Instead, it handled data management and everything else was handled by JavaScript through Ajax. This was the real beginning of my JavaScript coding days. I&#39;d been piddling around with jQuery for a little bit before, but now I brought it out in force.</p>
<p>The second major update was the layout. Instead of having a giant list of everything off to the right like you see in most desktop media players, I hid all the track names and moved the album list to left. This, coupled with the addition of album art thumbnails and the larger font for album names, made it far easier to find the songs I was looking for. Additionally, I also included the ability to save playlists.</p>
<p>Finally, another welcome feature, was the inline upload form (not shown). Using a bunch of Ajax calls and a little C++ application to grab ID3 tags, I was able to quickly upload a whole bunch of songs without having to go to a different page or worry about page refresh due to form submission. This made the addition of music a thousand times easier. However, a page refresh was still required to update the album list on the left.</p>
<p>But, as had happened with the first one, I began shoe-horning features on that the original code base and design had never been intended for. So, I began work on the be all and end all of the Music Page.</p>
<p><strong>Music Page Rev. 3</strong>
<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3.jpg"><img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3.jpg" alt="" title="Music Page Rev. 3"></a>
With the current iteration, I&#39;ve rewritten the entire code base from ground up (except the PHP stuff. It&#39;s stayed mostly the same). This is more of a evolutionary revision as opposed to the revolutionary of v2.</p>
<p>Again, this version has seen PHP kicked even more to the curb by revoking its right to sort all the data before sending it to the page script. All of the tracks are loaded and sorted on the fly in JavaScript, which allows me to fully update the album list whenever I wish, such as after the addition of new MP3s.</p>
<p>In visual changes, I moved all the playlist data off to the right and added pages for each of the various functions. This makes the left column much less cluttered while giving the other functions the time of day they deserve. Also, by creating the paged portal, I leave plenty of room for me to expand in the future. This has already come in handy as I&#39;ve been adding features the last couple days that weren&#39;t originally intended.</p>
<p>First is the play history graph, as seen in the picture above. Before, I&#39;d been using a <a href="http://twitter.com/dxmusic">twitter account</a> to track my play history (and, somewhat successfully, last.fm before that). However, I&#39;m now storing play history in a local table in the database for the sole purpose of tracking stats (another page I could add in the future). The second feature is the addition of inline album art search.</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3_art.jpg"><img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3_art.jpg" alt="" title="Music Page Rev. 3 - Album Art Search"></a>
Using the Bing API (because Google&#39;s doesn&#39;t do image search), you can scour the webs to locate, download and set album art. The text box shown above is filled with the name of the album by default, but you&#39;re able to enter in custom terms and search to your heart&#39;s content until you find what you want.</p>
<p>So there&#39;s a history of what the Music Page has gone through. It&#39;s been quite an adventure pulling this thing together and I&#39;ve certainly learned a lot from the experience. The one thing that I think makes this project sweeter than just a fun past time is the fact that it&#39;s a viable application. I literally have not used any desktop music player since I created this thing (my brothers too). Being that I actually use it on a day-to-day basis gives me an advantage in seeing what&#39;s working, what&#39;s not and what I would like to added. I wish all projects could work out this well.</p>

Of course, it took them this long to get me my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/3843402434/sizes/l/">diploma</a>. Now, I am usually a fairly patient person, but there is one exception to that rule: mail order. Waiting for this diploma was like ordering something from Amazon and then having to wait two years for it to get here. But, it&#39;s here now and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>Well, it would be if I had a job. I&#39;ve applied to three places now, those being <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/">ConocoPhillips</a>, <a href="http://www.griffincommunications.net/properties/businesses">Griffin New Media</a> (both web dev jobs), and a contract motion graphics job out in Florida with <a href="http://www.feldentertainment.com/">Feld Entertainment</a>. Phillips I didn&#39;t hear back from for a month and a half and at that the only contact I had was a short note saying I&#39;d been passed up. I got calls from both Griffin and Feld (on the same day even), but Feld never called back after their initial call.</p>
<p>Griffin, on the other hand, has taken an interest in me and I&#39;ve had two interviews there now (both of which went pretty well, in my opinion). The people I&#39;ve interviewed with have been extremely nice and seem to have my interests in mind as well as theirs. My first interview seemed mostly to quiz me on my web development knowledge in addition to establishing what the position I&#39;d applied for entailed. The second was more formal in terms of the questions asked and the environment in which it was conducted. Also in that interview, I had to take a skills test in which was given an hour to design and code a small contest entry page. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to finish everything on the list, though my design was good and my HTML validated first crack out of the barrel. So, at this point I&#39;m waiting to hear back from them. I&#39;m really hoping for this job because it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve been working towards the last several years and the environment and people working there are really nice.</p>
<p>Outside of job hunting, there hasn&#39;t been too much more going on in my life. So, instead of wasting precious bytes telling you how awesome the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0eNHP9rBcg">Taiko no Tasujin</a> series of games is, I&#39;ll wrap it up here.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/welcome-to-esoteria">Welcome to Esoteria</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 22, 2009</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I find myself at the end of my college life, living back in good ol&#39; Oklahoma and completely bored out of my skull. Of course, there is on the near horizon the promise of employment, which should take up the next forty years of my natural life. I should relish these moments as I will not have a moment like this in some time... especially if a wife and kids are part of my ultimate master plan. But, I suppose itemization is in order.</p>
<p>Nearly a month ago, I completed my college education and graduated from Full Sail University with a bachelor of science in Digital Arts and Design. The ceremony was all very pomp with much circumstance. During my particular ceremony, there were some two hundred people graduating (all of the bachelor kids, not just my class). I marched along the line of my old instructors shaking their hands (and getting hugs from one). It felt kind of ethereal and even now I&#39;ll stop suddenly and realize... it&#39;s over. Everything that had sucked up my very being for the last twenty-one months is finished.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s all done and now I&#39;m back home with my family. Not a bad place to be, I suppose. The plan was to take a hiatus after the near non-stop barrage of school. It&#39;s been nice, no doubt about that, but now I feel restless. I want to do something and I don&#39;t have anything that needs to be done. So, that would suggest to me that it&#39;s time to return to the working forces, a new and more educated man.</p>
<p>Actually, a couple weeks back I applied at ConocoPhillips (the family workplace) for an opening they had for an ASP.NET developer. I&#39;ve yet to hear anything, but my application is supposedly under &quot;secondary review&quot; same as it has been since the offer closed on the seventeenth. The waiting is killing me and never have I been so eager to receive a phone call. I suppose if this falls through (as it&#39;s kind of looking like, but I&#39;ll give it a bit more time) there&#39;s another place in town that I&#39;m going to apply at. It&#39;s a design group that I more than qualify for (HTML/PHP type stuffs), so maybe I&#39;ll have some more luck there.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to find a job soon. I suppose if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll have more time to update this blog. Hooray for you.</p>

I&#39;m sure I say it every time I do this, but this iteration is by far the most advanced version of the site to date. I can pretty much wrap up all the updates in a nutshell by saying I&#39;ve had a lot of fun throwing in all sorts of jQuery and Ajaxy stuff, but I&#39;ll itemize.</p>
<p>The front page, for starters, shows the latest and greatest projects and blog posts on the site in the featured pane. The gallery has undergone a huge overhaul and is much more intuitive than it was before. I&#39;ve also uploaded quite a lot of new content to the gallery page, so go take a gander at that to see what awesome stuff I&#39;ve been up to. And finally, even the contact is looking spiffier with a picture of yours truly and a link to all the social media outlets I&#39;m currently signed up for.</p>
<p>With the new design out of the way, I&#39;ll shift focus to the new {mh}labs; section of the website, where you&#39;ll be able to find all sorts of little pojects that have never been released to the general public (and some that have).</p>
<p>The future is bright at dxprog.com, so be sure to bookmark us and return often for all sorts of goody goodness.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/all-good-things">All Good Things</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 28, 2009</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It seems that ignoring the blog is the fashionable thing for me to do, as of late. It&#39;s not entirely intentional, there&#39;s just really nothing to talk about. Sometimes, while I&#39;m attempting to force myself into a state of unconsciousness, I&#39;ll think of these things I&#39;d love to post ranting about this, that, or the other. However, rarely do I actually act upon these impulses and the dust continues to gather.</p>
<p>The one thing that has happened since I last blogged is the passage of time. And with that passage I draw ever nearer to my graduation date. Currently, I sit at less than a month till I walk with my fellow classmates and receive the piece of paper for which I have worked so hard to achieve. It&#39;s hard to believe that not two years ago I was making preparations to come here the thought of actual completion not even in my head. But, here we are.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve achieved much in my short twenty-one months at Full Sail, both from an academic and personal standpoint. I&#39;ve improved my design skills, learned the technical art of motion graphics, and added to my repertoire of marketable programming skills through ActionScript. I know better how things in the industry work and have finally been able to get the professional critique that I so longed for as a hobbyist working out of his parents&#39; house.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made a lot of memories at this school, both good and bad. It&#39;ll be sad to have leave all the friends I&#39;ve made, but everyone tells me I have a bright future ahead of me. As for what I think of that, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I know I have marketable skills, but there are some things that I know will hold me back. For example, I would like to live close to my family. That alone throws out almost any motion graphics or film job that I could have. I suppose it boils down to what&#39;s more important to me: my family and friends or my career. Even at that, I don&#39;t really know what career path I&#39;d like to do. i enjoy and am proficient at many things (both inside and outside my degree).</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;ll stop there before I completely depress myself. The next few months are going to have a crucial part in shaping my future. I&#39;d better make damn sure I get it right.</p>
