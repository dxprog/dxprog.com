And I&#39;m really kicking myself for missing these because they were all high caliber titles. So, a few weeks late and out of context, I bring you the remainder of &#39;08-&#39;09 reviews.</p>

If you can excuse the rather poor writing and me tripping up over my words, you may find enjoyment in it. Either way, it&#39;s been fun writing these reviews and I look forward to the good stuff to come in 2010!

Today I focus mainly on shounen/action genres.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-ball-z">Dragon Ball Z</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_dragon_ball_z.jpg" alt="" title="Dragon Ball Z">
Without <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> the American anime market may very well not exist (certainly not the way it does today). <em>DBZ</em> is certainly an entertaining show, what with all the rediculous battles and &quot;power up&quot; sequences, but it&#39;s not without its faults. Cheesy and reptitive animation dampen the action sequences and there really isn&#39;t a whole lot of character development. In fact, I consider <em>DBZ</em> to be almost like a &quot;bro show&quot;. And, toss on the fact that no character can ever really die and a lot of the suspense has just been killed. But, at that, it does make for some excellent entertainment if you&#39;re willing to overlook the formulaic plots and the aforementioned other problems. <strong>6/10</strong>

I&#39;m thinking perhaps that an art section on the gallery page might be a good idea, but in the mean time you can enjoy it right here or on my <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt page</a>. But, I digress.
[gallery=December 2009 Art]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Midori_Kasugano.jpg" alt="" title="The colerized version of my Midori sketch from a few months back. My reference image was in black and white which left me to figure out the shading and such for this picture. That&#39;s why it looks like her hair is a lettuce leaf..."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Ryou_and_Nagisa.jpg" alt="" title="Ryou and Nagisa from the visual novel/anime CLANNAD. I suppose this could be considered bordering on yuri, in face my brother Jeff walked in as I was drawing and said &quot;That&#39;s not platonic...&quot;. It is, of course, and who should know better than the artist? Subject matter aside, I consider this a large step up in terms of coloring and shading for me, trying out some new things."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nagisa_Winter.jpg" alt="" title="Nagisa again, this time from the After Story part of CLANNAD. I have to admit that I cheated a little on this one: I didn&#39;t sketch the line art myself. I instead traced a screen grab and did all the coloring (I wanted this as a desktop wallpaper). It actually was quite the learning experience as I&#39;d not done coloring of this caliber before and I got a lot of things figured out. I hope to begin using these techniques for my own art in the near future.">[/gallery]
I hope everybody had a Merry Christmas and will have an awesome New Year!</p>
