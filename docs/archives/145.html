So, I&#39;ve been going through my stuff today (nuked a few CDs :-D) and getting ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first night of bowling and a good night of bowling it was. The first two games were sort of ehhhh, but the last game was my best yet. I&#39;ll let the image speak for itself (haven&#39;t tested this Tetra feature, so it&#39;s overdue ;-)):

Yeah, 207! My dad was only 18 ahead of me at 225 (I beat him the first game :-D). If this had been last year I would&#39;ve gotten my 100 pins over average watch. Pooh :-P. </p>
<p>Well, with the moving and all, it may be a while until I can put anything up. I&#39;ll try to squeak out a little blurb before I have to pack my computer. Cheers :-)</p>

The people who are buying our house have basically set everything in stone and so now our house and the house we&#39;re getting will all have &quot;Sold&quot; signs. So now the packing begins (our room&#39;ll be a nightmare :-P) and in probably about two weeks we&#39;ll be in our house :-D. btw, here&#39;s some info on our <a href="http://remax.realtor.com/Prop/1048630457?lnksrc=00045&amp;gate=remax">new house</a>.</p>
<p>A couple days ago I picked up my free version of <a href="http://www.linspire.com">Linspire</a> and I decided to try to move over to Linux full time for a month. I got it installed and it was certainly nice looking. I went through some trouble figuring out how to use apt packages but I started to get the hang of things. And then the trouble set in. PHP was giving me problems with MySQL, depending on what program I tried I couldn&#39;t get the sound working/synced on DVDs (or avis) and Lsongs, while nice, obviously was running on a low priority because it would cut out frequently. And things went down from there. So, I&#39;m back on a fresh install of Win2K3 and it&#39;s nice to be home.</p>
<p>Got an interesting piece of mail the other day about a college down in Florida called FullSail that specializes in film [pre/post]-production. It&#39;s quite interesting because next to game programming the realm of film is my other big area of fascination. So whether I&#39;m going to DigiPen or this place is kind of a toss up. I guess I&#39;ll worry about that when I get there. Right now I have to keep studying for ye olde GED and get a job (so I can buy my laptop ;-)).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for today. Stay tuned.</p>

So for those of you out there who pray please add in an extra word to the man upstairs that all this goes through :-).</p>
<p>Bowling league starts again in a couple weeks (13th) which I am looking forward to. Dad and I had been on a Monday league over the summer, but it was with &quot;commoners&quot; (i.e. people who come and bowl every now and again) and the atmosphere was.... common :-P. Now we&#39;ll be in a USBCC sanctioned league again with all our bowling buddies from last year :-D.</p>
<p>I will be updating in as much as I can. Stay tuned. Now back to our regularly scheduled program...</p>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all thinking because we&#39;re moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).</p>
<p>But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It&#39;s not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.</p>
<p>Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I&#39;m in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game <a href="http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test">here.</a></p>
<p>I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I&#39;m not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let&#39;s face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I&#39;m sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you&#39;re interested in helping check out the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a>.</p>

The showing last night went incredibly well, apparently. So well, in fact, that the guy is going to be getting his financing in order within the next day or so. So that means I will be <strong>movingprog!!</strong></p>
<p>In other news, Steve&#39;s Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It&#39;ll be nice to have something to play again.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)</p>
