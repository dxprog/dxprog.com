Coming down the road are a few more styles, and the ability to add sidebars. These can be any Tetra sidebar so I&#39;m going to be rigging up an RSS feed reader sometime in the near future. That combined with the <echoy effect>Universal Document Module</echoy effect> will make Tetra quite a nicely rounded little CMS :-). And for anybody who&#39;d make a rebuttal to that last statement, Tetra is mainly for personal sites or small groups (like YPN), so SHUT UP! ;-).</p>
<p>Ah, I think I shall play some games tonight. I haven&#39;t done that in heaven knows how long :-P. That ought to change pretty quick once I have Twilight Princess in my hot little hands ;-). I do have my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/TAttack.zip">TAttack</a> game. One of the reasons I made it was so that I could play that again (leagally). Well, at least my bros and people on <a href="http://www.tetrisattack.net">tetrisattack.net</a> are enjoying it.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick up the loose threads of <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ACPatDes.zip">ACPD</a> 3 and continue the &quot;war&quot; on Anicro Desapro. Of course, for all I know, ACPD is the most used pattern maker on ACC (probably not, though :-P). Oh well.</p>
<p>Well, I got kind of long winded in that :-P. &#39;Night :-)</p>

I&#39;m moving away from traditional programming in favor of .NET. If it|qs the way of the future then I&#39;d better get into gear. Besides, since the compiled code for C# and VB.NET ends up the same, it doesn&#39;t matter which one I use. They&#39;ll both be exactly the same.</p>

Before I give the answer I will give a brief history, because it was really a trick question. <em>Esentially</em> the first <em>home computer</em> was the Apple in 1976. Ther in lies the trick. The PC was born in (drum roll) 1981 by IBM. The Apple really has never been considered a PC. So there you have it.</p>
