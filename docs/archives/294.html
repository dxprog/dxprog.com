I&#39;ve been seeing a lot about Ajax, some fancy JScript/XML stuff that basically eliminates page loading, and I may take a shot at basing my new engine around this. Of course, it&#39;s just an idea at the moment.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;ve been starting a new game. It&#39;ll basically be a Windows version of the old strategy game, Empire. I&#39;ve been messing around with D3D8 the last couple days and I finally got all the rendering stuff done this morning (yay!).</p>
<p>In the land of house-stuffs, somebody else is coming to see the place tomorrow. We don&#39;t know the details because Dad couldn&#39;t catch much of the call (due to noisy little kids). Something about they&#39;ll call again, they&#39;re from California, blah blah blah. So we&#39;ll have to vacate again, but if it means we get that house we&#39;ve bid on, who cares :-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>New house?</h2><time>August 12, 2005</time><div><p>The parents have signed the papers for our new house and to get our current one slapped on the market. Today, day one of house-on-the-market-dom, an investor came by to look at the place. As I write this we have no idea what his thoughts are, but the fact that it&#39;s only been a day is promising.</p>
<p>In programming land I downloaded every pattern from ACC and am having fun fiddling with that data. First I converted it all into pattern data (a string 1024 bytes long using hex numbers for image data) and yesterday a wrote a little compression algorithm. It&#39;s similar to BMPs RLE compression and just about halved the size of the file. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll do with the stuff now. I may lump it all into a database and build a viewer around it (it would be nice if the guy who ran ACC liked it and hired me to write the ASP version).</p>
<p>Well, we&#39;re going to be eating lunch so that&#39;s all I&#39;ll write for today. Heck, maybe the next entry will be written from our new house (would be nice). Cheers :-)</p>
