It was freakin&#39; sweet! He played pretty much every song off of Straight Out of Lynwood plus most of the mainstays (Eat It, Fat, Smells Like Nirvana, etc.). For the encore he played the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjJYywFNbuw">cellphone song</a> to which everybody, myself included, started waving their cellphones. After that he wound up with an extended version of Albuquerque. It was simply awesome. I shunned my quiet exterior and clapped and whooed and sang with everybody else. But, you&#39;re probably saying &quot;Shuddup, give us teh pix!&quot; I&#39;ve only got a few because getting good pictures with the crazy lighting so I&#39;m only giving you the good ones. Sucks to be you.

Remember when every site on the internet had some sort of cross-page transition? Remember when all sites used Times New Roman for their font? Remember animated GIFs? I do. Good Lord, those days sucked!</p>

It&#39;s a somewhat bittersweet feeling. It&#39;s awesome not to have to have the nightmares of work hanging over my head, but on the flipside I won&#39;t be able to hang around with all the pals I made over the last year and a half. Not to mention the seemingly endless supply of money is non-existant now. Oh well.</p>
<p>What really sucks, though, is the fact that I&#39;ve been sick the last several days. Actually it&#39;s more allergies than anything else. I blame the rotting vegitation due to receeding <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/tags/flood/">flood waters</a>.</p>
<p>I recently finished Crackdown. It&#39;s an awesome game but the ending really, really sucks. It sucked so bad I haven&#39;t played it since. Originally I bought Crackdown for the Halo 3 beta (which I never really played much) but the main game is still pretty sweet. I probably will start working on Final Fantasy XII again or maybe Halo 2. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t even finished Halo 1. Oh, Xbox 360 extended warranty ftw! I&#39;m no longer paranoid about using it.</p>
<p>Well, I have an important nap I have to take, so later!</p>

This time, however, is because our wonderful little town has been flooded. Since the river runs between me and my place of employment I am trapped in my house. And what a better way to waste time than by drawing.</p>

<p>Mostly some experimental stuff especially with posing, hair and head shape. Of course, the thing that gets me frustrated most is body proportions and limbs. However, I&#39;m pretty happy with how these turned out.</p>

Now it&#39;s gone. Lost forever in the digital mines of hell. I&#39;ll give you the basic rundown without the commentary because I don&#39;t feel like typing it again.</p>
<p>Top 5 Games I Can&#39;t Wait For</p>
<ol>
<li>Final Fantasy VI DS (not confirmed, but you know it&#39;s coming)</li>
<li>Pheonix Wright: Trials and Tribulations</li>
<li>Eternal Sonata</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</li>
<li>Super Smash Bros Brawl</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m going to have to reserve some money because these all come out within the first couple months of school.</p>
