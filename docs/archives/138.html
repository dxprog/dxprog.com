Should your mouth perpetually have a bar of soap strapped to it? Well then you&#39;re reading the right column. Hi, I&#39;m Dr. Matt.</p>
<p>Over the last three years my team and I have come up with a simple solution to all swearing problems. It is a simple matter of appended or prepending letters or phrases onto said bad word to make it kid friendly. Let&#39;s have an example:</p>
<p> &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t sound very nice, does it? Now let&#39;s see the same phrase after applying Dr. Matt&#39;s pateneted cuss removing technology.</p>
<p> &quot;What the shell is that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Much nicer, no? The following table contains a list of beautified words that you can use any day in front of anybody (except the pope): </p>
<p>bass
mustard
witch/itch
ship
crab
freak/frickin&#39; (funk has also been suggested, but that burders too close...)</p>
<p>In certain situations a letter won&#39;t work and you will actually have to say the word, however, after much research it was found that the word &quot;Hoover&quot; can aleviate sid problem. Examples:</p>
<p>Hoover Dam
sucks like a Hoover</p>
<p>Ans there you have it. Practice these steps everyday and you&#39;ll be on the road to verbal maturity in no time. Have a great day :-)</p>

It&#x27;s the winds of change...</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 5, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>In what could be marked as a pardigm shift for me I have purchased my first &quot;real&quot; song off of iTunes, meaning it is a modern rock song. Now the song, which I will name, I&#39;ve heard plenty of times at Wal-Mart (as much as one can hear it over <em>beep</em> <em>beep</em> <em>beep</em> and all the chatter), but I suppose I have devusb to thank for it in the end. Using some iTunes VPN thingy I was digging through his music this morn and I was able to listen to the entire song and found, horror of horrors, I actually liked it. This leads me to wonder if I shouldn&#39;t broaden my musical horizons just a hair.... But anyhoo, you&#39;re probably wondering what song could cause such a cataclysmic shift in such a humble being as myself. It&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=73648639&amp;s=143441&amp;i=73648643">Dirty Little Secret</a>&quot; by the All-American Rejects.</p>
<p>In job news I am going to be blunt and to the point: the deptartment managing specialist job SUCKS! That said I am going to beg to have my cashier job back by May. I can&#39;t stand this job anymore. The hours (and lack thereof) stink, the lack of human interaction is driving me insane and a couple of other reasons I will leave unsaid (to save my job and reputation). Had I realized that this is how things were going to be I would have stopped complaining about my cashier job and been happy. We&#39;ll see how things go down, though.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for now. In about fifteen minutes I have to be at the eye doctor&#39;s for an appointment. Stay tuned for my next post where I&#39;ll do a little bit of ranting again (yay! ;-)).</p>
<p>PS - Gold stars to anybody who can name the quotes I&#39;ve been stuffing into my posts lately.</p>

<p>Yesterday I thought it would be &quot;fun&quot; to test drive the beta of Microsoft&#39;s latest and &quot;greatest&quot; OS, Windows Vista. Hah! It&#39;s slow, it&#39;s incomplete and it gives Windows a bad name (wait....). And even worse, when I went to install XP again the Vista file permissions and junk remained so nothing worked. So I had to back my crud up, reformat my hard drive and start from scratch. As of this moment I&#39;m running without SP2 which is probably suicide :-P.</p>
<p>In work related news, I moved up again. A couple days ago I helped to resolve a rather sticky customer situation and the manager&#39;s were so impressed that I&#39;ve been offered to be promoted to support manager. This would give me the option of moving back to days which would thrill me to no end. However, having nothing but gripey customers <em>and</em> employees to look forward to would be like belly flopping into the bowls of hell. So I&#39;m still thinking about it. I did get some good news in my current job. Michael Jordan (no relation to the basketball player) is getting his hours changed so I won&#39;t be alone in the back which will be nice. It&#39;ll actually be possible to get everything done.</p>
<p>Well, I need to go upstairs and get SP2 installing (stupid butthead needs to be plugged in :-P). Until next time, happy April Fools :-)</p>

<p>I am old. I know I don&#39;t look it, but I can feel it in my heart of hearts. Why, I feel all thin, sort of <em>stretched</em>, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can&#39;t be right. I need a change, or something. In almost two months I&#39;m going to be twenty and what do I have to show for it? A job, sure (more juicy on this in a sec), but as of yet no driver&#39;s license, no high school diploma and not much of a plan for the rest of my life. Well, having been kind of depressed the last few days I&#39;ve decided to do something about it. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to schedule a driving test for next week and a testing date for the GED (probably sometime in late April, early May). I am bound and determined to accomplish at least these two things before my teenage years are forever behind me.</p>
<p>Now, the juicy details. As you all know I am working in groceries labelling overstock and putting it on shelves in a position I&#39;d since been calling &quot;Overstock Manager&quot;. Well, I recieved my official designation Saturday: Grocery ICS (Inventory Control Specialist). While being a &quot;specialist&quot; is cool and all the real interesting part happened yesterday. I recieved an e-mail from one of my old layaway/cashier pals Blake congratulating me on my promotion to department manager. I laughed it off and told him he had the wrong guy, but this morning when I was doing training modules it had me listed under two job codes: ICS Team and Department Manager (dept. 92, dry grocery). It&#39;s so nice when they tell me these things :-P. In not even five months I&#39;ve gone from a lowly layaway runner to a department managing specialist. I figure if things continue at this rate I&#39;ll be CEO of the company by the time my first year anniversary rolls around ;-).</p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s no more interesting news to report and thus I will sign off and go eat some food. Peace out.</p>
