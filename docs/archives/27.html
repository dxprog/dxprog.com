<p><strong>Health</strong> - On the upside, I managed to keep my eating of fast food to a minimum; one trip to Taco Bell late one evening. However, the pizza that work brought in on Friday probably negates that. I&#39;ve also found out that no amount of granola bars will stave off hunger for very long. In the world of exercise, I did manage at least 45 minutes of walking every work day, no small feat considering the cold turn the weather has made. I need to add something more into the mix, though, be it treadmill, push ups, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - There were actually a couple days last week where I didn&#39;t spend any money at all. Score! The purchasing of some poster frames and a limited pressing of the <a href="http://iamshark.limitedrun.com/products/508090-star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace-ost-2xlp-limited">Episode I soundtrack on LP</a> were the only real unnecessary buys last week. I successfully did stave off the desire to purchase a couple of manga this weekend, so score. I&#39;m going to try and Scrooge it the rest of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did an hours worth of work two days last week. There were plenty of times I thought about picking them up later on only to take a nap instead. I have no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Yeah...</p>

<h2 id="biggest-surprise">Biggest Surprise</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_my_little_monster.jpg" alt="" title="My Little Monster">
[b]Chris - <em>My Little Monster</em>[/b]
When 2012 started, little did I know that I would close out the year by watching a shoujo title, which -- let&#39;s not beat around the bush here -- are made for girls.  But I did.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>What I found in My Little Monster was a great little romcom with some great characters and a good -- if not flip-floppy -- central romance.  While the show&#39;s shoujo roots are apparent in the art style, most everything in the show is enjoyable even by manly men.  Best of all, there was no gaggle of wooden male characters -- I&#39;m looking at you Hiiro no Kakera.</p>
<p>The only real problem I had was the somewhat disappointing ending, or rather, the lack of an ending.  Few of the plot threads were wrapped up, leading me to hope that a second season is around the corner -- and let me tell you, I would love to see that.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_pet_girl.jpg" alt="" title="The Pet Girl of Sakurasou">
[b]Matt - <em>The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</em>[/b]
In a show that has the phrase &quot;pet girl&quot; in it, one&#39;s expectations certainly can&#39;t be high. There are certainly many shows where said phrase would be quite apt (anything from the harem genre), but to blatantly state as much in the title, one can only assume the worst. Matters aren&#39;t made any better when the previews make a point out of the fact that our bumbling heroine protagonist, autist deluxe, and aforementioned &quot;pet girl&quot;, has issues performing such simple tasks as dressing herself. The only reason I even watched an episode was to see just how low they were actually going to go.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, these moments are relatively scarce and, for the most part, play themselves out by the end of the first episode. What we&#39;re left with is a story about finding one&#39;s niche, pursuing one&#39;s passions, envy and jealousy, and learning to adapt to living around people who are insanely talented. The cast of characters, while adhering to the usual tropes, are varied and interesting and the dynamics between them make for an enjoyable watch. The titular character is still the least likable of the bunch, being far too inept to be likeable (and made more annoying in that she&#39;ll wind up being the protagonist&#39;s primary love interest, no doubt). All in all, though, it&#39;s an entertaining show that certainly could have been worse and I plan to continue watching to its conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-disappointment">Biggest Disappointment</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_kokoro_connect.jpg" alt="" title="Kokoro Connect">
[b]Chris - <em>Kokoro Connect</em>[/b]
This show should have been bad ass, and in some ways it was.  Following a group of high school students as some funky jack ass screws with their lives in various ways, the premise was solid and complemented by a solid set of characters, notably Taichi and Inaba.  Unfortunately, the execution was less than stellar plot-wise.</p>
<p>The shows first arc was extremely promising, with the group swapping bodies at random and experiencing the other characters lives first hand, culminating in the aforementioned funky jack ass taking control of one character and having her jump off a bridge because he was fucking bored.  Seems great, right?  It is, until all dramatic tension is removed by making everything turn out fine and dandy.</p>
<p>This plot structure with the dramatic build up and anti-climactic end persists into the second arc, but fails to show up to the party for the third.  When the characters are randomly turning into children and they try to play it up for serious, you know that drama was left at the door, and what little remained was swept under the table in an ending so weak I was left to wonder if I had actually seen the last episode.</p>
<p>It&#39;s one thing for an OK show to have a mediocre ending -- such was the case with Another in the Winter season -- but when a show starts off great, with a good premise and solid characters, then squanders all of its potential, you end up feeling empty inside, robbed even.</p>
<p>Hopefully the OVA can salvage some of the happy feelings I felt early on.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_papakiki.jpg" alt="" title="Papakiki">
[b]Matt - <em>Listen to Me, Girls, I&#39;m am you Father</em>[/b]
<em>Listen to me girls, I am your father</em>, or Papakiki, has a promising set up; series protagonist Yuuta Segawa takes over guardianship of his three nieces after their parents are (presumably) killed in a plane accident. My immediate thought was that this would be similar to last year&#39;s Bunny Drop, an incredibly well made show that encompasses the hardships and rewards of parenthood. Hell, even my mom loves it.</p>
<p>While Papakiki does indeed attempt incorporate some of these elements, it also has all the elements of an incestuous harem show. Any kind of emotion evoked by the makeshift family trying to adjust to their new life is immediately shattered by the eldest girl&#39;s completely illogical infatuation with her uncle (of course, they pull the not-related-by-blood card here). Or the fat sack of shit pedophile guy ogling over a three-year-old. Or Hina (aforementioned toddler) sticking yet another dick shaped food in her mouth. Moments such as this far outweigh any good ones. This show should have either gone 100% ecchi fanservice (allowing me to safely avoid it), or done like Bunny Drop and focus tell a heartwarming little tale about the joys and sorrows of family life.</p>
<p>It&#39;s trying to do both and utterly fails on all fronts.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-fuck-did-i-watch-that-">Why the Fuck Did I Watch That?</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_papakiki.jpg" alt="" title="Papakiki... again">
[b]Chris - <em>Listen to Me, Girls, I&#39;m am you Father</em>[/b]
I&#39;ll be honest, I know why I started watching this show initially.</p>
<p>Cute promo art.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the premise of the young male protagonist raising his sister&#39;s children after she tragically dies in a plane crash seemed ripe with dramatic possibilities.  Seems okay, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Every week I was assaulted with an annoying female lead throwing herself all over the protagonist and then slapping him for no other reason than he was there.  Worse still, I had to endure the grating voice of the youngest character -- who, I might add, held wisdom and emotional stability far outclassing her three year old physical age -- and watch as everybody gave her suggestively shaped food items to much on.   Adding insult to injury, all of the tough emotional problems were solved unrealistically in one episode, but not without shit tons of fluff padding the whole thing out.</p>
<p>I stated on multiple occasions that I was probably going to drop this show, and now I wonder why I didn&#39;t.  Nothing ventured nothing gained, they say, but in this case I ventured and gained shit.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll stick with nothing.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_mysterious_girlfriend.jpg" alt="" title="Mysterious Girlfriend X">
[b]Matt - <em>Mysterious Girlfriend X</em>[/b]
In brief summary, Mysterious Girlfriend X is a basic high school romance with lots of saliva swapping. And I don&#39;t mean kissing, mind you. In the entirety of the show, lips never touch. No, instead spit - displayed as being a glistening, syrup like substance complete with tinkly sound effects - is physically removed from one mouth and placed in another. Somehow, thoughts and feelings are transferred with the liquid exchange. We&#39;re initially led to believe that this is something that only the female lead can do. Combined with the numerous close-ups of her UFO bag charm, I figured she&#39;s an alien or something. I guess the reveal to why she&#39;s so &quot;mysterious&quot; is what I was hanging on for. But, there was no reveal. Apparently, saliva has magical properties in the world of this show, because other people start doing it later. In the end, nothing is explained, relationships don&#39;t go anywhere, and you&#39;re just left with a nasty, creepy feeling.</p>
<p>Two more posts to go, we&#39;ll try and get them out before the end of the month.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/accountability-report-week-1-off-to-a-roaring-stop">Accountability Report - Week 1 (Off to a Roaring Stop)</a></h1><time class="post__published">January 6, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It&#39;s time for the first installment of my public shaming, an activity aimed at keeping me on the straight and narrow for my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/hindsight-is-2012/">New Year&#39;s resolutions</a>.</p>
<p>And what a shaming I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I have eaten out several times this week (once being Taco Bell) and had a drinking party last night. Granted, my brother is in town and we&#39;re celebrating New Year&#39;s a bit belatedly, so I&#39;m going to write it off this once. On the upside, I have made more food and not had McDonald&#39;s in this thirteenth year of the 21st century.[break]</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - The last of my pre-ordered items came rolling in and I bought the Mac mini that I&#39;d been planning on buying anyways (with any luck, I can make that money back on the App Store). The slate for purchasing goods is now empty with nothing on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - My books have arrived and I will begin in earnest tomorrow evening... just as soon as I figure out how to proceed...</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - This certainly doesn&#39;t need its own section, but since my brother was in town, we hashed many of the details. The date has been formalized and tickets will be purchased very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I drew but on thing from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily">/r/sketchdaily</a> and that was the one posted on the 1st. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pCMJM.jpg">It&#39;s supposed to be a snake, but it just looks like shit</a>. Need to get back into this.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s where things lie. Hopefully this coming week will be a little better in that it will be a standard week with no deviations from the normal routine. (I still love you though, Chris...)</p>

The categories are changed up slightly from last year, but remain more or less the same. But, enough intro, here&#39;s Chris and I&#39;s favorite tunes of the year.</p>
<h2 id="best-opening">Best Opening</h2>
<p>[b]Chris - <em>Crossing Field (Sword Art Online)</em>[/b]
[![youtube video](<a href="https://img.youtube.com/vi/gMDwrRNTp8M]">https://img.youtube.com/vi/gMDwrRNTp8M]</a></p>
<p>It would be inaccurate to state that I know how to explain music, or why I like certain songs more than others. Unfortunately, my cognitive capacity for this activity is far outweighed by the naturalness of describing things assaulting my other, far more supple senses.</p>
<p>But here goes.</p>
<p>This song kicks ass – I can’t explain why, but that is the way of things, and that is how they are. Also, there’s some pretty kick-flippin’ animation in the opener that probably rivaled in budget the entirety of Space Brothers.</p>
<p>OH, SNAP.[break/0.jpg)](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMDwrRNTp8M]">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMDwrRNTp8M]</a></p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DXTk9gtOHY"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/9DXTk9gtOHY/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p>I will not lie; I chose this song solely because it had the most play counts for the year (281 as of this writing). However, it is entirely deserving of this position. Both the music, which is at the same time both powerful and gentle, and the opening visuals are pretty fantastic. The visuals in particular are dripping with a design aesthetic that could only come from studio SHAFT (coincidentally, they’re also responsible for <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-best-of-anime-awards/">my best OP pick last year</a>). A combination of a shitload of text combined with bright solids give what’s left of the designer in me a raging design boner.</p>
<h2 id="best-ending">Best Ending</h2>
<p>[b]Chris - <em>Umikaze no Brave (Robotics;Notes)</em>[/b]
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TomOoTkiCTY"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/TomOoTkiCTY/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a>
<em>(note - this is the only video of this song I could find)</em></p>
<p>You know what sucks? That’s a secret, but I’ll tell you what doesn’t suck: this song.</p>
<p>Dog.</p>
<p>It starts out unassuming enough, one of those songs where it will pop up in your sub-conscious every now and then but doesn’t really stick with you. THEN you get to refrain and fuckin’ hear, “BEEEEELIEEEEEEVE,” and your life will never fucking by the same AGAIN.</p>
<p>300 plays in the span of a month do not lie and it certainly says something about this song’s incredibly addictive nature.</p>
<p>I would make a comment about the aforementioned refrain making my DICK super ROCK HARD, but that wouldn’t be gentlemanly.</p>
<p>[b]Matt - <em>Coloring (Papakiki)</em>[/b]
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov1lWsFvS80"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ov1lWsFvS80/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a>
Again, chosen by listening habits (164 plays). I suppose that this method of choosing is not entirely fair since this show was released in the winter season, but in a season that was pretty bleak on the music front, this one stood head and shoulders above everything else (and also pretty much the only good thing to come out of this show). Much like my OP pick, the animation for this is comprised of a lot of bright solids (I like that, so sue me), but the music itself is very, very different. Where Euphoric Field is a kind of orchestral rock piece, Coloring is 100% synth pop. And I enjoy synth pop sometimes. It’s all about diversity.</p>
<p>Tune in again in a few days for more reviewy goodness.</p>

<p>The year is coming to a close yet again and with it the usual <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2012-things-to-do-before-we-all-die/">self reflective post</a> for my future self to gaze upon. Also, the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/best-of-anime-awards-finale/">anime reviews</a> will kick in soon. Not that anybody cares, but it makes for an interesting read later on. But, without further ado, let&#39;s see how I did on last year&#39;s list of self improvements and what to look forward to in 2013. I hadn&#39;t counted on this seeing as we were all supposed to die a couple weeks back...[break]</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-productivity">A note on productivity</h2>
<p>Before I begin eviscerating myself for, again, not adhering to the goals I set out for myself in the previous year&#39;s worth of days, I want to note the brighter part of the year, namely that 2012 was probably the most productive programming year I&#39;ve had in a long, long time. You&#39;ve been privvy to a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/christmas-lights-extravaganza/">lot</a> of the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">personal projects</a> I&#39;ve engaged in, but I also got a lot of shit done at work (compared to the previous year where most of my time at Winnercomm was spent on projects that eventually got canned). Not only did I rewrite or re-engineer in some way nearly every page on our <a href="http://www.newson6.com/">main news sites</a>, but I also wrote our <a href="http://m.newson6.com/">new mobile sites</a> from the ground up, taking control back from a third party. 2013 is going to be difficult to live up to in terms of programming, but the almost guaranteed return of the awwnime bracket (which garnered over a quarter million votes by the time it wrapped) and work officially carving out some time for game development, it should be an interesting one.</p>
<p>Okay, enough back patting. Now for the self-deprecation!</p>
<h2 id="2012-s-goals">2012&#39;s Goals</h2>
<p><strong>MOAR EXERCISE</strong> - On the whole, I didn&#39;t do terribly in the exercise department. I&#39;ve been a bit lax lately, what with the cold weather and such, but I managed to lose ~15 pounds from my heaviest point this year, so I guess there&#39;s that. Also, 45 minutes of walking at 3.5mph doesn&#39;t affect me near the way it used to. I&#39;m going to label this one as OKAY, which is to say not a failure nor a success.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR GAMING</strong> - From the list I provided, only Skyward Sword and the Left 4 Deads were completed. I did make some headway on Catherine and never even touched the others. However, I did do a fair amount of gaming and acquired two new consoles, a 3DS XL and Wii U. I also played a lot of visual novels, but I&#39;m not sure if that really counts as &quot;gaming&quot; or not. Mostly reading, I suppose. I&#39;ll again chalk this one up as OKAY.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR SOCIALIZING</strong> - Compared to 2011, I was pretty social this year. I went on a combined total of four dates between two girls before putting my foot down on any more dates with either. I also went outside of my normal bubble of do-nothing weekends and spontaneously agreed to a trip to six flags with some friends from work (doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal, but spontaneity is not my strong suit). I also did some volunteer work in a charity program my company runs. Granted, there wasn&#39;t much socializing going on there, but I was outside the house and amoungst a group of people. Finally, and perhaps this is a negative, but I enjoy the social niche of the /r/awwnime guys. It&#39;s kind of like the old YPN days in a way. To the original point of joining some organized, recurring group, I failed. But I think I made up for it in other regards. Either way, I&#39;m going to label this one as simply OKAY.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR DRAWING</strong> - A handful of comics notwithstanding, I hardly drew a single thing this year. FAILED</p>
<h2 id="onwards-towards-2013">Onwards Towards 2013</h2>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - The trend of exercise must maintain or increase. But, more importantly than that, my eating habits have got to change. The late night runs to McDonald&#39;s and Taco Bell <em>must stop</em>. I need to be making more meals at home and healthier meals at that. The goal I&#39;m going to set for myself is to be 200lbs when I sit down to write this post at the end of the year. That&#39;s 20lbs less than I am now, more than doable.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I made a lot of unnecessary purchases in 2013. <strong>A lot</strong>. I must make the note that never once did I spend outside of my means and am even ahead in YTD funds, but the amount of money I spent on anime alone could have paid off my credit card. Or a large chunk of the remaining loan on my car. That&#39;s just anime. Gaming purchases, random one-off items, and eating out combined probably rival that number a couple times over. My goal for this year is to pay off in full three major bills: car, credit card, and the LASIK loan. Between those three, that&#39;s an extra $600 a month that I can begin throwing at my insane student loan debt, the ultimate goal there being to have those paid off by 2018 at the very latest.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - This is something I actually attempted last year in earnest by trying to take a course at a local community college (an insane amount of very specific circumstances prevented my entry). I&#39;ve also made some lame attempts in the past to learn and can speak and write the language on a very, very basic level. However, I need to either shit or get off the pot, so I&#39;ve ordered myself some honest to god text books and will be giving this high focus this year.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - My two oldest brothers and I have been entertaining this one for years and, in hindsight, 2012 would have been the best year to pursue it. However, with us getting older and everybody losing time to responsibilities, it&#39;s only going to get more difficult from here out. I feel that if the trip doesn&#39;t happen in 2013, it may very well not happen at all.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing (yet again)</strong> - This has been on the list for three years running, now. However, my approach was wrong. My start and my goal were to draw comic and Japanese styles better when, in reality, I should be shooting to become a better over all artist. Aside from a self-defeatist attitude, not knowing what exactly to draw has also been a major problem which in turn leads to not drawing at all. So, what I&#39;m going to do this year is partake in the subreddit known as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/">SketchDaily</a>, wherein they provide a subject for you to sketch everyday. This is a good way to provide with something to draw and encourage persistence.</p>
<p>Finally, tying all of these things together will be <strong>PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY</strong>. It&#39;s easy to say you&#39;ll do something and then conveniently ignore it because you&#39;re the only one holding yourself accountable. For a better man, this is all you&#39;d need, but I am not a better man. I thrive off of public image much more than one should, but if it keeps me on the path I have laid out before myself, so much the better. So, I will be posting here the results from above in the form of weekly sketch dumps, what I&#39;ve learned in teaching myself Japanese, and maybe some periodic updates on exercise and the avoidance of cheap McDonald&#39;s food. Lying on the internet is easy, but luckily that&#39;s one vice I&#39;ve managed to rid myself of and lying to a bunch of people you know and talk to in person makes the whole thing a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve rambled on long enough. Congratulations on surviving the apocalypse and here&#39;s to a long and prosperous 2013!</p>
