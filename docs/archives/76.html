My ability to do so was actually big thing in math class the following month. Since then, I&#39;ve been improving upon my technique and now I&#39;m going to show you how to solve Rubik&#39;s Cube in ten seconds or less. Video after the break.

<p>Now, I realize that the &quot;system specs&quot; spewed forth in the above video were probably intentionally skewed so as to follow the whacky, 80s style zaniness, but as an uber nerd and somebody who&#39;s intimately familiar with NES hardware, I feel compelled to correct their errors.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #1: 3.58Mhz video core clock speed</strong>
The NES video processor, a Ricoh 2C02 &quot;Picture Processing Unit&quot;, or PPU, is actually clocked at 5.37Mhz. The CPU is exactly one third of this, or 1.79Mhz. The figure they&#39;re quoting is the timing of a color NTSC signal.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #2: 240x226 resolution</strong>
The PPU actually worked with an internal resolution 256x240, though most old TVs did not display the first and last eight scanlines effectively making the resolution 256x224. This was the same for both NTSC and PAL models.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #3: 16 sprite pixel depth</strong>
I don&#39;t even know where to begin on this one. Firstly, the NES had enough sprite RAM (object attribute memory, or OAM) for 64, 8x8 or 8x16 sprites. Secondly, every sprite could have three colors (four if you include transparency) from a palette of 53 colors. Every scanline could hae a maximum of eight sprites, and when this limit was exceeded some sprites were not drawn causing the infamous flicker. Finally, you could have a total of 25 colors per scanline. What the hell they were talking about to begin with baffles me, but there were no 16s involved there at all. Except maybe that internal 16-bit PPU register that could be written to through dual writes to address $2006....</p>
<p><strong>Claim #4: NES has a Zilog Z80 processor</strong>
This one&#39;s easy. The NES did not have a Z80. It had a Ricoh 2A03, which was a 6502 without decimal mode and a set of sound instructions. The Gameboy, however, had a Z80 and the Sega Genesis used one as its sound processor.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #5 It&#39;s an 8-bit system</strong>
Well, that&#39;s about the only thing they got right. Though, the system did have a 16-bit address bus....</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m finished. I&#39;m sure somewhere God has smote a kitten for my nerdy rantingness, but it had to be said and I said it. Caio.</p>

Of course, we should all know by now that CMS programming is child&#39;s play for me. However, seeing as my final project for this class _is_ a CMS with front end, I&#39;m taking this opportunity to redesign stuff, and by stuff I mean everthing (even beyond the site itself). Some things to expect from the next iteration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter integration on blog page</li>
<li>A proper portfolio</li>
<li>Accross the board branding</li>
<li>Page navigation</li>
<li>Probably more as I think of it</li>
</ul>
<p>If my rebrand goes as well as I hope, I shouldn&#39;t be updating the design for some time. Geez, we <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/more-site-updates">haven&#39;t</a> <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/the-new-design-is-here">heard</a> <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/redesign-the-reason"><em>that</em></a> before, have we?</p>

This was, of course, overshadowed by the awesomeness that was Flash. But I digress. At the end of this month our final 3D project wound up in an awesome culmination of 3D animation and my favorite motion program, After Effects. The result? See for yourself.</p>

Back in May that project was the <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/xbox-modding--an-epic-fight-an-epic-win/">Xbox mod</a>. This time around it was to build myself a new server after the last one I&#39;d been using overheated while I was away on vacation and the air conditioning was off (at least, that&#39;s my guess on the diagnosis). Of course, I would have liked to build something from scratch, but college funds being what they are that isn&#39;t always the most viable option. Instead, I took a trip up the the local TriftKo (yes, they spell it with a &quot;K&quot;) and picked up the cheapest (and at that time, only) computer they had. I really had no idea what kind of computer it was (though, I made a really close guess based on the ports on the back), but that didn&#39;t matter for my needs, namely, to run a web and file server.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a new computer I like to boot it in its &quot;virgin&quot; state to see what the computer is and what it was used for before it came into my possession (so far, I&#39;ve only found mild pron on one computer). After that, I take the thing apart and, dipping into the vast amounts of old computer parts available to me, upgrade it to make it as high tech as possible. After a long amount of research, trial and error, a BIOS upgrade, and some dabbling in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/grub4dos">GRUB for DOS</a> I was able to get the computer up to the following specs:</p>
<p>Pentium 166Mhz
64MB RAM
1.2GB Primary drive (still has Win98 on it)
4GB Secondary drive (running the latest Debian)
DVD-RW drive (which doesn&#39;t have any power since there are only two large molex adapters available)
Ethernet card
PCI USB 2.0 card</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a laughable computer to say the least and its age did prove to be more of an issue than I originally anticipated. The first was the inability to boot from CD even though the BIOS claimed to support it. I figured the old BIOS was the problem, so I set about trying to update it. Unlucky for me, IBM has pulled all BIOS upgrades for old systems off their site so I was stuck wading through forums. Once I got the BIOS upgraded it still wouldn&#39;t boot from CD, but it did correct an issue with identifying the 4GB drive (and now I have support for drives up to 8.4GB).</p>
<p>So, after all those many hours I was still unable to boot my Linux install CD. It was about then that I had the genius idea of copying the Linux kernel off of the install disc onto the Windows 98 drive and starting the installer in GRUB from DOS. Took a few tries to get off the ground, but it did wind up working. Things were looking great, then Linux took six or seven hours to install. I decided to sleep at this point.</p>
<p>Luckily, after Linux was installed and I got ssh up and running I could close the box, clean up the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/2716415642/">mess</a> that had appeared on the floor, and continue the finishing touches from the comfort of my laptop. Everything after that went pretty well, but there was still the issue of not being to use my 120GB hard drive full of stuff that I usually streamed to XBMC. Luckily, the fix for that was really, really simple. Buy a PCI USB card and use my external hard drive enclosure. For the first time in this entire project, and my entire time messing with Linux, it worked first crack out of the barrel without any extra configuration on my part (save changing my home directory mount in fstab).</p>
<p>So, it&#39;s been far more useful as of late, but I wanted to take it a step further. The box does have a sound card and seeing as it is sitting right next to my speaker system I figured &quot;Hey, why not use it as a stereo too?&quot; So, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing this evening. Getting the sound card to run was a bitch, especially with the little info I could find on the card itself. Looking through the startup messages it was being found as &quot;AT931 Audio 16&quot;. Google turned up two pages on that. It turns out the card is actually a OPTi 82c931, but even finding the correct module for that was a pain in the ass (it&#39;s snd-opti93x). After that, I followed <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-opti93x">this handy guide</a> on the AlsaProject wiki to get the rest up and running.</p>
<p>So now my computer plays sound which is pretty sweet. But, I&#39;m again being bitten in the ass by its age. If you try to do anything while playing an MP3, file access or an HTTP request, the audio starts lagging. So, I think I&#39;ve devised a clever way around said issue. I&#39;m going to write a series of scripts that will convert the MP3 to a wave file and play the wave (which requires almost no processor time). Couple that with a web interface for making playlists and it&#39;ll be the most kick ass twelve year old computer of all time.</p>
