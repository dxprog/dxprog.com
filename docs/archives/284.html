It isn&#39;t in my nature to swear, but I hate cart pushing. The last two nights layaway has been dead enough that they&#39;ve sent me out to push carts in the parking lot. I pushed carts in freezing weather for one and a half hours without a hat or gloves on Sunday and for an hour yesterday. Luckily I was smart enough to bring the hat and gloves then. I tell you though, if Wal-Mart calls me back in January and says they want me to be a cart pusher I will turn it down. There is no way in heck I would do that as my main job. There, now it&#39;s out :-P.</p>
<p>On the upside I&#39;ve got only $380 to go on my laptop. I&#39;ll get it out one week from Thursday. It seems like an eternity away, though. But, I&#39;ve been waiting years I think I can wait one more week. I think...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Return of the mad eBayer!</h2><time>November 29, 2005</time><div><p>Yes, it is I, insane Matt posting inane items on eBay! For those of you who don&#39;t know I am the creator of such infamous items as the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/cc.html">&quot;Common Cold&quot;</a> and the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/dv_pancake.jpg">&quot;Darth Vader Pancake&quot;</a>. However, this eBay auction is a little more sane... just a little. At the very least I&#39;m selling more or less a legitimate item... an e-mail address. That&#39;s right, loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com (yes, I actually managed to snag that address). I&#39;m hoping there are plenty of Zelda fans out there who&#39;d like this address and after an Xbox 360 gmail addy went for $570 how can I lose. It&#39;ll only be a quarter if I do :-P. But, anyways...</p>
<p>Thursday is pay day again. I&#39;ve made up a spreadsheet to keep track of my hours and take out all the proper taxes and according to that this paycheck will be about $316.60 (54 hours worked). I&#39;ve also calculated my current schedule through to the 15th and I&#39;ll have just enough to pull out my laptop! YAY! :-D</p>
<p>Later :-)</p>
