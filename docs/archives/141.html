Instead, today I&#39;m going to present to you some things I&#39;ve doodled at various points while at work. Sadly, some of my more epic doodles are in a different notepad and will not be presented here today, and seeing as I&#39;m on vacation for the next week I can&#39;t just wait until Monday to write this. But, enough said. The artwork is after the break.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_bullet.jpg" alt="" title="Mr. Bullet says...">I used to draw a lot of these little visual puns while in college. Had to keep the tradition alive.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_apollo.jpg" alt="" title="iObject">Sketched while I was waiting for my computer to boot. I was in the middle of completing all the Ace Attorney games back to back to back which was probably why it was on the brain that day.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_girl.jpg" alt="" title="Maya Fey?">I honestly don&#39;t even remember drawing this, but there it is. Not terrible, to be sure. Kind of looks like Maya from Ace Attorney, I guess.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_hanako_snow.jpg" alt="" title="Look familiar?">This was the doodle that directly inspired <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/because-its-far-too-warm-for-november/">this picture</a>. I&#39;m torn on which one is better.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_snowman.jpg" alt="" title="The flying sombreros are attacking! Somebody save the tacos!">Just randomness. In case you&#39;re wondering, the text says &quot;Snow-me-ha-me-ha!&quot;, a less than subtle nod to Dragon Ball Z</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Incriminating Evidence</h2><time>December 9, 2010</time><div><p>I do not have a strong love for my home city of Bartlesville. The citizens are a near fifty/fifty split of rich assholes and white trash (at least, that&#39;s what it seems), there are no decent places to shop and there are no good hang out spots. However, we are home to one thing of true magnificence: the <a href="http://www.bartlesvillelocomotive.org/">AT&amp;SF No. 940</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/bvl_train.jpg" alt="" title="A thing of beauty is a joy forever"></p>
<p>I&#39;ve thought that this train was the coolest thing in Bartlesville since the days I was first watching Thomas the Tank Egnine, back when it was rusting outside of a local park. A few years ago, while I was in Florida (dammit), the city moved the train to the old train station and it is now open for the public to go inside and climb all over. Truly a fantastic thing. However, it is also sad. This glorious machine, once a productive piece of history, has now been relegated to nothing more than a set piece for the town. And while this is better than rusting in a park, it&#39;s not all it could be. I have a solution for this.</p>
<p>I am going to restore and steal this train.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right. Should I ever come into a lot of money (by which I mean millions), I will fix this train up in the dead of night, move it onto the real train tracks that run adjacent and ride off into the sunset. It will be the most glorious thing of all time. A true romantic heist that you only see in the movies. Of course, it will lead to my arrest, but I can&#39;t help but think: what would the reaction be when I&#39;m charged with grand theft locomotive? What will they do with this now fully operational vehicle?</p>
<p>Of course, this is all a fantasy, but one I like to entertain often. Perhaps someday enough money will be raised to make it operational again and they can offer train rides to the tune of $10 per, but I feel that my grande heist will probably happen sooner.</p>
<p>Sleep well, sweet prince of the rails.</p>
