<p>Well, Christmas paper shredding has come and gone once again. All that excitement and anticipation over with the course of a couple hours. Ah, but a pretty sweet Christmas it was. So, I bet the question on the tip of your tounges is &quot;What&#39;dya get?&quot;. Here&#39;s the run down: glass chess set (frosted even :-D), laptop backpack, CF card reader/writer, a &quot;Pedro&#39;s Got your Back&quot; and a nice flannel shirt, some money and a gift card, a Dave Berry book, and the piece de resitance: my own cell phone :-D. Quite a cool one at that. Basic, but it suits my needs. Actually, truth be told, it does some stuff that my parents fancier phone doesn&#39;t do, namely the ability to use SMS web services (such as google). Quite sweet, quite sweet.</p>
<p>The last few days I&#39;ve been delving into GBA dev again and something seems to have finally clicked. I understand how loading sprites works and all that malarkey and so I&#39;ve begun my GBA Tetris Attack clone. And actually it&#39;s coming along quite nicely. Debugging is a pain in the but since I don&#39;t have a debug console or files to write ciritcal values to, but I&#39;m chugging along all the same.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if I haven&#39;t mentioned already, I go to discuss my future at Wal-Mart (Christmas Eve marked my last day in layaway). I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ll end up exactly, but at this point in time cart pusher seems most likely. Now I know I was complaining earlier, but I&#39;ve done it a couple of times since and I&#39;ll tell you that being able to use the QuickCart makes it a heckuva lot easier. My other option is cashier, but dislike that even more (though if it was back in electronics I might reconsider). I personally wouldn&#39;t mind working in claims or as an overnight stocker (both of which I have done). Whenever there was nothing to do in layaway after closing I&#39;d usually get sent to toys to help them stock and I must say it was a lot of fun (I did chemicals one night and I liked that too). So we&#39;ll just see tomorrow (and I&#39;ll post something about it).</p>
<p>Ah, but now it is getting late and I&#39;ve got presents to play with (maybe I&#39;ll go blow Jeff away in a game of chess). Stay tuned for an interesting video clip from yesterday morning. It&#39;s absolutely hilarious. Cheers!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/christmas-is-coming">Christmas is coming</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 20, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Twas some days before Christmas and all through the house,
not a creature was stirring except for the dudeon his laptop.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t rhyme, but I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m sitting here in our new living room lit up tree in front of me and a fireplace full of stockings to my right (picture coming soon). Now this in and of itself is a nice feeling but having my laptop and posting here while doing it makes the feeling cooler ;-). But anyhoo...</p>
<p>Christmas _is_ is coming and we&#39;ve been doing all the usual: making cookies, listening to Christmas music (even while I&#39;m at work :-D), buying gifts, etc. I&#39;d say that we&#39;re pretty much ready. The only bad thing is that Dad found the key to the freezer and I must go cookieless until Christmas Eve :-(.</p>
<p>Things in layaway have slowed down considerably. Thursday and Friday were a nightmare but since I couold count on my hands and toes how many people have come through to get stuff. Sunday night I began learning the how to operate the register and I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t want to do that (for reasons I don&#39;t want to go into again :-P). On Monday I&#39;ll be discussing my future at Wal-Mart with a manager and depending on if there&#39;s any other spots open or not I&#39;ll either be a cashier or a cart pusher. If I could do cashiering back in electronics I&#39;d probably leap on it, otherwise I&#39;ll probably push carts (unless overnight socker is available). But anyways, it looks like I&#39;m not even going to get laid off before coming back (I must have made a good impression).</p>
<p>But now I must go and make another attempt at finding the freezer key (or something :-P). Merry Christmas :-D</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/laptop-whoooo">LAPTOP!! WHOOOO!!</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 15, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Ah.... I sit in the living room in a nice comfy chair as I write this. Yes.. I got my laptop out this morning. I stayed up all night to do it, but I did it and DANGif it isn&#39;t a darn nice feeling :-). I&#39;ve got a bunch of junk I&#39;m going to need to uninstall (currently there are 14 icons down on the system tray :-P). But at least I&#39;ve got a processor/RAM combo that can handle a bunch of stuff :-D.</p>
<p>This is a bittersweet feeling, though, because today is the day that all Christmas layaway&#39;s are due out. It&#39;s probably going to be a hellacious afternoon/evening but at least I&#39;ll have something nice to come to tonight :-). That said, though, it may not be so bad because we&#39;ve got an orderly system in place. From what I understand I&#39;ll come in, pick up a car with somebody&#39;s layaway, get it and bring it in. That is a far cry from going to to get 5+ layaway&#39;s at a time :-P.</p>
<p>But, now I must fiddle with junk. BABEE! :-D</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/cart-pushing-sucks">Cart Pushing SUCKS!!!</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 6, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s right. It isn&#39;t in my nature to swear, but I hate cart pushing. The last two nights layaway has been dead enough that they&#39;ve sent me out to push carts in the parking lot. I pushed carts in freezing weather for one and a half hours without a hat or gloves on Sunday and for an hour yesterday. Luckily I was smart enough to bring the hat and gloves then. I tell you though, if Wal-Mart calls me back in January and says they want me to be a cart pusher I will turn it down. There is no way in heck I would do that as my main job. There, now it&#39;s out :-P.</p>
<p>On the upside I&#39;ve got only $380 to go on my laptop. I&#39;ll get it out one week from Thursday. It seems like an eternity away, though. But, I&#39;ve been waiting years I think I can wait one more week. I think...</p>

For those of you who don&#39;t know I am the creator of such infamous items as the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/cc.html">&quot;Common Cold&quot;</a> and the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/dv_pancake.jpg">&quot;Darth Vader Pancake&quot;</a>. However, this eBay auction is a little more sane... just a little. At the very least I&#39;m selling more or less a legitimate item... an e-mail address. That&#39;s right, <a href="mailto:loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com">loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com</a> (yes, I actually managed to snag that address). I&#39;m hoping there are plenty of Zelda fans out there who&#39;d like this address and after an Xbox 360 gmail addy went for $570 how can I lose. It&#39;ll only be a quarter if I do :-P. But, anyways...</p>
<p>Thursday is pay day again. I&#39;ve made up a spreadsheet to keep track of my hours and take out all the proper taxes and according to that this paycheck will be about $316.60 (54 hours worked). I&#39;ve also calculated my current schedule through to the 15th and I&#39;ll have just enough to pull out my laptop! YAY! :-D</p>
<p>Later :-)</p>
