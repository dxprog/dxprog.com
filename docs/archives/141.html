I may as well say I&#39;ve got a job (I have no doubt in my mind that I&#39;ll pass the drug/alcohol test). In fact, before taking the test today (yuck) I overheard the people in the back talking about how I was &quot;the only one today&quot; and that Wal-mart hasn&#39;t been &quot;getting any applications&quot;. They&#39;re deperate. They need me.</p>
<p>No updates on Ramboella as I can&#39;t find my darn Office CD key back (had it just last week :-P). I may mooch off my parents copy of 2K3 Pro (it is nicer) but I&#39;m going to have to do something and soon if I&#39;m going to be on the job 5+ hours a day.</p>

First of all I&#39;ve got an idea for a simple short film which I will probably be filming as soon as I finish the script. But until I can get a trailer up, you&#39;ll have to live with this poster:
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/ramboella.jpg" alt="" title="image">
I should be able to finish the script this week and start shooting next week. So keep coming back for updates.</p>
<p>Also, and this is the big news, but it looks like I may have a job pretty soon (as in an actual job). Last night I applied at Wal-Mart and I&#39;m already setup for an interview tomorrow. Now for the moment I may just have a temp job for the holidays (in the lawaway dept. of course :-P), but if I do my job well enough and with enough SpongeBob-like enthusiasm I probably have a chance of becoming a normal employee. We&#39;ll see, though. The good thing is is that I&#39;ll be making my own money pretty soon (can you spell laptop? :-D).</p>
<p>Well, it was nice to have something to post for a change (and good news at that). Just remember to keep your RSS reader up-to-date or check back for more information on... Ramboella!</p>

Not much new going on over here. I&#39;m still doing the Clear Creek site (sparked an idea for an ASP.NET wiki :-D). Also, did a bunch of work for the Schindler&#39;s again. Made a profitable $50 off of it which I&#39;ve promptly used to buy myself a 120GB hard drive. Oh, and I got a free $20 Amazon.com gift certificate for taking a [<a href="http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link]">http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link]</a> survey. I&#39;ll probably buy Episode III with that (totally free :-D).</p>
<p>Jeff bought Jedi Academy last week. Awesome, awesome game that one is. Never thought I could get into an FPS, but I did. It&#39;s $10 software so if you see it I recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>That seems to be all. I know, short entry for such a long reprieve. Until next time :-P</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/all-moved-in">All moved in</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 28, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Well, after a hellish last week we are all moved into our new house (when I say &quot;all moved in&quot; that means we live here, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean we&#39;re all unpacked :-P). It&#39;s wonderful. Our room is almost double the size of what we had and the backyard is superb (we&#39;ve been out at least twice everyday since we moved last Wednesday). Of course, there&#39;s been a few problems but all have now been worked out.</p>
<p>Last night I e-mail Phil Vischer, creator of the popular kids show VeggieTales, inquiring about how he rigged the veggies. To my surprise, waiting in my inbox this afternoon was a personal reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Matt,</p>
<p>When we produced the shows in Softimage, it was all lattice  deformation.  Each eye was in a lattice, and then the entire  character was in a lattice.  We just animated lattices.  The mouths  were simple texture maps created by a separate animation and applied  in rendering, and then reapplied slightly blurred as a bump map.   Very simple stuff.  (All developed in 1991 when I built Larry for the  first time.)</p>
<p>Virtually nothing changed until we moved to Maya in 2000.  By then I  was no longer animating, so I&#39;m not sure what they changed.  Now  everything is done in Canada, and I&#39;m clueless.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Phil
Talk about cool :-D. With that knowledge I can now finish my models for MeatStories (R) ;-).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also this afternoon I became the webmaster for a bunch of <a href="http://www.clearcreekmonks.org">monks</a>. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to call their &quot;outside guy&quot; to get a list of everything I need to do. I poked around their server a bit and it looks like I&#39;m going to have to do some ASP[.NET] work (which I&#39;d actually been tinkering with shortly before we moved), so that&#39;ll be fun (and bring back some memories).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for tonight. Now that my computer is setup again (with internet) I&#39;ll be making my usual every other day entry.</p>

The new Nintendo Revolution controller was finally unveiled. At first I was kind of skeptical, I mean the thing is a freakin&#39; remote:
<img src="http://cubemedia.ign.com/cube/image/article/651/651275/hands-on-the-revolution-controller-20050915054852879-000.jpg" alt="" title="image">
Part of me kind of died because I&#39;ve grown up holding a controller in two hands using super quick thumb reflexes to get myself around. However, the more I thought about the possibilities of the tilt sensors, the more I began to like it. One thing that I would love to see is a Star Wars lightsaber game. I was still kind of leery, but then I heard that there&#39;s a conventional controller that you can plug the remote into. Besides, I&#39;ll be able to play Tetris Attack, so I have to buy one whether I like the controller or note. Needless to say I really can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one of these and see how it works.</p>
<p>On the house front: A good 75-80% of the house is packed now. Mainly just the big things (furniture, appliances, computers, etc.) are left. Sometime tomorrow we&#39;ll be getting a dumpster and emptying the garage and packing the U-Haul. It&#39;s going to be a long, tiring week but it&#39;ll be well worth it.</p>
<p>As an interesting closer I post some things I&#39;ve unearthed (either through packing or cleaning up my computer):
