Mainly, if for any reason, it is because at our old house there were cats that made a permanent residence there. And when the males went around marking their territory, it wasn&#39;t pretty.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I have another reason to hate cats: It seems I&#39;m allergic to them. Yesterday I went to an allergist to see what the heck I&#39;m allergic to because I have nasty allergies at certain times of the year (and I&#39;ve got asthma so we were there for that too). Well, I went in and they poked my back with all sorts of pollens and stuff. It appears I&#39;m not allergic to anything organic (as in trees and such), just cats and dust mites (apparently I got a huge welt from the dust mite test). They also put me through a treadmill test to test my lung function and I got another surprise there. I&#39;m not asthmatic enough to even be labelled with having activity enduced asthma. So I&#39;m testing that by laying off my inhaler whilst being active and seeing what gives. I made it through bowling last night without a problem. Tomorrow when I go to work I won&#39;t &quot;deasthmaize&quot; and see how I do there.</p>
<p>Speaking of tomorrow it&#39;s my first payday (yay!). It&#39;s driving me insane to see how much I&#39;ve made in the last two weeks. I&#39;ll probably have a picture of me and my check stub up for you people :-)</p>
<p>In the land of NES development I&#39;ve gotten two opcodes interpreted but now I&#39;m stuck on something else: it seems I&#39;m not interpreting the ROM data right. I&#39;ve run my test ROM through a couple of disassemblers and they&#39;re reading the first four bytes in as something else (actually, the two disassemblers had different results. Go figure :-P). I&#39;ll have to do more research to figure this out. In the mean time you can read a blow-by-blow run-down of development <a href="http://www.youngprogrammers.net/index.php/CoolNES">here</a>.</p>

I&#39;ve done probably about everything, now, and seen just about everything put on layaway (except groceries). I&#39;m not sure what my standing is now, but I was already getting high praise on Monday (can&#39;t let it get to my head). Also, yesterday, the other layaway boy had his first day and I showed him the ropes. He&#39;ll be mainly working when I&#39;m not. Just some interesting stats that I&#39;ll be updating regularly. To date I&#39;ve boxed/binned the following:
4 GameCubes
1 GameBoy Advance SP
2 Xboxs
2 PlayStation 2s
1 Laptop</p>
<p>Quite fun, eh? Also, at the request of SeniorUSB, here is a picture of me in my &quot;little vest&quot;:

<p>One day after work I went to the electronics dept. to take a look at their laptops because apparently I&#39;ll get an extra 10% cupon for Christmas bonus. I didn&#39;t really expect to find anything aside from budget systems, but I found <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4228534">this</a>. With the exception of hard drive space it is more powerful than my desktop (which will become a file/web server). A feature I thought was kind of interesting was the fact that it can play DVD/CDs without even booting into Windows (save on battery life I&#39;m sure). But it will be nice to have a portable computing solution, not to mention just downright cool :-).</p>
<p>In programming land, I&#39;m currently working on trying to write an NES emulator. This is pretty much just for the learning experience to help understand the behind the scene ops of computers/game consoles. I hope that by learning that stuff I&#39;ll have a better understanding of current systems (GBA, GCN, etc.) and thus develop for them with little or no learning curve. I&#39;ve found a bunch of handy info at <a href="http://parodius.nesdev.com">NesDev.com</a> which is helping quite a bit and I more or less understand how the whole internal system works, but figuring how you load things in from ROM sill escapes me. Hopefully this time next week I&#39;ll have my mock 6502 running a few opcodes. I&#39;m mainly trying to get the thing to the point that I can run the original Mario Bros. which is fairly basic but it&#39;ll be a mighty cool feeling, I&#39;ll tell you now :-).</p>

Overall I think it went pretty well (except all the women&#39;s underwear I had to handle :-P). However, it&#39;ll be nice when I can go in there and know what to do instead of hanging around more seasoned coworkers and have them coach me through everything. </p>
<p>I just did the math and my first paycheck should be about $326.20. Figuring I get about that much every week (and those are only 25 hour work weeks, mind you) by the time Christmas is over I&#39;ll have around $1300! Enough to by myself that laptop :-D</p>
<p>In non-job related news, my Episode III DVD arrived today. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said it already, but I got it completely free all because I took a survey :-D. It doesn&#39;t get much sweeter than that. I&#39;ll probably watch it tonight and watch all the extras over the next few days. Ought to be a nice break from work :-).</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/windows-2003-troubles">Windows 2003 Troubles</a></h1><time class="post__published">October 30, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Well, yesterday was a great day... NOT! Somehow, and I&#39;ve yet been able to figure out why, my password got reset. Now I figure it&#39;s one of four scenerios:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> A little kid somehow changed the password by pounding on my keyboard
<strong>B)</strong> One of our neighbors has been sitting cracking our WPA passkey the last month (and I think that all of our neighbors have WiFi)
<strong>C)</strong> Some Uber h4x0r who&#39;s peed off at me snuck in via the internet and changed it hoping to make my life miserable
<strong>D)</strong> My SAM file got corrupted</p>
<p>D is the most likely scenerio, but you can&#39;t discount any of the others. Anyhoo, I spent most of yesterday figuring out how to undo it without reinstalling Windows. My first thought was to try the Linux distro <a href="http://cyti.latgola.lv/ruuni/index_en.html">austrumi</a> which has a utility called nt_pass (only in version 0.9.2, btw). Well, that didn&#39;t want to work because, gosh, my SAM file is read-only. Well what jerk wrote <em>that</em> program? :-P</p>
<p>So, I went and did some more searching and came across a little hole in the Windows Istaller. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> You&#39;ll need a Windows XP/2003 CD (any flavor: plain, SP1 or SP2) that&#39;s bootable (I &#39;spect most have this kind)
<strong>B)</strong> Boot with that and get to the point where you can repair a Windows install (Enter, Enter, F8, R I believe is the key sequence)
<strong>C)</strong> Just go along with that. Your computer will reboot and start the second half of the install.
<strong>D)</strong> Be paying atention to the progress bar in the lower left of the screen. When I says &quot;Install Devices&quot; hit F10. You&#39;ll be greeted by a command prompt which will allow you to do darn near anything you want.
<strong>E)</strong> In this particular case run the command &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; and a friendly box will come up where you can reset passwords, add users, etc.
<strong>F)</strong> Once you&#39;ve done whatever it is you&#39;re going to do let Windows finish installing or you&#39;ll lose everything you just did.</p>
<p>Needless to say that I created myself a new user account so I could leave the Aministrator one alone (&#39;tis one of the drawbacks to 2K3. You have to go using the command prompt just to get to a place to add a user :-P). But now I&#39;m back in business and everything works great. I hope somebody out there finds that useful because it sure was to me.</p>

I may as well say I&#39;ve got a job (I have no doubt in my mind that I&#39;ll pass the drug/alcohol test). In fact, before taking the test today (yuck) I overheard the people in the back talking about how I was &quot;the only one today&quot; and that Wal-mart hasn&#39;t been &quot;getting any applications&quot;. They&#39;re deperate. They need me.</p>
<p>No updates on Ramboella as I can&#39;t find my darn Office CD key back (had it just last week :-P). I may mooch off my parents copy of 2K3 Pro (it is nicer) but I&#39;m going to have to do something and soon if I&#39;m going to be on the job 5+ hours a day.</p>
