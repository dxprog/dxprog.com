<p>Anybody who watched Nickelodeon around the turn of the century will remember these Verb commercials, a ploy by the government to try to get fatass kids outside and active. One commercial in particular told you to &quot;pick a verb&quot;. Now, a verb is a word that expresses action or a state of being, not just something that denotes physical activity. There was an episode of Family Ties that had a rather humorous bit about how die could be a verb. But, I digress. If you go to the Verb <a href="http://www.verbnow.com">website</a> there&#39;s this creepy green chick dancing up in the top, left corner. I bet she chose smoke as her verb.</p>

So our tale of love and romance comes to a crashing conclusion... literally. Actually, this was the idea that inspired the whole idea in the first place.

It should be duly noted that Master Chief's real name is in fact John (or John-117). In the original comic it was just Chief, but at the prompting of a friend of mine it was changed to John. I figured he ought to know as he's finished both games and read the books (whereas I'm not even halfway through the first game. I just play multiplayer all the time).

I was thinking about having a Cortana episode where she's jealous and such, but drawing Master Chief is kind of a bitch (as you probably have figured out) so I'm wrapping it up here.

<p>Sitting on a cliff with your girl, watching as your home plant is about to be reft from the heavens. That&#39;s my idea of a first date ;-)</p>
<p>Oh, kudos to ffii on correctly identifying the title of the series. It is indeed the name of George McFly&#39;s book at the end of Back to the Future.</p>
