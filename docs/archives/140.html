NOT! Somehow, and I&#39;ve yet been able to figure out why, my password got reset. Now I figure it&#39;s one of four scenerios:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> A little kid somehow changed the password by pounding on my keyboard
<strong>B)</strong> One of our neighbors has been sitting cracking our WPA passkey the last month (and I think that all of our neighbors have WiFi)
<strong>C)</strong> Some Uber h4x0r who&#39;s peed off at me snuck in via the internet and changed it hoping to make my life miserable
<strong>D)</strong> My SAM file got corrupted</p>
<p>D is the most likely scenerio, but you can&#39;t discount any of the others. Anyhoo, I spent most of yesterday figuring out how to undo it without reinstalling Windows. My first thought was to try the Linux distro <a href="http://cyti.latgola.lv/ruuni/index_en.html">austrumi</a> which has a utility called nt_pass (only in version 0.9.2, btw). Well, that didn&#39;t want to work because, gosh, my SAM file is read-only. Well what jerk wrote <em>that</em> program? :-P</p>
<p>So, I went and did some more searching and came across a little hole in the Windows Istaller. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> You&#39;ll need a Windows XP/2003 CD (any flavor: plain, SP1 or SP2) that&#39;s bootable (I &#39;spect most have this kind)
<strong>B)</strong> Boot with that and get to the point where you can repair a Windows install (Enter, Enter, F8, R I believe is the key sequence)
<strong>C)</strong> Just go along with that. Your computer will reboot and start the second half of the install.
<strong>D)</strong> Be paying atention to the progress bar in the lower left of the screen. When I says &quot;Install Devices&quot; hit F10. You&#39;ll be greeted by a command prompt which will allow you to do darn near anything you want.
<strong>E)</strong> In this particular case run the command &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; and a friendly box will come up where you can reset passwords, add users, etc.
<strong>F)</strong> Once you&#39;ve done whatever it is you&#39;re going to do let Windows finish installing or you&#39;ll lose everything you just did.</p>
<p>Needless to say that I created myself a new user account so I could leave the Aministrator one alone (&#39;tis one of the drawbacks to 2K3. You have to go using the command prompt just to get to a place to add a user :-P). But now I&#39;m back in business and everything works great. I hope somebody out there finds that useful because it sure was to me.</p>

I may as well say I&#39;ve got a job (I have no doubt in my mind that I&#39;ll pass the drug/alcohol test). In fact, before taking the test today (yuck) I overheard the people in the back talking about how I was &quot;the only one today&quot; and that Wal-mart hasn&#39;t been &quot;getting any applications&quot;. They&#39;re deperate. They need me.</p>
<p>No updates on Ramboella as I can&#39;t find my darn Office CD key back (had it just last week :-P). I may mooch off my parents copy of 2K3 Pro (it is nicer) but I&#39;m going to have to do something and soon if I&#39;m going to be on the job 5+ hours a day.</p>

First of all I&#39;ve got an idea for a simple short film which I will probably be filming as soon as I finish the script. But until I can get a trailer up, you&#39;ll have to live with this poster:
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/ramboella.jpg" alt="" title="image">
I should be able to finish the script this week and start shooting next week. So keep coming back for updates.</p>
<p>Also, and this is the big news, but it looks like I may have a job pretty soon (as in an actual job). Last night I applied at Wal-Mart and I&#39;m already setup for an interview tomorrow. Now for the moment I may just have a temp job for the holidays (in the lawaway dept. of course :-P), but if I do my job well enough and with enough SpongeBob-like enthusiasm I probably have a chance of becoming a normal employee. We&#39;ll see, though. The good thing is is that I&#39;ll be making my own money pretty soon (can you spell laptop? :-D).</p>
<p>Well, it was nice to have something to post for a change (and good news at that). Just remember to keep your RSS reader up-to-date or check back for more information on... Ramboella!</p>

Not much new going on over here. I&#39;m still doing the Clear Creek site (sparked an idea for an ASP.NET wiki :-D). Also, did a bunch of work for the Schindler&#39;s again. Made a profitable $50 off of it which I&#39;ve promptly used to buy myself a 120GB hard drive. Oh, and I got a free $20 Amazon.com gift certificate for taking a [<a href="http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link]">http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link]</a> survey. I&#39;ll probably buy Episode III with that (totally free :-D).</p>
<p>Jeff bought Jedi Academy last week. Awesome, awesome game that one is. Never thought I could get into an FPS, but I did. It&#39;s $10 software so if you see it I recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>That seems to be all. I know, short entry for such a long reprieve. Until next time :-P</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/all-moved-in">All moved in</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 28, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Well, after a hellish last week we are all moved into our new house (when I say &quot;all moved in&quot; that means we live here, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean we&#39;re all unpacked :-P). It&#39;s wonderful. Our room is almost double the size of what we had and the backyard is superb (we&#39;ve been out at least twice everyday since we moved last Wednesday). Of course, there&#39;s been a few problems but all have now been worked out.</p>
<p>Last night I e-mail Phil Vischer, creator of the popular kids show VeggieTales, inquiring about how he rigged the veggies. To my surprise, waiting in my inbox this afternoon was a personal reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Matt,</p>
<p>When we produced the shows in Softimage, it was all lattice  deformation.  Each eye was in a lattice, and then the entire  character was in a lattice.  We just animated lattices.  The mouths  were simple texture maps created by a separate animation and applied  in rendering, and then reapplied slightly blurred as a bump map.   Very simple stuff.  (All developed in 1991 when I built Larry for the  first time.)</p>
<p>Virtually nothing changed until we moved to Maya in 2000.  By then I  was no longer animating, so I&#39;m not sure what they changed.  Now  everything is done in Canada, and I&#39;m clueless.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Phil
Talk about cool :-D. With that knowledge I can now finish my models for MeatStories (R) ;-).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also this afternoon I became the webmaster for a bunch of <a href="http://www.clearcreekmonks.org">monks</a>. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to call their &quot;outside guy&quot; to get a list of everything I need to do. I poked around their server a bit and it looks like I&#39;m going to have to do some ASP[.NET] work (which I&#39;d actually been tinkering with shortly before we moved), so that&#39;ll be fun (and bring back some memories).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for tonight. Now that my computer is setup again (with internet) I&#39;ll be making my usual every other day entry.</p>
