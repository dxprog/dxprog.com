Note - these rants are very, very biased.</p>
<p><strong>MySpace profiles</strong>. We&#39;ve given power to these people to change the design of their profiles. Bad idea. Why, you ask? Because it seems a good chunk of the MySpace population doesn&#39;t understand the basic fundamentals of good design. Readability is the first thing that comes to mind. Green text against some sort of fractal design background is enough to induce some sort of crack induced brain trip upon those who are to look upon it. I will say this: that horrible piece of shit you call a MySpace profile layout doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect upon you as a person. I say this because I&#39;ve got friends and family on MySpace. In closing, though, you can&#39;t expect the users of a place where they themselves have... questionable design practices to be better.</p>
<p><strong>Carts</strong>. Don&#39;t be a douche bag. Put the fracking carts in a damn cart corral. Never, EVER put your carts up on a curb or on the grass. I will kill you. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong>. Has this completely gone out the window? Seriously, since the advent of instant messaging and e-mail everybody&#39;s grammar and spelling are simply atrocious. Their, there, and they&#39;re are one of the worst offenders. Nobody knows how to properly spell angel (many times transposing the &quot;e&quot; and the &quot;l&quot;). Nobody cares. And to think is the next generation of human being that we will have to hand the keys of the world off to when my generation gets old. It sends shivers up my spine.</p>
<p>Well, I think that covers most bases. If I haven&#39;t offended you please feel free to e-mail me and I&#39;ll do my best to correct said situation next time I rant. Peace out!</p>

Now, for anybody who&#39;s been paying attention I haven&#39;t written a web engine since Tetra 2. The last time I worked on it was sometime back in &#39;05 I believe. Back then I was extremely proud of my little creation but I look back on it and think to myself &quot;that is one bloated piece of crap&quot;. It really was. Over 2500 lines of code. In comparison my new engine is only one or two hundred lines of code and almost as powerful (or it will be).</p>
<p>From a design standpoint Purple Fusion is way different from Tetra. Tetra was built around an object-oriented core. From an interface standpoint this was very clean. However, it did lend to some slowdown and made adding new modules cumbersome at best. It also limited what you could do with a module (to a degree). The new engine completely throws objects out the window (almost, the main class is PurpleFusion and that&#39;s the only one) and goes for a scriptable approach. Each page is it&#39;s own seperate page script that makes calls for getting data, displaying templates, etc. This makes creating new pages incredible quick and eliminates redundant code. Here&#39;s the script for the front page:</p>
<p><code>
&lt;page title=&quot;Home&quot;&gt;
    &lt;template:page_head&gt;
    &lt;db:entries limit=&quot;15&quot; sort=&quot;entry_date&quot; order=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;
    &lt;loop:entries&gt;
        &lt;dblink:category_name table=&quot;categories&quot; link=&quot;category_id&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field:entry_date type=&quot;date&quot; format=&quot;m-d-Y&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field:entry_body type=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;
        &lt;process:data&gt;
        &lt;template:entry&gt;
    &lt;end:loop&gt;
    &lt;template:page_foot&gt;
&lt;end:page&gt;
</code></p>
<p>As you can see it borrows from SGML&#39;s tag structure. Because of the tag structure it&#39;s very human readable and makes for quick prototyping. I&#39;m incredibly pleased with the way it&#39;s going right now and hopefully I&#39;ll have it running this site in a couple of weeks. Now that I think about it I could even speed things up by generating a cached version of the source code and just include that instead of parsing the page all the time. Yeah, this rocks.</p>

I haven&#39;t really put it out anywhere, but I&#39;ve had a <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> account for some time now. Like, almost a year. I put up some of my Matt (Digital Double) redesigns and promptly forgot about it. Well, since I&#39;ve been drawing all this stuff lately I&#39;ve been posting again and garnering some attention. Attention like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Dude, you don&#39;t have enough pageviews for the time you&#39;ve been to DA and the quality of your stuff. I&#39;ve only been here for a few weeks and I have more than triple your pageviews, it&#39;s annoying. Do more art! I less than three your style. = P&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s like a kick to the balls and at the same time it&#39;s nice. He obviously thinks highly of my artwork, but the whole &quot;d00d! I&#39;m teh n00b and teh p0puler and you teh arnt&quot; hurts slightly. He (I assume it&#39;s a guy) does have a point that I need to more art. One thing that baffles me, though, is that last sentence. The world may never know...</p>

This time I&#39;m doin&#39; Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the <strong>best</strong> artwork I&#39;ve ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are <strong>FIVE</strong> fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn&#39;t entirely faithful to the <a href="http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg">source material</a>, but I&#39;m really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin&#39; awesome.</p>
