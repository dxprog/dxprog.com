<p>Today&#39;s escapade into laziness calls to mind that, yes, I have been working at the mines of Wal-Mart one year today.</p>
<p>And as for keeping the customer&#39;s ignorant, it&#39;s true. We cater to their every whim and at some point, when they can no longer think for themselves, the cashier&#39;s of the earth will rise up and take control and we shall see a new era... an era of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>Oh, be sure to check out today&#39;s <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/73788/">comic</a>. After the last one, understandable by all, I bring you one which maybe five people in the whole world will get. Go me!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said or not, but I&#39;m currently in the middle of my two week hiatus from Wal-Mart (unpaid, sadly, but I&#39;m not one to quibble when it means two weeks of care free goodness). One of the things I vowed to do in my two weeks of freedom was teach myself how to play piano. Overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s going pretty well and having a keyboard that totally rocks helps ;-). But don&#39;t take my word for it, here&#39;s me playing a little piece of Zelda music (actually, I&#39;ve been passively working on learning this piece for over a year :-P):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJCFtI9wjcQ"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJCFtI9wjcQ/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that by next summer I&#39;ll be proficient enough to play the song in its entirety (without screwing up) along with some others (Final Fantasy X&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty8PPnrKY0w">To Zanarkand</a> being of them).</p>
<p>Speaking of FFX, I am currently enjoying being beaten by the game. The story started off kind of slow (almost to the point of me deciding never to play again), but it&#39;s picked up to the point of having me completely sucked in. So I&#39;ve been playing a bit lately (excluding all my annihilations I believe my play time is somewhere around 26 hours) and hopefully I&#39;ll have beaten the stupid thing before I have to go back to work (at which point I&#39;ll start playing FFX-2).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started on a DS game. That&#39;s all I&#39;ll say because I tend to make these announcements with all sorts of grandiose promises and give up after about five minutes of coding. Yeah... it&#39;s dumb.</p>
<p>Okay, now you&#39;re all caught up for the next several months. I&#39;ll probably post something again before I go to college next fall.</p>

<p>No comment on this one.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that I&#39;ll be going to a once a week Saturday update for a while. Trying to do two comics a week with work and all the other stuff I do is kind of a strain. So, yeah.</p>

<p>Sorry for it being late. I&#39;m now on Linux and I&#39;ve yet to get my scanner or wacom working so making comics is a going to be a little complicated until I do.</p>
<p>Not much to say about the comic, so I won&#39;t.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to update again on Friday. I have some scans that I can  use until I get everything working the way they&#39;re supposed to.</p>
<p>P.S. Comments are working again. I&#39;m just letting wordpress handle it all since I&#39;ve got more spam squashing options there.</p>
