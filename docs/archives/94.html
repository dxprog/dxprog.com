<p>It would seem that while I was away at college, my brother Steve saw fit to claim my property as his own and pour his own thoughts on paper. As payback for soiling my stuff, I will dump the best entries here. HAHA!</p>

<p>Today was hectic. I woke up about 11:00 o clock. We had lunch. Then Mom and me went to pick up Verna. I had to go because Mom wanted to get me some new mass shoes because I had to serve tonight.  Mom bought a 60 pair of shoes. So we went to Wal Mart just in case we could find anything cheaper (and better). We found a pair but we didn&#39;t get them. Then we got me a mass shirt. Then we went. When it was time to go I put on all me new stuff. We got me socks to. Then we went. When we got outside I said shotgun first but didn&#39;t get to sit up front!! &gt;:( !!! When we got to church Mom escorted me to the sacristy. There I put on a cassick, surplice, and a cape. Father Festas was ate so immediately after he got dressed mass started. As we were walking down the aidle deacon Joe noticed that my cape was inside out. Well that really stank. After mass I put out the candles but I didn&#39;t put out the advent wreath candles because I didn&#39;t think I was supposed to. Then we went home. Dad got Taco Bell for supper because we hadn&#39;t had any supper because mass was at 5:15. Then we watched the Santa Claus. While mom and I were shopping everyone made peppermint bark. Well my hand is killing me now so I&#39;ll quit.[/quote]</p>
<p>Funnily enough, out of the sixteen entries he wrote, this is the only one that doesn&#39;t end in the phrase &quot;Well, that&#39;s it&quot;.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting (or perhaps disconcerting) is the fact that his prose is nigh identical to my own in my first few entries. Those three word sentences are poetic beauty. Granted, he was only eleven at the time of these writings whereas I was thirteen. Perhaps I was a little behind the curve...</p>
<p>He&#39;s made up for it in the five years since, though. He recently entered a <a href="http://balmoraman.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4thww5">piece</a> into a writing contest held by the local library and took away <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2012/04/friday-at-last/">second place</a> (netting him a not too shabby $50 prize). More than I can say for myself at that age.</p>
<p>At sixteen I was busy destroying the YPN...</p>

<p>Well today was my birthday. Sixteen at last. While today was great, it was kind of odd too. It started off with me getting up at three AM. I checked my mail and watched cartoons. Jeff joined about four-thirty. While he was watching cartoons, I worked on my new VB site, Visual Basic Gaming Universe. My intent is to join the VB gaming webring, and maybe win an award. I fell asleep on the couch and didn&#39;t wake up until about ten or so. After I got dressed and ate, I started on my cake. Unfortunatly, I messed that one up. So mom rushed out and got a couple more boxes of mix and that one went okay. While that was baking, we had lunch. Then mom went out to take some newspapers to ARC, while Jeff, Chris and I picked up. When mom got back, she and I rushed right back out to get a camera. When we got back, I frosted my cake and Grandma came a few minutes after that. We had the normal ritual of opening presents. No duh! :) From Mom, Dad, and the rest I got a really cool pocket knife, Dr. Mario, this journal, and the Ep II soundtrack, and from Grandma I got thirty bucks. After Grandma left, Mom let me work on VBGU some more. Then she and Dad did shopping. When they got back I played some Dr. Mario. Joey jumped on me and I hurt him so I got in trouble. After that I went to our room and was sleeping until about now. So it was a pretty good day overall.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not much to say here, though my acceptance of commas in the year between journal entries is certainly welcomed. I still seem unable to write a non-disjointed narrative, though. It&#39;s disconcerting to say the least.</p>
<p>Also, webrings...</p>
