I haven&#39;t really put it out anywhere, but I&#39;ve had a <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> account for some time now. Like, almost a year. I put up some of my Matt (Digital Double) redesigns and promptly forgot about it. Well, since I&#39;ve been drawing all this stuff lately I&#39;ve been posting again and garnering some attention. Attention like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Dude, you don&#39;t have enough pageviews for the time you&#39;ve been to DA and the quality of your stuff. I&#39;ve only been here for a few weeks and I have more than triple your pageviews, it&#39;s annoying. Do more art! I less than three your style. = P&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s like a kick to the balls and at the same time it&#39;s nice. He obviously thinks highly of my artwork, but the whole &quot;d00d! I&#39;m teh n00b and teh p0puler and you teh arnt&quot; hurts slightly. He (I assume it&#39;s a guy) does have a point that I need to more art. One thing that baffles me, though, is that last sentence. The world may never know...</p>

This time I&#39;m doin&#39; Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the <strong>best</strong> artwork I&#39;ve ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are <strong>FIVE</strong> fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn&#39;t entirely faithful to the <a href="http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg">source material</a>, but I&#39;m really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin&#39; awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Ashe.png"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Ashe.png" alt="" title="Lady Ashe"></a></p>
<p>Overall I&#39;m pretty pleased with it. It&#39;s a far sight better than the original pencil art I had. However, the top part of the body seems to be a bit too small compared to everythiong else. But, considering I don&#39;t draw girls very often I&#39;ll give myself a break. I suppose it&#39;s one of those things I&#39;ll need to work on eventually.</p>
<p>This whole mess of pictures actually comes from one piece of art I&#39;d drawn a while back for a comic (the point of which now escapes me). I&#39;ve enjoyed being able to make purty art again and I may keep it up just to keep me busy until September.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#39;ve begun searching for a roommate. I&#39;ve e-mailed a couple guys now and I hope to hear back from some one. Also, I&#39;m pretty darn sure that I&#39;ll be adding animation as a second degree. Drawing these pictres has really hit home that, hey, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bad of an artist and, most importantly, I had a hell of a time doing it. So I&#39;ll need to e-mail them and see how much it&#39;ll cost me to tack that on. That&#39;d also mean spending twice as long at school, but it&#39;s so freakin&#39; cool that&#39;s hardly a problem ;-).</p>

Currently I&#39;m working on picking out a roommate and after that we&#39;ll work on finding an apartment. Then I&#39;ll need to secure funds and come September 20th[ish] I&#39;ll be moving my stuff out there. So nothing new on that front, I&#39;ll move on to other things. Actually, I lied. I got a call from them the other day making sure I wanted to take the Digital Arts and Design degree because they think I&#39;d be happier in Animation (I promptly said I&#39;d be happy <em>anywhere</em> in that school). But I had actually been thinking of double majoring in either DAD and film or animation and the more I think about it animation and art as a whole has always been a big love of mine so I&#39;m giving that some serious thought.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently getting ready to do another film project this time spoofing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents">Elite Beat Agents</a>. I&#39;d give off more but I don&#39;t want to ruin anything. I&#39;ll be trying out greenscreen stuff for this. It seems <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> now has the ability to do professional green screen removal (with a little finagling) so I&#39;m going to try that out. In particular I&#39;ll be filiming seperate elements against the screen and combining them into one shot. But I have yet to actually build the thing, something I was going to do on days off (Tuesday and Wednesday) but I felt too lazy to drive out to Lowes to buy the stuff. I suppose I&#39;ll do it next week and in the meantime I can flesh out a script. This is something I don&#39;t do often because I have the vision in my head pretty clearly and I don&#39;t want to go through the trouble of writing or storyboarding it out. I&#39;m lazy that way and it&#39;s something I&#39;ll have to get over before I go to Full Sail.</p>
<p>I completed two games this week (the world must be ending). The first one was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Paper_Mario">Super Paper Mario</a> (Wii). It was, as I thought it would be, a comepletely enjoyable experience. The dialoge was top notch, as always, packed with plenty of laughs. The flip mechanism never got old and was always used cleverly. The story line was fairly predictable (I had the ending figured out about half way through). However, next to Zelda it&#39;s the best single player game out there for the Wii so if you own on I&#39;d suggest picking this up.</p>
<p>The second game I completed was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Justice_for_All">Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All</a> (DS) which, I admit, I probably enjoyed <em>more</em> than SPM. It&#39;s definitely not a game you buy for the graphics or sound because they&#39;re meh at best (the art&#39;s not bad, I will admit). What is crucial to this game is story and it delivers 110%. The first case, being the introductory one, wasn&#39;t the greatest but it gets you into the swing of things well enough. The second case was awesome, and probably one of my favorites. The third case had me stumped (to the point of <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">cheating</a>; I&#39;m ashamed). The last case was simply amazing. Just when you think you had it figured out everything was turned on end. They also introduced some things that made things harder and raised moral questions. To say that this game on a whole was absolutely phenomenal is an understatement. If you like story type games (RPGs, text-adventures) you absolutely have to buy this game. If you&#39;re more an action type gamer you probably wouldn&#39;t enjoy it much, but rent it at least. It&#39;ll do you some good. On that note I&#39;ll be buying the first game and third when it comes out.</p>
<p>Now that all that&#39;s out, I&#39;ll leave you with this piece of art I finished this afternoon. Cheerio!</p>
