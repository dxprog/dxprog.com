<p>Not going to put a whole bunch of useless text on this one, however I will explain things a bit. This is yet another project for motion graphics. The criteria on this one was to create a commercial for a demographic outside of my own. So, I decided to market Full Sail to women (because we don&#39;t have near enough). Enjoy.</p>

Hard to believe it&#39;s already been half a year. Time does fly when you&#39;re having fun. But that&#39;s hardly why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>For MGR, our final project was to create a magazine layout and thirty second animation for a product, service, etc. I had a few ideas for mine before settling on something that was close to me: Crayola crayons. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve never really touched much on my artistic background, but I&#39;ve always had a box of Crayons crayons handy. I can remember buying crayons with my birthday money (it was the only time I ever had any) many times. Also, whenever we&#39;d take a trip to visit my grandparents I&#39;d always be drawing stuff with a bowl of crayons that my Grandma would set out. Even now, sitting next to me on my desk is a box of 64 Crayolas, and they&#39;re not unused either. And, for the record, those other brands aren&#39;t really crayons. Crayola&#39;s have a distinct smell, texture, and feel that has not been duplicated by anybody else. I don&#39;t mind spending a little extra for them. Upon opening the box and getting a whiff, I am suddenly a little kid, lying on the floor doodling and day dreaming away as only the innocent can.</p>
<p>But, enough of the schmaltzy stuff. Before you can watch the video you must see the ad. It kind of sets the mood.</p>

<p>And, now, for the coup de gracie. Enjoy!</p>

<p>As of the beginning of this month I began my foray into the wondrous world that is motion graphics. Our first project was to make a ten second bumper advertising ourselves or a &quot;company&quot; that represented ourselves. I was originally going to use my name and try to brand myself as myself, but it was advised by an instructor that I brand myself under a pseudonym, at least for the remainder of school, so as to have something that gives a lasting impression. I decided to play off of my more or less established internet moniker, dxprog, and came up with dx productions. Grab yourself some popcorn and prepare to be sold my awesomeness.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/internet-rule-48-is-defined-herein">Internet Rule #48 is Defined Herein</a></h1><time class="post__published">February 12, 2008</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>If you&#39;ve been around the internet as much as I have you&#39;ll probably know that it has it&#39;s own set of rules. Of these rules, #34 is most famous. Rule #34 states:</p>
<p><strong>If it exists, there is porn of it.</strong></p>
<p>Unwanted results from an innocent Google image search is enough to say that this rule is nearly one hundred percent true. However, there is no definition for something that&#39;s even more true than rule #34 (luckily, it&#39;s also more safe for work). I hereby decree that Internet Rule #48 will be defined as:</p>
<p><strong>If it exists, there is anime of it.</strong></p>
<p>This rule can be nearly solely confirmed by one website: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a>. For anybody who has never really scoured the annals of dA, it should be noted that almost 90% of everything posted is anime or some lame attempt at anime. A good chunk of this is fan art of just about anything. It doesn&#39;t matter what TV show, movie, comic, game, or person it is or is from. If they exist, somebody has drawn it in anime form. Let&#39;s get to proving using five examples from each stated category.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. Anything under the sun has anime art made of it, and nearly all of it can be found on deviantArt. So, let the internet propogate with the wisdom that is Internet Rule #48.</p>
