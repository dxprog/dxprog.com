Unfortunately, I was snubbed there and didn&#39;t have my writings brought to a larger than usual mass, but as I was planning on ranting about that topic on my blog anyways, I shall put it here regardless. (Damn you, Answerman!!!)</p>
<p>The question put forth was thus:
[quote]How open are you about your anime love with friends, family, and colleagues? Do you wear anime cloting, or read manga on your break? Be honest, damn it![/quote]</p>
<p>His incorrect spelling of &quot;dammit&quot; notwithstanding, here was my response:</p>
<p>[quote]When it comes to sharing my feelings of the various Japanese related media that I ingest on a day-to-day basis, I&#39;m really very open. After all, why is it that just because a person likes media from a different country, they should be ashamed? For that matter, why are they persecuted? People who really enjoy sports or cars or anything &quot;normal&quot; don&#39;t have to face this problem, but they&#39;re doing the exact same thing we &quot;otaku&quot; do; follow, enjoy and obsess over their particular subject of interest. I suppose it&#39;s the &quot;die hards&quot; that taint the perception of the anime crowd, but aren&#39;t we all annoyed by that one person who won&#39;t shut up about his obsession (whatever it may be)? But, now I&#39;m delving into another topic all together.
I enjoy my anime, my manga, and Japanese culture in general and I&#39;m not afraid to share that enjoyment with those I&#39;m with. But, at the same time, I try to keep in mind that they may not enjoy the subject as much as I do and adjust my level of enthusiasm accordingly.[/quote]</p>
<p>One thing I did not mention, but was actually a driving force for me writing something in the first place, is a nerd&#39;s treatment of another type of nerd. To rant about somebody else&#39;s fanboyish obsessions while you yourself are guilty of the same crime, though it may be in a different field, should be punishable by damnation. Granted, I myself am guilty of this, but there it is.</p>
