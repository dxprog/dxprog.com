<p>Holy fish, Batman! Two comics within a week! As can be seen my inks have vastly improved over my last <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/196367/">endeavor</a>. I&#39;m really pleased with how this turned out. Even the musculature looks decent. The only thing lacking, and this goes for most all my comics, is the lack of background scenery in panels 1 and 4. But I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p>Oh, since you can probably get Crackdown cheap at used game stores, you should pick up a copy. It&#39;s an awesome game. I actually had more fun playing that than I did the Halo 3 beta (mainly because I suck at Halo).</p>

Of course, that&#39;s a mouthful of words right there so their brilliant marketing team reduced it down to &quot;bogo&quot;. However, when spelled back out it&#39;s Buy One Get One which is clearly a lie. It should be &quot;bogoho&quot;, but then I guess it sounds like some black guy ordering his prositutes around. Yo! Bo go, ho!</p>
