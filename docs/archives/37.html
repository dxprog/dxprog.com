<p>As it turns out, FedEx delivers Tuesday through Saturday, so my lost weekend is less so.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been wanting a decent camera for some time as the point and shoots do not deliver the kind of quality I would prefer (and tend to fall apart rather quickly). I was actually planning on picking up a dSLR last year before the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/from-the-con-floor-day-1/">anime convention</a>, but, I couldn&#39;t find one for a decent enough price that also did video. The answer to that problem, apparently, is to simply wait a year.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now - still wanting a good camera for the con - and the camera I&#39;ve purchased, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J3V90Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p421_d6_g421_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=19H1SBQ8D7AXT6FGWZCS&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938811&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Canon Rebel T3i</a> retails for $750, well under the lower end numbers from last year. Toss in some clever shopping about and selling off of soon-to-be deprecated hardware (my old camcorder), and that $750 is brought down to a much more tolerable $350.</p>
<p>Even at $750, it would have been worth every goddamn penny. The picture above was taken with the flash <em>off</em> in my poorly lit bathroom. AND IT STILL LOOKS AMAZING (my troll face notwithstanding)!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not yet played around with the video option much, but expect some new movies this month now with fancy, movie style <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzC0Ek6X5FY">rack focus</a>!</p>

So, tonight I&#39;ll just repost this comment I left on reddit some days ago (because that&#39;s what we do):</p>
<p>My moronic roommate had invited some person from his class to stay at our place. I already hated my roommate, but I was in my last few months of college and it meant paying less, so I agreed to it.
Few days later, he&#39;s helping move the new guy&#39;s stuff in when he waddles into my room (overweight) all red in the face and out of breath. He asked if I would help get a couch up the stairs (we were on the second floor of the apartment complex). I reluctantly agreed and went out to help.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, I must explain how the stairs were laid out in the complex. There were two sets of stairs up: one with a bend half way up and one that went straight up. Here&#39;s a handy diagram:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1XpZX.jpg" alt="" title="A Diagram"></p>
<p>Gradients are stairs, red arrows how one gets up them.</p>
<p>So I walk out and see that they&#39;re trying to take the couch up the set of stairs with the bend and they were stuck getting it around the last corner. This is idiotic in and of itself as they could&#39;ve taken the straight stairs up and encountered no issues. It was the system of ropes and winches that literally caused my jaw to drop as I stared in disbelief for nearly a minute. The couch was actually dangling above the ground, anchored from the stairs going to the third floor.</p>
<p>I did wind up helping them get around the corner and immediately retreated to my room still in disbelief.</p>

The specifics are a bit complex to go over here, but at its core, he wasn&#39;t mentally picture the structure of an array correctly and so was reading his array&#39;s wrong causing them to display as if they were rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really remember having any issues when dealing with arrays, though these days, I generally stick to single dimensional arrays and use math if I need to convert from, say, a screen coordinate to its corresponding spot in the data structure. Particularly, and in the case of our argument, we were talking about reading in a map file. That got me thinking about this trinket I wrote several years ago.</p>

<p>If I recall, this test was more about scripted AI and platform physics, but there was a loadable map aspect as well. Maps are something I&#39;ve played around with for a very long time, one of my first programming mental puzzles being how to generate one that wasn&#39;t gibberish programatically. This was something that baffled me for the longest time, but I eventually did figure something out and even wrote a <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/randmaps.html">tutorial about it</a>.</p>
<p>But, really, this whole little tale and code offering are because I had no idea what to talk about otherwise. I suspect I shall have less issues tomorrow (for reasons that will become clear), but that hardly helps me in the here and now.</p>

Gently."></p>
<p>Here we are at day three and already I&#39;m forced to talk about the death of things dear to me. No, not Andy Griffith (though, I did see my fair share of him when my dad went through his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series">Matlock</a>) phase in the early 90s).</p>
<p>For over half a decade, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> has been the sight that has greeted me as I started my browser and many times when I clicked the &quot;home&quot; button of my browser (a button I&#39;ve had to explicitly enable in Chrome). But soon, this will be <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html">no more</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;d had a hunch that iGoogle was getting less than stellar treatment lately as it became very difficult to make iGoogle my default page for google.com and also when its design was broken through their extensive redesigning. Perhaps the personal web portal is passe at this point, but I will surely miss it. iGoogle has provided me with an at-a-glance preview of my mail and a handful of other website snippets since its inception in 2005.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&#39;ve been using less and less of the gadgets (or whatever they call them), slowly being culled down from my email and RSS feeds from various websites and webcomics to just mail, a deviantArt gadget that I don&#39;t pay attention to anymore, and the RSS feed from my <a href="http://www.square-headed.com/">brother&#39;s comic</a>. Outside of the casual overview of my email, I don&#39;t really take advantage of functionality of iGoogle anymore as I&#39;ve moved away to better, dedicated applications and sites such as <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and the ever present <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, I&#39;m a programmer, dammit! I can build myself a site that not only provides the same functionality I used before, but make it better, faster, stronger, and more tailored to my needs! I have sixteen months to replace the death row inmate that is iGoogle and replace it I shall.</p>
<p>I shall...</p>
