A comma delimited string of frames would be passed in to the function and the score of said string would be returned.</p>
<p>My first step to this was to write, in normal code, a function that would do just that:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">dxprog</span><span class="hljs-params">($game)</span> </span>{
    $game = explode(<span class="hljs-string">','</span>, $game);
    $len = count($game);
    $i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    $score = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    $frame = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> ($frame &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10</span>) {
        $frame++;
        $score += $game[$i];
        $next = $i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span> &lt; $len ? $game[$i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] : <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        $next2 = $i + <span class="hljs-number">2</span> &lt; $len ? $game[$i + <span class="hljs-number">2</span>] : <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ($game[$i] == <span class="hljs-number">10</span>) {
            $score += $next + $next2;
            $i++;
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ($game[$i] &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10</span> &amp;&amp; $game[$i] + $next == <span class="hljs-number">10</span>) {
            $score += $next;
            $score += $next2;
            $i += <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            $score += $next;
            $i += <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
        }
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> $score;
}
</code></pre>
<p>496 characters. Obviously, the next step was to minify that code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">dxprog</span><span class="hljs-params">($game)</span> </span>{
    $g=split(<span class="hljs-string">','</span>,$game);$l=count($g);$i=$s=$f=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>($f&lt;<span class="hljs-number">10</span>){$f++;$s+=$g[$i];$n=$i+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>&lt;$l?$g[$i+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;$n2=$i+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>&lt;$l?$g[$i+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>($g[$i]==<span class="hljs-number">10</span>){$s+=$n+$n2;$i++;}<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>($g[$i]&lt;<span class="hljs-number">10</span>&amp;&amp;$g[$i]+$n==<span class="hljs-number">10</span>){$s+=$n+$n2;$i+=<span class="hljs-number">2</span>;}<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{$s+=$n;$i+=<span class="hljs-number">2</span>;}}<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> $s;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That brings us down to 232 characters. All of the minification was done by hand and now began the task of trimming as many characters as I could. Any reduction in characters, no matter how few, was welcomed. I reviewed my logic, rolled together declarations where I could and came up with the following 186 characters:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">dxprog</span><span class="hljs-params">($game)</span> </span>{
    $g=split(<span class="hljs-string">','</span>,$game);$l=count($g);$i=$s=$f=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>($f&lt;<span class="hljs-number">10</span>){$f++;$s+=$x=$g[$i];$o=$i+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>&lt;$l?$g[$i+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;$n=++$i&lt;$l?$g[$i]:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>($x==<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)$s+=$n+$o;<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{$s+=$n;$i++;$s+=$x+$n==<span class="hljs-number">10</span>?$o:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;}}<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> $s;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This challenge was pretty interesting because it required me to think in ways I never have before. In PHP, there&#39;s little reason to write small code, and in JavaScript, I&#39;ll just run it all through something like <a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home">Closure Compiler</a>, so this was something entirely new. What really helped reduce the code in the end was eliminating conditional branches that did the same thing (ternaries also helped immensely).</p>

<p>So, in the stead of a video, here are photos of the peanut butter cookies I made after midnight last night. I had a hankering for cookies and, seeing as I have barred myself from stepping foot back in Wal-Mart again this week, conjured these up. I make the rules and if I decide I want cookies, I&#39;ll make some cookies regardless of the hour.</p>

This reminded me of the big stink that nerds raised last year on 11-11-11 and how it was the &quot;last binary date of our generation&quot;.</p>
<p>But, nerds. You should know this wasn&#39;t true.</p>
<p>Yes, 111111 is 63 and, no, we&#39;re never going to encounter a date like that again in our lifetimes or in the next thousand years, for that matter. But for any nerd to try and assume that 11-11-11 is a valid date is stupid. There was this little thing a few years ago called Y2K.</p>
<p>You may recall it.</p>
<p>The whole issue with Y2K, for those who don&#39;t recall or never knew, was in the data depiction of years in a date. The first two digits were discarded and only the last two saved. Computers automatically stuffed a &quot;19&quot; in front and called it a day. Obviously, when those two stored digits were &quot;00&quot;, all the dates would read 1900 and there would be mass pandemonium.</p>
<p>But, since the crossing of the (almost) new millennium, we&#39;ve had to differentiate by storing the entire date, meaning all years would be stored/displayed as a four digit number.</p>
<p>So, in nerd terms, there never <em>was</em> a 11-11-11, just 11-11-2011 (or, 20111111 if you like being able to sort your dates numerically). And now that we can store dates ranging from 1/1/0001 to 12/31/9999, there was no excuse for the &quot;whooaaahh&quot; moment.</p>
<p>Now, January 19, 2038 03:14:08? <em>That&#39;s</em> something to look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">forward to</a>.</p>

It&#39;s a great place for comedy, feels, and elitism. As it turns out, it&#39;s also a great place for crazy awesome food ideas such as <a href="http://imgur.com/a/avjMU">pizza cupcakes</a>.</p>
<p>That photo series is scant on details, but there&#39;s really no recipe to follow here. I used the recipe on the back of a package of pizza yeast, stuffed into muffin tins, and filled with deliciousness - pizza sauce, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, and mozzarella (the stuff you find in the hispanic section, not shredded). Stuff in a 400F oven for 10-15 minutes (depending on how you like your crust) and you get amazingness:</p>
