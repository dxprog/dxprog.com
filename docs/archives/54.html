<p>Once upon a time, I used to enjoy the snow. My brothers and I would make giant snow forts using spare laundry detergent buckets and then spend the next several days pummeling these impenetrable <em>fortrii</em> with the meanest snowballs we could conjure up. Snow was indeed a wondrous thing, but not so much now. No, my time working at a television station has forever ruined snow for me.</p>
<p>For now &quot;snow&quot; means scrambling to ensure that systems are working correctly, driving many miles in treacherous weather or, in tonight&#39;s case, being pent up in a hotel some blocks away from my place of employ instead of at home enjoying good food and watching Death Note with my brothers.</p>
<p>One day I will no longer work at a TV station and perhaps maybe the beauty and glory that is snow will return to me. I hope so, because on the off-chance I produce offspring, I don&#39;t want to pass on this miserly attitude I&#39;ve developed over the past year.</p>

Code: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/gis.zip">Download</a> ]
Demo: [ <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/gis/">Try it out</a> ]</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2012-05-31:</strong> I have updated the code to work with the latest source generated by Google Images, so it works again. Being that this is a scraper, I cannot make an guarantees that it will continue to operate correctly in the future. If you see any issues, let me know and I will do my best to patch accordingly.</p>
<p>Sometime ago, I found myself wanting to be able to programatically perform a Google image search (it was for album art on the music page). As Google does not provide an API for backend scripting, I wrote a quick scraper that does the job quite nicely. Hit the break for info on how to use this.[break]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">
include (&#39;gis.php&#39;);
$results = googleImageSearch(&#39;chobits&#39;);
print_r($results);
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#39;s the function prototype:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">
googleImageSearch($query, $page = 1, $size = GIS_ANY, $type = GIS_ANY);
</code></pre>
<p>This returns an array of stdObject with the following properties:
[list][item]<strong>resultLink</strong> - Link to Google image result. This is the page that displays when you click a result through normal image search[/item][item]<strong>source</strong> - URL of the source image[/item][item]<strong>title</strong> - Title associated with the image[/item][item]<strong>width</strong> - Width of the image[/item][item]<strong>height</strong> - Height of the image[/item][item]<strong>size</strong> - Size of the image[/item][item]<strong>type</strong> - Format of the image (jpg, png, etc)[/item][item]<strong>domain</strong> - Domain of source image[/item][item]<strong>thumb</strong> - stdObject with information on Google&#39;s thumbnail of the image. Properties are:[/item][item]<strong>thumb-&gt;src</strong> - URL to the thumbnail[/item][item]<strong>thumb-&gt;width</strong> - Width of the thumbnail[/item][item]<strong>thumb-&gt;height</strong> - Height of the thumbnail[/item][/list]</p>
<p>Size constants are (all fairly self-explanatory):
[list][item]GIS_LARGE[/item][item]GIS_MEDIUM[/item][item]GIS_SMALL[/item][/list]</p>
<p>And constants for type:
[list][item]GIS_FACE[/item][item]GIS_PHOTO[/item][item]GIS_CLIPART[/item][item]GIS_LINEART[/item][/list]</p>
<p>If you have any comments, questions or issues with this code, just leave a comment below and I&#39;ll do my best to help you!</p>

<p>Tetra: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/tetra.zip">Download</a> ]
Tetra 2: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/tetra2.zip">Download</a> ]</p>
<p>Picking up where I left off <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/make-it-open-ypngine">last time</a>, we shall progress forward with my CMS releases.</p>
<p>After realizing that the core model of YPNgine seemed broken (looking back it may not have been, but whatever), I decided to scrap the entire project and go a completely different route. When I began conceptualizing this new CMS, there were a few things that I needed to consider from the very start: security and extensibility. With that, I began working on Tetra (named after the type of fish I had at the time).[break]</p>
<p>My first goal of security as accomplished simply by writing my user and session modules first with various authentication checks made easily available. Also the idea of having the default &quot;guest&quot; user be an actual user in the database (user ID of 1) made a lot of things much simpler simpler.</p>
<p>Extensibility I accomplished by using an OOP model for what I called &quot;modules&quot; (things like message board, polls, documents, etc). Each module would require two functions that would be invoked by Tetra&#39;s core: TetraHandler and HandleRequest. TetraHandler would return various page or admin related items (page title, available navigation options, user settings forms, etc). HandleRequest did content rendering depending on the parameters passed to it which could be anything from a sidebar overview display to the main content.</p>
<p>Tetra was also completely themable, though in saying that so was YPNgine. However, whereas YPNgine used Smarty, Tetra was a solution of my own devise. I cringe to look at this code now because all of this string manipulation was written before I&#39;d learned of regular expressions, so it&#39;s bloated and slow. But it did work. In looking at the actual template syntax structure, it&#39;s apparent I borrowed a lot from XSL (especially in Tetra 2). Tying in with the themability, each theme could also have multiple styles which just controlled which stylesheets were being linked in.</p>
<p>There were two versions of Tetra, though the two are similar enough that I&#39;ve been covering them both here. The main differences between 1 and 2 was that 2 dumped all the Tetra core opbjects (database, templating, etc) into their own objects where the first was procedural style functions. Granted, these &quot;objects&quot; were static libs, but did provide some encapsulation none-the-less. Tetra 2 was also a near complete solution with an installer script, could install modules via an upload form in the CMS and had, when it worked, the ability for each user to customize the layout of the page to their liking.</p>
<p>I worked on Tetra from probably late 2003 to sometime in 2005 and was a huge part of life at that time. One of the very last things I developed for Tetra was the blog module, where this blog actually <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/my-real-blog">began</a>. Tetra is arguably the largest web anything I&#39;ve ever made both in terms of size and scope. All the source code seems to be very well commented, a habit I&#39;ve fallen out of, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made available the source code for both versions 1 and 2, the links for which can be found at the top of the page. Stay tuned as I release yet more web code, the next of which was quite unique.</p>
