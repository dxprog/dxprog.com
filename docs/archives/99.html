We&#39;ve just sat down and I&#39;ve paid my $5.96 for wireless internet (sucks). Our flight is scheduled to leave at 4:28 PM CDT and it is currently 2:23 PM CDT so we&#39;ve got a little bit of a wait. This flight will be taking us to Memphis, TN and then we&#39;ll have <em>another</em> two hour layover at which point I will probably be playing <strong>Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice For All</strong>. I&#39;ve already played through the first scenerio and it&#39;s freakin&#39; awesome. Kind of reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown">Encyclopedia Brown</a> (and how much I sucked at them). Seriously, though, it&#39;s a great game. I&#39;ll probably buy the first when I&#39;m done with this one.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#39;t have a plug-in here so battery life is at a premium. I may do a quick update when we get to Memphis, but I&#39;ll definitely do an update once in Orlando. Be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/sets/72157600180317876/">Flickr</a> album for pictorial updates. And, just a note, wireless internet FTW.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/silence-be-lifted">Silence be lifted!</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 3, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I&#39;ve been holding out on this news for quite some time now, but since everything seems to be falling into place like a well played game of Tetris I will let all the cats and their friends out of the preverbial bag.</p>
<p>First, and most importantly, I have finally gotten my GED. I will brag a little and post my scores:</p>
<p>Reading -  96%
Writing - 82%
Math - 99%
Science - 95%
Social Studies - 99%</p>
<p>Now those little percentages are how many people taking the GED in US are stupider than me, to put it not so nicely. Rather surprising, really, because I found the test to be incredibly simple. IMO, my essay did suck pretty bad. I was supposed to write about how I expected to be remembered which was kind of a lame topic to begin with. I am, usually, a fairly concise writer so coming up with 25 sentences on this topics was really, really hard. In the end I kind of wandered off topic talking about something else completely, but I had about 5 minutes to come up with an extra paragraph so I expanded on something I&#39;d touched on earlier. It sucked, trust me.</p>
<p>Since I have now hurdled hugh school the next logical step is college. Funny thing is that was lined up before my GED was. I have been accepted at Full Sail&#39;s school of awesomeness and will be taking the Digital Arts and Design degree. This means I will have to relocate myself to sunny Florida. Do I mind? Hell, no. Do my parents mind? I don&#39;t think so. Does everybody else mind even though it really isn&#39;t their business? Yes. I&#39;ve gotten more &quot;why would you move to Florida&quot; comments than I care to count. But, that aside, I&#39;m going to be attending the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; tour this weekend so I&#39;ll have plenty to blog about whilst I&#39;m there or when I get back. And don&#39;t worry, there&#39;ll be pictures and maybe some video.</p>
<p>Speaking of video, I&#39;m going to be making another faux commercial. I&#39;ve got the script ready, all I need to do is film, write some music, make some visuals, cut it all together in iMovie <strong>HD</strong> and put it up on YouTube.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, Chris got his electric guitar Monday and has been teaching himself to play (as have the rest of us). I will say this much: playing guitar is a bitch. I thought the piano was bad. At least it&#39;s pasture is much more spacous. Chris seems to be concentrating mostly on memorizing chords while I went and taught myself how to read tablatures and am trying to play stuff that&#39;s way out of my league (in my defense, however, I can play the first three notes of &quot;Sweet Child O Mine&quot;).</p>
<p>And, speaking of iMovie, I kind of moved away from OS X. I&#39;d been using it exclusively for quite some time and then Photoshop died. So I decided I&#39;d redownload it for Windows (I&#39;m a bastard that way) and I haven&#39;t really booted out of it since except to copy some files. I&#39;ve finally gotten more or less used to Vista. The interface, IMO, is more complicated now than it had been (especially the network dialogs). So I am, once again, a Windows man.</p>
<p>Well, I believe that shall tide the masses over at least until the weekend. Keep coming back as I will be blogging down in Florida (assuming our hotel has complimentary G, but it looks grim at this point). We shall see... we shall see...</p>

And he saw that it was good and clean and very Web 2.0 and he rested....</p>
<p>It&#39;s not using my new backend yet, but I figure this is pretty good anyways. I just need to get my htaccess file reinstated so the archives work.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/numbrs">Numbrs!</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 2, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Just remember, children, today&#39;s episode of Digg is brought to you by the numbers 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is absolutely insane. I missed everything until now because our router decided to die leaving me without internets. So, I&#39;ve got things kind of working now, I go to check digg and there&#39;s about two pages of front page stories containing, in some way shape or form, the following hexadecimal number: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. I guess Digg got a cease and desist from the good old MP of double A and they started pulling any stories with the following string of numbers and letters: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. Well, people got ticked off because 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 is their favorite copy/paste fodder so they inundated the place with 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 this and 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 that and that&#39;s where it stands now. Apperantly K. Rose and Co. are allowing 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 to be shown all over the place and say that if it kills Digg that&#39;s fine since they went down with a mutha-09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 fight. Personally, if Digg goes down due to this I may start pirating ALL my movies just to let them know how pissed off I am.</p>
<p>Thanks, have a nice 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 day.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&#39;s think for a second. Why would you have a single encryption key for EVERYTHING!? You people are stupid bastards. G&#39;Day. 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/flori-duh">Flori-duh!</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 28, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>No offense to the state, just a little thing Dave Berry is always pointing out (you can&#39;t spell Florida without the &quot;duh&quot;). If I haven&#39;t mentioned the fact that Dave Berry is one of the funniest columnists alive, I will do so now and tell you to go out and get some of his books. The Guide to Guys and Money Secrets are my personal favorites. But, this all really has nothing to do with this blog post so I will move along.</p>
<p>I guess the first thing I want to say is that Guitar Hero II is pretty much the best guitar-based game ever created. I kind of sat on the edge about it for a while because the song list seemed kind of meh compared to it&#39;s predecessor, but I decided to give it a chance and GameFly&#39;d it. I was unimpressed for a while and then I hit the boss song. Freebird. All 9 and a half glorious minutes of it. Needless to say I went out and just bought the game the next day and now I rock out on it all the time. Maybe I&#39;ll post a video sometime. Oh, and a sidenote, this whole Guitar Hero madness made Chris buy an electric guitar so maybe one of us&#39;ll be the next Van Halen or we can form a band and resurrect the glory days of the 80s. Maybe...</p>
<p>I&#39;m back to my old self again and have created a new design for the site. With everybody going &quot;Web 2.0&quot; I figured I&#39;d better jump on the bandwagon and stay current. However, in my defense, the original Tetra design used rounded tables before rounded tables were the thing to do, so I&#39;m a trailblazer there. I&#39;m going to wait to implement the new design until I&#39;ve gotten a new backend written. Wordpress is nice and all, but all the spam (which you lucky souls never see) is really driving me insane. Besides, I can make a less bloated piece of software to suit my needs. When it comes to web stuff I usually trust my own work over that of others. Maybe I&#39;m an egotistical jerk that way :-P.</p>
<p>Shifting to my public life, things at work ar fairly normal. However, I did drop the CSM charade and joined Robin Hood&#39;s Merry Men, or as everybody else knows us, cart pushers. You&#39;re probably thinking &quot;Wow! Why did you take that kind of a pay cut just to push carts, a lowly job made for the slime of the Earth?&quot;. Firstly, I wasn&#39;t actually being paid CSM wages, so I lost a whole .40 an hour. Secondly, that .40 an hour has bought me some sanity and hapiness. The lot is a nice, quiet place to be. The carts don&#39;t complain about their credit card being denied, or that something rang up the wrong price, or.... you get the picture. I don&#39;t know about people in other towns, but Bartians seem to be a whiny bunch (I&#39;ll admit I can be whiny as well).</p>
<p>Well, that about wraps it up for this blog post. Tune in next Friday as maybe I&#39;ll make this a weekly thing. It would do me some good to get into some sort of schedule of doing things.</p>
