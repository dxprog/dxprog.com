Despite the fact that Windows is easily installed thanks to the magic of Boot Camp, I've been working in OS X mostly. I feel I've been using it long enough to give my opinion:

**Pros**
- Easy to use. Once I figured out the basics I pretty much got it.
- Stability (for the most part). A few minutes ago Safari died an ugly death on me dragging the rest of the system down with it and I've been in a must reboot situation twice (not including the system updates)
- Pretty looking. Hey, what can I say? I'm a sucker for the genie effect.

**Cons**
- Apple's interface guidlines tend to make apps overly simplistic. Toolbars are almost non-existant, everything seems to revolve around a drag and drop interface. This is an area where Windows apps can really shine given a developer who knows what they are doing.
- Keyboard craziness. I don't know about you, but I use the Home and End keys to navigate through text boxes all the time. Albiet, it's still there (Cmd-Left and Right respectively), but pressing two keys (or three if I want to make a selection) is a lot harder. Also, they seemed to ignore the delete key as well.

<p>In my opinion, the best artwork I&#39;ve done to date. Not necessarily the best joke ever, but it was good enough to hit the Joystiq poll so I call it even.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. I did a Michael Jackson joke. Please forgive me.</p>
