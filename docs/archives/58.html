My first task: create the site wide search. Now, bear in mind that this was my first time really doing anything in PHP and search is quite a big thing. Ask Google. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d back me up.</p>
<p>Today, some eight years later, I have implemented site search into my website. Of course, it&#39;s running circles around my original code in terms of complexity, speed and even the amount of lines it&#39;s implemented in (340 v 70).</p>
<p>Here are some of the fun things the new search can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searches through all content types and each type can display differently in search results</li>
<li>All searches are weighted against where the terms were matched. The algorithm is such: (matches in title <em> 10) + (matched tags </em> 5) + matches in body</li>
<li>As with all aspects of my site, the search has a RESTful interface so I could make an ajaxy instant search if I so desired</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some good queries to show off what it can do:</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.com/search/rock%20band/">Rock Band</a> - Example where weighting really helps
<a href="http://dxprog.com/search/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> - Example of different document types</p>
<p>btw, if you wanted to see the old partyfish search code, <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/search.txt">here you go.</a> The new search stuff will be added to the repository shortly and I&#39;ll be making that public very soon.</p>

Sadly, my bros are now college students and, given the have homework and what have you, you&#39;re left with mostly just my reviews. But, there it is.</p>
<h2 id="angel-beats">Angel Beats</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_angel_beats.jpg" alt="" title="Angel Beats">
Angel Beats is a venture from many of the staff of Key, creators of Kanon, Air and Clannad. It follows the souls of a group of high school students who have died and are trapped in a sort of limbo, trying to find peace with their previous lives.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - I&#39;m a sucker for all things Key, so it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed Angel Beats. It has a good cast of characters and an interesting premise, with moments that can swing from plain ridiculous - any episode where they go to the Guild - to absolutely depressing - Yuri&#39;s back story comes to mind. The animation is top notch and the show has it&#39;s fair share of good songs, too (my favorite would be the closer, Brave Song). I look forward to an NA release. - <strong>8/10</strong>

<p>I don&#39;t think this one came out quite as well. Stupid arms and poses and stuff.</p>

It&#39;s a little shorter today as we were all down with the sickness at various points last week, but rest assured more is to come.</p>
<h2 id="dai-mahou-touge-magical-witch-punie-chan-">Dai Mahou Touge (Magical Witch Punie-chan)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_punie.jpg" alt="" title="Dai Mahou Togue">
The story revolves around a young girl named Tanaka Punie who is princess of Magical Land. In order for her to become queen, however, she must become a transfer student in a Japanese high school. Crazy hi-jinks ensue.</p>

Unfortunately, while this show has plenty of crazy moments, nothing ever really lived up to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4i-F0gwwzs&amp;feature=related">clip that inspired me to watch it.</a> The show itself is a successor of sorts to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">Bokusatsu Tenshi</a>, but never comes close in terms of production or entertainment value. It feels like it&#39;s trying to do the same type of thing, but just doesn&#39;t have the good writing and characters that Bokusatsu Tenshi does. - <strong>5/10</strong></p>

I have even less to say about this. <strong>7/10</strong></p>

Wow, this show is weird.  It shows an anthropomorphic potato peeling itself, which is a testament to just how weird it is.  Unfortunately, this weirdness isn&#39;t enough to make the four episode series very funny.
The first episode is great, maintaining its comic energy throughout, but once the second episode comes around it&#39;s already losing momentum.  That&#39;s not to say that the final three episodes are bad, because they do contain some genuinely funny moments, but between those moments of win it rarely becomes more than mild entertainment.
For a short series though, you could do worse. <strong>6/10</strong></p>

The Chinese zodiac says that this year is the year of the rabbit. Finally, reason for me to stuff a picture of Haruhi and cast sporting bunny outfits at the top of a post. But, this isn&#39;t what I&#39;m here to discuss.</p>
<p>It is indeed a new year and with new years come waves and waves of resolutions. In years prior, I openly shunned the idea of making new years resolutions. Why wait for some celestial anomoly to make changes to yourself as a person? While I still hold to this belief, I now view the changing of the calendar as a time to reflect upon/mark milestones within one&#39;s life. That said, here is my list of things I would like to accomplish in 2011.
