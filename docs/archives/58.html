Some of these had some pretty cool concepts behind them but, for whatever reason, I never completed them. So, in a series of blog posts shamelessly ripping a line of dialog from Altered Beast, I will present to you some of the cooler of these projects - complete with all their original source code. Today&#39;s highlight is Chainploder.[break]</p>
<p>Chainploder is, in its essence, a blatent rip off of some game I saw on digg and then again on Facebook. This game consisted of a playing field full of bouncing circles and you had to clear a certain amount of them by starting a chain reaction from a single point. I figured this would be a pretty simple thing to code, so I got on Skype and spun up another coding challenge with my bro  (as I am wont to do). I don&#39;t recall all the details, but I don&#39;t think I spent much more than an hour working on this.</p>
<p>[flash=<a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.swf]">http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.swf]</a></p>
<p>As you can see, my weapon of choice was Flash (I was into that at the time). You may also notice that the game buggy and crappy. Granted, it&#39;s not terrible for 162 lines of code.</p>
<p>So, there is my first highlight. This is probably the most recent project of the things I will showcase later, and probably one of the only ones that won&#39;t be Visual Basic. But, I believe it&#39;s a good kick off.</p>
<p>Oh, you can get the source here: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.fla">Download</a> (Flash CS4)</p>

This must be discreetly understood or no good will come of the story I am about to regale. Every <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-coding-compo/">once and again</a>, we&#39;ll embark on a coding competition. Last time was a game, this time a chat client. My weapon of choice was various web languages (PHP and JS for the programatic stuff) and his was C++. Arguably, I had an advantage.</p>
<p>Even though I was able to bypass the whole sockets layer, I did set a rule for myself: I could not resort to using a transactional database (i.e. MySQL). Granted, I didn&#39;t foresee any issues as I had the power of APC caching on my side. It turned out that this would be what I fought with most and, eventually, just give up on.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, despite the fact that apc_store was returning success on caching an object, it would not persist. A quick call to apc_exists immediately after the store command with the same cache key confirmed this. I went round and round with this issue. Sometimes the object would persist for one or two sessions but ultimately would up be dropped. I read somewhere that storing an array of objects could cause issues (which I was doing), so I serialized the bitch before caching. No dice.</p>
<p>In the end I said &quot;screw it&quot; and just created my own disk-based caching model. I decided to take the whole thing a little further and account for cache collisions (two instances accessing the cache at the same time) which may or may not work. The only reason I even bothered was because I have an ID variable that needs to iterate for every single chat posted and sought to avoid two scripts running simultaneously and writing an erroneous value (a point that was raised in some fashion during my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">Digg interview</a>.</p>
<p>So, two hours after the initial one we&#39;d allotted for the competition, I wound up victorious. While not glamorous, my chat client does indeed work: <a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/quickChat">Live Demo</a> - <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/quickChat.zip">Source</a></p>
<p>What of my brother&#39;s program? Well, let&#39;s just say the computers weren&#39;t talking too nice and the program kept crashing.</p>
<p>Victory is mine!</p>

While I was doing this, I  recalled some of my first web related programming projects, most notably YPNgine. Considering it was my first major PHP outing, I pulled off quite a feat. Writing a message board is no small task. However, there was one part in particular that I was mulling over: the censor. </p>
<p>If you happen to be a former YPNer, you may recall seeing many references to &quot;bottomembly&quot;. Carrying over the censor find/replace list that had been used on phpBB before it, all instances of the character sequence &quot;ass&quot; were summarily replaced with &quot;bottom&quot;. Now I am being very choosy when I say &quot;character sequence&quot; and not &quot;word&quot; as the censor couldn&#39;t differentiate words.</p>
<p>This oversight was brought to my attention my young programmer self struggled to figure out a solution. Here&#39;s what I wound up doing:</p>
<p>[code=php]// Copyright (c) 2003 Matt Hackmann
// Full copyright info in index.php</p>
<p>function censor_post ($body)
{</p>
<pre><code>$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bannedwords&quot;;
$result = db_Query ($query);

$body = &quot; &quot;.$body;

$body = str_ireplace (&quot;assembly&quot;, &quot;ytrewq&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;assum&quot;, &quot;asd;ljf&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;glass&quot;, &quot;glss&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hllo&quot;, $body);

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; db_num_Rows ($result); $i++) {
    $row = db_fetch_array ($result);
    $body = str_ireplace ($row[&quot;blocked_word&quot;], &quot;&quot;, $body);
}

if ($body == &quot; &quot;)
    $body = &quot;Censored&quot;;

$body = str_replace (&quot;asd;ljf&quot;, &quot;assum&quot;, $body);
$body = str_replace (&quot;ytrewq&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;, $body);
$body = str_replace (&quot;glss&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;hllo&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, $body);

return $body;
</code></pre><p>}[/code]</p>
<p>As you can see, I started hard coding in a list of safe words, replacing those instances with a random (or not so random) string of characters, run the censor and then convert those strings back to the safe words. This was a list I kept expanding on as they were found during normal conversation on the forum. I giggle as I look at this list and think of what the censor was doing to those words: bottomume, glbottom and hecko.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just something that I, eight years later, have to look back on and chuckle about.</p>
