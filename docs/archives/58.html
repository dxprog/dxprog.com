My mom tipped me off some years ago that one can curb these offers by using their own self-addressed stamped envelopes against them to have oneself removed from their mailing list.</p>
<p>Using the power of a form letter, I&#39;ve done this with great success over the years. However, I&#39;ve been getting a little more personal and creative lately, putting my box of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/crayola-commercial/">Rejection Crayons</a> to good use. These are the latest in my wave of &quot;stop the spam&quot; mail campaign.</p>

<p>If you were unfortunate enough to have sat through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-top-5-list/">top 5 anime video</a>, you&#39;ll know that Clannad was pretty high up there on the list (number one, to be exact). To this day, I still consider it my favorite anime so when I wandered past a &quot;Clannad - Motion Picture&quot; DVD at Hastings, I had to rent it even though I knew it was going to be terrible.</p>
<p>I had no idea just how bad it was going to be. Ah, where to begin?

I&#39;m currently suffering from what I can best describe as culture shock. A good many things are polar opposite from how they were at Griffin. There&#39;s no phones ringing all the time, no boss interrupting every ten minutes and also it is very, very quiet. Like, I haven&#39;t really spoken to anybody all week and it seems (from where I sit) that there are no other impromptu coworker conversations breaking out. That part I kind of miss, but the quiet certainly does lend well to productivity.</p>
<p>I cannot say, however, that I still don&#39;t find the calm a little unnerving. Seeing how I&#39;ve lived in a house with a lot of people for nearly my entire life, I&#39;ve grown accustomed to the noise that comes with it. So much so, it seems, that whereas most people would notice the abundance of noise, I am keenly aware of its absence. But it&#39;s something I&#39;d best get used to because I&#39;ll be endeavoring out on my own in just a couple of short months.</p>
<p>Yes, my own place. Something I&#39;ve daydreamed about for quite some time (and still am doing as the time draws near). Thinking about how I&#39;ll arrange things, what kind of furniture and wall adornments I&#39;d like, extra-house activities I can take part in, etc. It&#39;s certainly an exciting time, but also one that carries a bit of somber weight. Certainly, I&#39;ve done this &quot;moving away from home&quot; thing before, but last time came with a fair certainty that I would be returning for some time. This time is it. The true closing of this chapter of my life and the opening of a new one with all the experiences that will come with. Like hitting the dating scene. That will certainly bring both some interesting, awesome and probably incredibly awkward moments.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different.</p>
<p>As you may or may not be aware (which would be sad if you weren&#39;t), Japan got hit by a big ol&#39; quake yesterday. Now, usually I don&#39;t really &quot;feel&quot; much when these natural disasters strike. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m cold and heartless (or maybe I am), but things Katrina, Sri Lanka  or Haiti really only elicited an &quot;oh, well that kinda sucks&quot; feeling from me. I believe this probably stems from the fact that I have no real connection to any of these places or people (Louisiana even). But, through all the games, manga and anime I&#39;ve consumed over the last few years, I&#39;ve developed a deep respect for Japan, its people and its culture and I think that is why this disaster has touched me more than the others. That all said, my thoughts will be with these fine people as they pull themselves back together. I&#39;ve no qualm in my mind that they will do so admirably.</p>

I will be moving on to bigger and better things at Winnercomm, doing web work for the Outdoor Channel it seems. At least it comes with a significant raise and the title of &quot;web developer.&quot;</p>
<p>To commemorate the event, I thought I&#39;d do a small photo montage to my old job as captured by my iPhone&#39;s camera.

<p>A little something something I made for achieving 5000 page views on my illustrious <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt profile</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this is probably one of my better ventures, though my brother says my art style is &quot;lumpy&quot;. I cannot disagree. And hands? They&#39;re such a pain in the ass to draw. Like I was saying on the way into bowling last night, drawing would be so much easier if we had no hands and arms/legs were simple rectangles. Yes, it would make awesome things like eating and playing Tetris Attach much more difficult, but people would be easier to draw.</p>
<p>Wait... with no hands I couldn&#39;t draw...</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
