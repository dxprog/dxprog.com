<p>I only post it early because I&#39;ve got to go to work soon. This is sort of my answer to <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060520/">this</a> and <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060602/">this</a>. I was supposed to hold up my end of the switcheroo, but I didn&#39;t really like the comic I made up so, meh :-P</p>

<p>Aside from the outcome, this comic is absolultely, 100% true right down to the thought process going on in my head. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve zoned out on what I was doing to focus on whatever programming problem faced me at the time, but it&#39;s pretty sad.</p>
