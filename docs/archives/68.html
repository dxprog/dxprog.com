This whole Facebook debacle has nary phased me as the whole point I post things on there is for selfless promotion and narcissistic reasons. I want people to read those things. But, there are a couple things I hand out to only an elite few people: my phone number and the privilege of Skyping me. This latter one is especially fun for me.</p>
<p>Sometimes during conversations, something interesting will be said that sets me off on a journey to Photoshop to concoct a visual representation of said mutterings. The fruits of these labors are interesting indeed and I present them here for your enjoyment.</p>

But, hey. Nothing terribly exciting has happened, so there it is.</p>
<p>I decided that last week would be a pretty good week to blow a whole bunch of my paid vacation time... after all, the best day of the year happened to fall in that week (hint: my birthday). It was nice to just forget about the world around me and piddle around quietly the way I used to back in the days when I was <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/pretty-pictures-abound/">without work.</a> I churned out no less than three distinct (but wholly unfinished) projects.</p>
<p>The first of these is a UX re-imagining for my ongoing project, the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. Now that I am a far better JavaScript guru than I was when this was originally written, I&#39;ve decided to take a completely different approach in terms of user presentation (though, the underlying functionality is pretty much the same).</p>
<p>Another thing I did was start in on learning some more HTML5 canvas stuffs, as it provides a pretty sweet opportunity for gaming purposes. I started messing around with coding a simple <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/gameEngine/">drawing framework</a> and, at the behest of my <a href="http://square-headed.com/entry/announcing-the-official-launch-of-3dview/">osu! fanatical brother</a>, began attempting a <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/eba_html5/">clone of sorts for that</a>. Ultimately, I made some good progress and the canvas object is certainly a powerful tool, but there are some simple things that it simply can&#39;t do that keeps Flash at the advantage (I&#39;m looking at you, per blit alpha).</p>
<p>Other than these few programming things and a goodly amount of time with my nose in books, it was a slothful week to be sure. But, then again, that&#39;s the whole point of &quot;vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>Tune in this weekend as I head to yet another anime con.</p>

Then I stopped. Not sure why, but here are some of the fruits of that (and other) endeavors.</p>
<p>[gallery=May 2009 Art]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Maya_and_Kay.JPG" alt="" title="Maya Fey and Kay Faraday.

I drew portraits of all five main characters over the aforementioned week, but Yui and Azusa are the only one&#39;s I&#39;ve colored thus far as they were arguably the best sketched.

<p>There you have it. Enjoy!</p>

Currently my graph is telling me that I had a pretty crappy week last week, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re here to discuss.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bartlesvilleparks.com/Pages/pathfinder1.html">Pathfinder Parkway</a> has been my preferred walking path of choice for the weekends as it removes me from all the loud roads and reminds me of the lengthy walks I took to the bank in Winter Park via the <a href="http://www.dep.state.fl.us/gwt/guide/regions/eastcentral/trails/cadyway.htm">Cady Way Trail</a>. The Pathfinder runs right along the Caney River, Bartlesville&#39;s local body of poisoned water, but it does provide that &quot;nature&quot; feel. But, I could throw words at you all day and not get the point across, so queue up the photo gallery!</p>
<p>[gallery=Pathfinder Parkway]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_path.jpg" alt="" title="A shot of the path itself, all shrouded in foresty glory"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_bridge.jpg" alt="" title="The footbridge that crosses the Caney. Its iron/wood construction gives it a rustic quaint feel, I think, and adds to the experience of walking the trail"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_pump.jpg" alt="" title="An old abandoned oil pump. This is just one of many, but hey, it&#39;s Oklahoma so it&#39;s to be expected, right? I&#39;ll admit, though, it&#39;s kind of eerie walking right up alongside these things out in the middle of nowhere with their ominous whir and the wonderful stench of unearthed oil."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_tanks.jpg" alt="" title="Of course, where there are oil pumps, there will be storage tanks. But, damn, are they dilapidated."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_car.jpg" alt="" title="Wait...? What? A car? How the hell did they get that thing out in the middle of a forest? Obviously drunk, otherwise they&#39;d have not careened off the cliff."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_mixer.jpg" alt="" title="Okay? Seriously? An abandoned cement mixer? Aren&#39;t there scrap heaps or something where these things can be dumped?"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_traction_engine.jpg" alt="" title="HOLY SHIT! It&#39;s Terrance from Thomas the Tank Engine! OMG OMG OM.... WTF?!!">[/gallery]</p>
<p>Okay, so it has it&#39;s downsides. Arguably the most annoying part is the dozen or so oil pumps, but it&#39;s amazing the crap I&#39;ve spotted along this trail. I will, perhaps, update again with more pictures later as these just barely scratch the surface.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/more-billboard-fun">More Billboard Fun</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 3, 2010</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/monopoly_billboard.jpg" alt="" title="Hell - A tiny ass hole in the ground"></p>
<p>I was on another one of my afternoon walks, shooting to get in my 10,000 steps for the day, when I ran into yet another billboard that struck me an odd way. As can be seen above, it depicts Mr. Monopoly jumping out of Hell, presumably after having used his &quot;Get Out of Hell Free&quot; card. Their illegal use of the Hasbro icon notwithstanding, this brings up some interesting notions.</p>
<p>The sign insinuates that you&#39;ve already BEEN to Hell (you can&#39;t get out of something you&#39;re not in). This means that you are some sort of terrible person, probably a child molester or some one who talks at the theater. This notion of leaving Hell kind of makes &quot;eternal punishment&quot; seem a little less eternal. But, let&#39;s play by their rules and assume for a bit that Hell is indeed an escapable place so we can extrapolate further.</p>
<p>Anybody who is mildly familiar with Monopoly knows that when you land in jail there are three ways of getting out: get our of jail free card, roll doubles, or pay $50. Applying these rules to our great Hell-break scheme - as these seem to be the rules we&#39;re playing by - there are now <em>other</em> ways with which to escape eternal damnation. If you&#39;ve got some extra cash, just be sure to be buried with some tenners or, if you&#39;re not, play it like a game of chance, bring some dice and pray to God that you get doubles (remember, you get three throws). Suddenly, your chances of escaping Hell are looking pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Now that we have traversed the psychology cleverly hidden in this image, we can finally extract it&#39;s true message: Hell is for poor people.</p>
