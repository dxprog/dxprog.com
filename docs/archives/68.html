Today I focus mainly on shounen/action genres.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-ball-z">Dragon Ball Z</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_dragon_ball_z.jpg" alt="" title="Dragon Ball Z">
Without <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> the American anime market may very well not exist (certainly not the way it does today). <em>DBZ</em> is certainly an entertaining show, what with all the rediculous battles and &quot;power up&quot; sequences, but it&#39;s not without its faults. Cheesy and reptitive animation dampen the action sequences and there really isn&#39;t a whole lot of character development. In fact, I consider <em>DBZ</em> to be almost like a &quot;bro show&quot;. And, toss on the fact that no character can ever really die and a lot of the suspense has just been killed. But, at that, it does make for some excellent entertainment if you&#39;re willing to overlook the formulaic plots and the aforementioned other problems. <strong>6/10</strong>

I&#39;m thinking perhaps that an art section on the gallery page might be a good idea, but in the mean time you can enjoy it right here or on my <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt page</a>. But, I digress.

I suppose this could be considered bordering on yuri, in face my brother Jeff walked in as I was drawing and said &quot;That&#39;s not platonic...&quot;. It is, of course, and who should know better than the artist? Subject matter aside, I consider this a large step up in terms of coloring and shading for me, trying out some new things."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nagisa_Winter.jpg" alt="" title="Nagisa again, this time from the After Story part of CLANNAD. I have to admit that I cheated a little on this one: I didn&#39;t sketch the line art myself. I instead traced a screen grab and did all the coloring (I wanted this as a desktop wallpaper). It actually was quite the learning experience as I&#39;d not done coloring of this caliber before and I got a lot of things figured out. I hope to begin using these techniques for my own art in the near future.">[/gallery]
I hope everybody had a Merry Christmas and will have an awesome New Year!</p>

Yes, I know I said two in the previous post, but after creating the list I realized it would be more prudent to split this into three. This also allows me to kind of categorize things and I&#39;ll kick the list off with cute and romantic comedies. Another thing to note is that my criteria have changed. The movies and video games were all things <em>released</em> in 2008-2009. These are all things I <em>watched</em> in those years. So, without further ado, here is part one of my anime reviews.</p>
<h2 id="midori-days">Midori Days</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_midori_days.jpg" alt="" title="Midori Days">
<em>Midori Days</em> falls into the latter of the aforementioned categories. The premise is absolutely rediculous opening with protagonist Sawamura Seiji waking up one day to find that a tiny girl, Kasugano Midori, has replaced his right hand. Oddly enough, even though the show indulges in more fan service than any other I&#39;ve watched, there was never a raunchy moment, something I thought odd considering the premise. The overall story follows these two as Midori tries to win over Seiji who is otherwise distracted by just about every other woman within eyesight... except the ones that actually like him. The show is full of plenty of laughs and feel good moments and I&#39;d certainly recommend watching it if you are interested in the genre. <strong>7/10</strong>

<h2 id="star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2008-xbox-360-">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008, Xbox 360)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_force_unleashed.jpg" alt="" title="Star Wars: The Force Unleashed">
There was quite a bit of hype surrounding this game when it came out. It was supposed to be a Star Wars IP that the world hadn&#39;t seen since <em>Shadows of the Empire</em>. Did it live up to the hype? Depends on who you ask. I didn&#39;t buy it until recently, but I definitely had fun playing it. That said, there were also many points where I was frustrated out of my mind to the point of controller throwing (something I&#39;ve not done in years). Some of this was due to faulty game mechanics, but mostly my own incompetence. Sadly, the game is fairly repetitive in terms of combat and I found myself relying on Force lightning to handily finish off every enemy I came across. There are plenty of options for combat such as push and choke and, of course, your lightsaber, but none of these were as handy or wholly satisfying as lightning. Oh, and for all the hype about Euphoria, never once did I see a stormtrooper <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/2/1/">grab another in mid air</a>. <strong>7/10</strong>
