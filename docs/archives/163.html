So I decided to do Midna today. There are parts of this picture I kind of like but overall I really hate it. First off she looks like a guy. Second her head is not wide enough and I scrwed up the shading on the face so it's hard to make out her eye. The body I'm happier with than what it originally was, but it still seems... off. Ugh. Maybe whatever I draw tomorrow will be better.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/its-zelda-fanart-week">It&#x27;s Zelda Fanart Week!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 17, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content">I need to do more drawing to help beef up my skills.

Honestly, I'm not terribly thrilled with this. All I can say is I can't wait to get my Mac Book Pro from the school loaded with Photoshop so I can use tools I'm already familiar with. My Prismas are nice, but they lack an undo function.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/its-zelda-fanart-week">It&#x27;s Zelda Fanart Week!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 17, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I need to do more drawing to help beef up my skills.

Some kid and a frog off the cover of a book my little brothers and sisters got from the library. I was originally just going to draw the kid (which I only drew because that&#39;s what was in front of my face), but the crowd that had gathered around me started chanting for the frog. So I drew the frog. Whatever.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for some more awesome stuff. Awesome stuff that isn&#39;t wierd kids and flying frogs.</p>
