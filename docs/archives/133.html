YAY! No, seriously, it&#39;s only coming to DVD ;-)</p>
<p>May 6th, as I predicted, I will be back at the old register again. Thank goodness :-P. My sleep &quot;schedule&quot; as of late has been so screwed it&#39;s not funny. Also, I have yet to take the driving test. Tuesday and Wednesday I slept right through 7am and Thursday I spent my entire 15 minute break trying to ge through, to no avail :-P. So I&#39;m going to try again this week and hopefully I&#39;ll luck out.</p>
<p>Speaking of circles, my interests seem to be changing again. The last time this happened was in 1997 when I was introduced to computers. Now I seem to be getting back to my roots in art... with computers of course ;-). The whole comic thing sparked my intrest again and I&#39;m left wondering why I quit in the first place. I take that back, I quit because a) I couldn&#39;t get my frackin&#39; pencil drawings to look like the book, b) I thought there was no money in it. I&#39;ve figured both things out: pencil drawings suck, and I can make a killing as a graphics artist. I spent most of this afternoon redesigning my character in my comic and this is what I came up with:</p>

<p>As you can see the hair is more normal now, the glasses shrank and I&#39;ve switched to a harder shading style (the airbrush thing was just a pain in the butt). All this arty stuff has made me realize one thing: painting with a mouse is murder. That said, this coming pay check I&#39;m going to invest in a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16883100021">graphics tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve rambled on long enough. I probably need to be getting to bed here soon as there&#39;s another early day tomorrow :-P.</p>

Work the last few days hasn&#39;t been nearly as bad as it had been, but still icky all the same. This morning was rather interesting, however. The district manager came to pay a visit today and the place was abuzz making sure everything was neat, organized, etc. It&#39;s kind of like what most college kids do when their parents come over: let things slide till the man shows up.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I e-mailed my supervisor yesterday (yeah, I&#39;ve got corporate e-mail. &#39;Tis cool) and asked him exactly when I&#39;d be going back to cashiering, and, thank heavens, he said probably between the first and fifth of May. I&#39;d personally figured on the sixth since it begins a new work week, but the earlier the better :-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be getting up early tomorrow and try to get my appointment in for the driving test again. Hopefully I&#39;ll be luckier than I was last week. If that fails I&#39;ll try again on Wednesday. I&#39;m really itching to get the thing because then I work on getting my spice orange Chevy Aveo:</p>

<p>&#39;Tis sweet, no?</p>
<p>I bought the new DS &quot;game&quot; Brain Age the other day and I have got to say it is one of the sweetest things I&#39;ve played in some time. My current brain age is 28, 20 being the ideal, down from 55 a couple days ago currently beating everybody else who&#39;s got a profile on my card (Mom, Jeff, and Chris). I&#39;ve also discovered Sudoku. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve scoffed at it all this time because it&#39;s very similiar to MasterMind in terms of solving it. However, I still like MasterMind. IT RAWKS!!</p>

<p>Alright, it&#39;s way early but I&#39;ve been working really hard on it the last couple days and I wasn&#39;t about to wait several more just to post it :-P. Anyhoo, I hope you enjoy (and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll enjoy the interesting stream of comments this&#39;ll generate....)</p>
