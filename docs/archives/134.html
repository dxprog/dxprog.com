<p>Once upon a time, I used to enjoy the snow. My brothers and I would make giant snow forts using spare laundry detergent buckets and then spend the next several days pummeling these impenetrable <em>fortrii</em> with the meanest snowballs we could conjure up. Snow was indeed a wondrous thing, but not so much now. No, my time working at a television station has forever ruined snow for me.</p>
<p>For now &quot;snow&quot; means scrambling to ensure that systems are working correctly, driving many miles in treacherous weather or, in tonight&#39;s case, being pent up in a hotel some blocks away from my place of employ instead of at home enjoying good food and watching Death Note with my brothers.</p>
<p>One day I will no longer work at a TV station and perhaps maybe the beauty and glory that is snow will return to me. I hope so, because on the off-chance I produce offspring, I don&#39;t want to pass on this miserly attitude I&#39;ve developed over the past year.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>PHP Google Image Search Library</h2><time>January 29, 2011</time><div><p>Github Repository: <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/PHPGIS">Fork It!</a>
Code: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/gis.zip">Download</a> ]
Demo: [ <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/gis/">Try it out</a> ]</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2012-05-31:</strong> I have updated the code to work with the latest source generated by Google Images, so it works again. Being that this is a scraper, I cannot make an guarantees that it will continue to operate correctly in the future. If you see any issues, let me know and I will do my best to patch accordingly.</p>
<p>Sometime ago, I found myself wanting to be able to programatically perform a Google image search (it was for album art on the music page). As Google does not provide an API for backend scripting, I wrote a quick scraper that does the job quite nicely. Hit the break for info on how to use this.[break]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">
include (&#39;gis.php&#39;);
$results = googleImageSearch(&#39;chobits&#39;);
print_r($results);
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#39;s the function prototype:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">
googleImageSearch($query, $page = 1, $size = GIS_ANY, $type = GIS_ANY);
</code></pre>
<p>This returns an array of stdObject with the following properties:
[list][item]<strong>resultLink</strong> - Link to Google image result. This is the page that displays when you click a result through normal image search[/item][item]<strong>source</strong> - URL of the source image[/item][item]<strong>title</strong> - Title associated with the image[/item][item]<strong>width</strong> - Width of the image[/item][item]<strong>height</strong> - Height of the image[/item][item]<strong>size</strong> - Size of the image[/item][item]<strong>type</strong> - Format of the image (jpg, png, etc)[/item][item]<strong>domain</strong> - Domain of source image[/item][item]<strong>thumb</strong> - stdObject with information on Google&#39;s thumbnail of the image. Properties are:[/item][item]<strong>thumb-&gt;src</strong> - URL to the thumbnail[/item][item]<strong>thumb-&gt;width</strong> - Width of the thumbnail[/item][item]<strong>thumb-&gt;height</strong> - Height of the thumbnail[/item][/list]</p>
<p>Size constants are (all fairly self-explanatory):
[list][item]GIS_LARGE[/item][item]GIS_MEDIUM[/item][item]GIS_SMALL[/item][/list]</p>
<p>And constants for type:
[list][item]GIS_FACE[/item][item]GIS_PHOTO[/item][item]GIS_CLIPART[/item][item]GIS_LINEART[/item][/list]</p>
