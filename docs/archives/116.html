But, whatever.</p>

<p>Some time ago, a coworker passed along a link to this very nifty <a href="http://thecolourclock.co.uk/">Colour Clock</a> which displays the time and uses the values of said time to drive the background color. It&#39;s really quite pretty and nifty. Back when he linked me, there was the flash version on the site and a download for an OS X screen saver. No Windows love.</p>
<p>So, I fired up my copy of Visual Studio and set about correcting this sadness. I never really polished it to the extent I wanted, which is why I&#39;m putting it up as a source code release. There is a binary in there, but no installer or anything.</p>
<p>Also, before I created this version, I also conjured up a JavaScript one as well, which you can see <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/color_clock.html">here</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Procrastinatorium</h2><time>June 19, 2011</time><div><p>Some time ago I put up my list of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done">New Year&#39;s</a> resolutions. On the whole, I&#39;m not doing terrible. I&#39;m exercising more, I&#39;ve gotten an apartment and I promptly gave up in Final Fantasy X-2, a decision we all agree is better for my sanity. On the art front, however, things are less than stellar; I can probably count on two hands the amount of times I&#39;ve set pencil to paper to do anything. I blame it all on this one piece I&#39;ve bee &quot;working on&quot; since February.</p>
<p>After I completed that <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/dddoll-beam/">one commission</a>, I got another one similar only it involved multiple characters from a source I&#39;m not familiar with. But, in the spirit of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ganbare"><em>ganbare</em></a>, I gave it a shot. And now, four months later, it&#39;s stuck in development hell somewhere between the coloring and shading phase:</p>

<p>These are the first and last of what is supposed to be four panels. I like the last one there, not so keen on the first and am less so of the one&#39;s in between (which is why they&#39;ve not been colored yet.</p>
<p>All this said, I hereby change my New Year&#39;s resolution of draw more to &quot;finish this goddamn piece before the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Even I am unsure of whether I can keep it...</p>
