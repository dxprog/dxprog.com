<p>It&#39;s been quite some time. About a month and a half, apparently. Now that I&#39;m slowly easing into life in <em>Cali</em>, it&#39;s time for the Accountability Report to return. Posts about me living here, the process of getting here, and the LinkedIn story will come at some time.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - There are certainly some interesting developments here. On the food front, I&#39;m eating probably the largest variety of food I ever have thanks to the company provided lunches. My vegetable consumption is definitely through the roof. I&#39;m staying hydrated with water, green tea, and fruit juices thanks again to the good folks who employ me. The downside is, they also provide unlimited free sugary snacks such as peanut M&amp;Ms and yogurt pretzels. I am weak to these items and have caved on a few occasions. My plan for this going forward is to eat some fruit (also company provided) when I feel the craving for something sweet. At home, the story is a bit different. My kitchen is 100% up to speed, so it&#39;s been a lot of frozen pizzas, peanut butter sammiches, and fried potatoes... also, there&#39;s a Taco Bell three minute&#39;s walking distance from me... and a 7-11 one and half minutes walking distance with many tasty sugary goods. Not eating at these places is going to be an exercise in will power.</p>
<p>Will power is a nice segue into exercise. I made the 1700 mile journey from my home with my bike strapped to the back of my car with the intention of using it as transportation for my daily commute. And I have indeed done that for a select few days. However, I&#39;m finding it harder and harder to motivate myself to exert this much effort early in the morning. Having a bike tire go flat and the bad tire that caused it has not helped. Short story made shorter, I need to stop being lazy.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - This has been ever present on my mind since my last day at Griffin. Moving has been no cheap task and my money reserves have been draining quite quickly. Higher rent, the cost of shipping my stuff out west, and the gas burned to get here are the biggest offenders, but also the lackluster final paycheck threw off the balance. Luckily, my first LI check and relocation money should be arriving soon and I will at least not have to worry about whether all the bills will get paid. If you read the paragraphs above, you know I don&#39;t have any fears about keeping fed. But, when that money does come in, a lot of it will be sunk into furniture-ing up my apartment as most of it was left behind. Also, that trip to Japan is going to be a huge cash suck. I think given a month or two, my financial outlook will be looking much, much better though and I should be able to hit all the goals I set out for in the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - With stability comes free time for me to again pick up the reigns of foreign language study. My intent was to have a better working knowledge for the trip, but that hasn&#39;t panned out due to my own laziness and the craziness of the situation around me. I&#39;m sad to say that my brother, who took his first college course on the subject, is now far more fluent in the language than I. くそ！</p>
<p>So, the reports to come should be interesting as I think my life stage has aligned itself with my intended goals. All I need to do is get my fat, lazy ass in gear and act upon them.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>How Do You Feel?</h2><time>April 22, 2013</time><div><p>With the eve of my big move fast approaching, I have been saying my farewells and with it comes a phrase that is becoming quite tiresome.</p>
<p>How do you feel?</p>
<p>Unlike Spock in Star Trek IV, I understand the question fine. However, my answer is the same. I don&#39;t really have one.</p>
<p>Moving several states west is, indeed, a very large &quot;life event&quot; and I am fully aware of this. Working for the company running the fourteenth most visited website in the <em>world</em> is no small thing to sneeze at. This is essentially my dream coming true: living in Silicon Valley making a living programming. I&#39;ve only wanted this for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And yet, I don&#39;t have any strong feelings about this. My general response thus far has been &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hit me yet&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m very excited that this opportunity has landed in my lap. As stated, it is my dream come true (at least, one of them). Being able to essentially start my life on a clean slate is certainly appealing and the potential for the future is quite bright.</p>
<p>To that end, I&#39;m also saddened that I have to leave such wonderful people behind. My family and all the friends that I&#39;ve made over the past few years are no longer going to be within quick driving distance. The &quot;clean slate&quot; I mentioned will apply here as well, moving into a state I don&#39;t know, full of people I don&#39;t know, and a culture that is going to baffle the crap out of this Oklahoma native.</p>
<p>But, I don&#39;t feel very strongly any of these emotions. It could very well be that the gravity of the adventure before me <em>hasn&#39;t</em> wormed its way from the conscious part of my brain to the emotion part. But, as I was driving back from my good-bye visit to my family, I had another thought.</p>
<p>I&#39;m ready.</p>
<p>Everything I&#39;ve done up to this point - starting from about the time I started working on YPN in earnest - has been to break into &quot;the industry&quot;. I had my shot back in 2009 when I <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">interviewed at Digg</a>, but looking back, I was nowhere near ready, neither as a developer nor as a person. Since then, I&#39;ve slowly acquired knowledge on both fronts, honing my craft, making friends and learning to better interface with people on a professional and personal level, and just learning how to live in general. It&#39;s been a slow but steady ascent to where I am now and every little experience has prepared me for what I&#39;m about to do.</p>
<p>LinkedIn and California... I&#39;m ready for you.</p>
