<p>You would make me read something emotional at work. I&#39;ll get you for that &gt;_&gt;. But now on to seriousness.</p>
<p>The last twenty-five years have certainly been an experience. Be it good times, bad times or anything in between, you guys have always been there and, more importantly, we&#39;ve always been together no matter the situation. I don&#39;t think I can convey just how important that has been to me, but I can certainly tell you that it has helped to shape my very core. Even just the simple act of eating together and conversing about whatever is something that I&#39;ve especially come to appreciate the last few years, something I will sorely miss.</p>
<p>The other item I specifically want to express my gratitude for is your openness. Being open about situations in the family, open about the pursuit of my passions, open about your thoughts on whatever situation I had to throw at you. I cannot tell you how important it&#39;s been to me and my development as a person to experience the world for what it is, not through some rose-colored, sheltered glasses. Has it always been easy? Fuck no, that&#39;s not how the world works! But like was said, we learn from mistakes, be it our own or others and I&#39;ve certainly learned a lot just from failing and I plan to continue to fail and learn from those failures in the future.</p>
<p>I also want to apologize myself for all the dumbass things that I&#39;ve done, both as a child and as an adult who should know better. So, for every hole I put in a wall, every object I&#39;ve thrown, every hurtful word I&#39;ve ever uttered, every bear I freed from a baby mobile: I&#39;m sorry.</p>
<p>You guys are the most kick ass family that I could possibly ever have asked for and I love all of you. I only hope that I can raise my own family to be a fraction as awesome as you all have been.</p>
<p>Rock on!</p>

Now that all that&#39;s out of the way, let&#39;s focus on more important things.</p>
<p>Through various happenings and goings on, two of my brothers and I challenged each other to a drawing contest of sorts. We would each choose a picture to draw and all three of us would have to draw said pictures. Over the course of three hours this afternoon we engaged in the most passive aggressive combat of all time.</p>
<p>Before I leap into the pictures themselves, a quick overview of who my challengers were. First was my 14-year-old brother Steve and second was my 11-year-old brother Joe. Was this a fair fight with me being 24? No, no it was not. Onward!

<p>Well, it&#39;s once again that time of year. Wait... I&#39;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>In celebration of the upcoming Easter season, I have gone and hidden an easter egg right here my little ol&#39; website. I task you, my wonderful viewers, to find this easter egg and, once you&#39;ve found it, post either a screen shot or description of the egg right here in the comments. The first person to find it just very well may get a prize of some sort (maybe an old game I don&#39;t want or a drawing or whatever).</p>
<p>SO! Put on your detective eyes and clicking things, scrutinizing pixels, inspecting source code, whatever. How will you know you&#39;ve found it? Oh, trust me. You&#39;ll know...</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like <em>less</em> progress than the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots">screen shots</a> I put up previously, but it does demonstrate some things that static pictures cannot: &quot;motion&quot; and audio.</p>
<p>As can be seen by that video, the graphics have quite some major problems and will be my next area of concern. However, I did get jumping between scenario files working and, in theory, the entire game is playable. After getting the graphics to a place I can live with, I plan on rolling out the public beta for people to tinker with.</p>

<p>Today I got a basic graphics stack implemented and working, though it&#39;s riddled with its fair share of bugs and is certainly nowhere near being feature complete (environmental objects, animation, etc). However, I&#39;m having no problem running through entire scenario files having completed the first day in Kanon with no problems. But, on to the screenshots (note - the following where all taken in Chrome 12.0.712.0 dev)!</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss3.jpg" alt="" title="An astute observation."></p>
<p>Because my ultimate goal is to have this working for mobile platforms, I&#39;ve been testing against my iPhone (at least until I&#39;ve got an iPad). Here&#39;s some screens:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss4.jpg" alt="" title="I even gave it a schwanky icon."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss5.jpg" alt="" title="Lookin&#39; fine!"></p>
<p>I haven&#39;t yet implemented scaling to the device&#39;s screen size (the screen above was pinch-zoomed to the correct size).</p>
<p>I&#39;m okay with the graphics stack for the time being, so I&#39;m going to begin work on one of the last major hurdles with jumping between different scenario files. I&#39;m hoping to have an open beta up soon and hopefully get some feedback from people with various devices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
