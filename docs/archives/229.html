<p>Okay, it&#39;s a quick pencil sketch but at least there&#39;s a comic.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this would have made a great &quot;Frank and Earnest&quot; Plagiarist comic. Damn :-P.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t comment on Friday&#39;s comment as it&#39;s fairly self explanitory (if you&#39;ve seen Lord of the Rings and are male, that is). So I will bare my soul on today&#39;s comic which touches on a topic very, very close to my heart. Yes... cookies. Anybody who knows me knows that I am the Cookie King. When the holiday baking begins and the cookies are stockpiled in the freezer I begin siphoning deliciousness from this <em>motherlode</em> much to the dismay of everybody else come Christmas day. Would I kill Famous Amos for his <em>ginormous</em> stockpile of chocochunkeroos? Yes... yes I would. And again if I had to!!</p>
