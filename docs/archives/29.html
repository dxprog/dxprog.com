However, I have done well on resisting the urge for the most part. I did line up a couple things for pre-order and have settled on the number of $50/mo to satisfy my urge to purchase Japanese items. Also, unbeknownst to me, Amazon decided that they would charge me for Prime without notice once my trial had ended. Now I have Prime. Generally when it comes to online ordering, I trade patience for money and go with the cheapest shipping option, but I guess that&#39;s moot now. Also, I&#39;ll probably be purchasing from Amazon instead of rightstuf just so I can somewhat justify the money they have taken from me. I did do some spontaneous &quot;gifting&quot; of things last week, which was some money gone not planned. That shouldn&#39;t, however, become anything regular.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Lackluster week on the exercise front. I did not get out for the usual afternoon walks as often as I should have which also caused Mr. Helton to pull ahead of me in steps. I&#39;m putting my foot down on that this week (get it?). I&#39;ve still managed to stay away from most fast food, a trip to Cici&#39;s with my family notwithstanding. Interestingly, I haven&#39;t even had the urge for the late night McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell trip. Or even to go there at all. I&#39;ve done my best to have <em>something</em> hanging around the house for when those urges occur, usually in the form of some kind of sandwich. Or delicious bread pudding. It&#39;s not good for me, but at least it&#39;s not processed, right?</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Not too much new here. I did get <a href="http://kanacards.us">Kanacards</a> to a (mostly) usable state and have been doing vocab drills with that. There&#39;s still some development to go to make it full featured and sand down the rough edges, but it can and shall be used. The most difficult thing I&#39;m finding, however, is that my Genki book is a text book but there&#39;s no syllabus to go with it. So, I&#39;m trudging along as best I can.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I hooked my Wacom back up to my computer at some point this week.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong> - It has been two weeks since my last Taco Bell trip and I haven&#39;t even eaten McDonald&#39;s in the 2013 year, so we&#39;re doing well there. Didn&#39;t walk as much as I&#39;d wanted this week, but got out every weekday last week. Also, I invested in a <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/one">fitbit</a> to keep track of all my exercise related things. It&#39;s a nifty little device and has pitted me in heated combat with a certain <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">Morgan Helton</a>. It also tracks my sleeping habits by measuring my movements during sleep. If I read the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/user/24DRCF/sleep">graph right</a>, I could make a convincing dead man once I lose consciousness for the day. Probably also explains why I never have dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Well, I did buy the fitbit, but I figure if it&#39;s in the interest of any item on this list, it&#39;s worth shelling out money for. Otherwise, I&#39;ve kept a reign in for the most part, especially on eating out (which has been mostly relegated to the weekends). It&#39;s getting harder and harder not to pre-order some of the shows I want to own, though. I may time them out to once a month or something.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did a couple of worksheets in my book, but have not spent near enough time on this. However, I began work on a <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/kanacards">web app</a> to help drill vocabulary. My brother who is also taking Japanese (at a real college) will be sharing this tool with me and we can learn from each other.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Have you ever noticed that central time seems so much more logical than any of the other timezones? Prime time starts at 7pm, usually right around the time the evening meal is ending and you&#39;re ready to just relax for a while. You don&#39;t get that in the eastern timezone.</p>

Today, I&#39;d like to welcome Steve - yet another of my many, many brothers - to our little band of reviews. Today we&#39;ll be delving into the characters that did and didn&#39;t do it for us.</p>
<h2 id="worst-character">Worst Character</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_hina.jpg" alt="" title="Hina Takanashi">
<strong>Chris - <em>Hina Takanashi (Listen to Me, Girls, I am Your Father)</em></strong>
Holy gay sex, Batman, if I hated one character more than any in 2012, it was Hina Takanashi.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering how I can find it within myself to hate a character who is a mere three years old. Kids are adorable, right? Not universally, because her character annoyed me to such a degree I could hardly bear it at times.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the voice, because whatever old wench they got to voice this character poured every ounce of wince inducing vocalization she could into this character. Real children have high pitched voices, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they&#39;re not grating in the way this one is, and real three year olds certainly don&#39;t speak with the mental capacity of someone much older.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s another thing: this kid is far too rational when it comes to emotional matters. Whilst the rest of the characters have a hard time coping with the death of their mother/sister, Hina spends one minute down at the very end crying about it before she grows a pair entirely too large for her age/gender and spouts off some sort of psychiatrist shit and immediately learns to cope with the fact that her parents are DEAD. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this kid popped out of the fucking womb with a doctorate in psychology.</p>
<p>And for the love of God, will the other characters just stop giving her dick shaped food?

<p><strong>Health</strong> - On the upside, I managed to keep my eating of fast food to a minimum; one trip to Taco Bell late one evening. However, the pizza that work brought in on Friday probably negates that. I&#39;ve also found out that no amount of granola bars will stave off hunger for very long. In the world of exercise, I did manage at least 45 minutes of walking every work day, no small feat considering the cold turn the weather has made. I need to add something more into the mix, though, be it treadmill, push ups, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - There were actually a couple days last week where I didn&#39;t spend any money at all. Score! The purchasing of some poster frames and a limited pressing of the <a href="http://iamshark.limitedrun.com/products/508090-star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace-ost-2xlp-limited">Episode I soundtrack on LP</a> were the only real unnecessary buys last week. I successfully did stave off the desire to purchase a couple of manga this weekend, so score. I&#39;m going to try and Scrooge it the rest of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did an hours worth of work two days last week. There were plenty of times I thought about picking them up later on only to take a nap instead. I have no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Yeah...</p>

<h2 id="biggest-surprise">Biggest Surprise</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_my_little_monster.jpg" alt="" title="My Little Monster">
<strong>Chris - <em>My Little Monster</em></strong>
When 2012 started, little did I know that I would close out the year by watching a shoujo title, which -- let&#39;s not beat around the bush here -- are made for girls.  But I did.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>What I found in My Little Monster was a great little romcom with some great characters and a good -- if not flip-floppy -- central romance.  While the show&#39;s shoujo roots are apparent in the art style, most everything in the show is enjoyable even by manly men.  Best of all, there was no gaggle of wooden male characters -- I&#39;m looking at you Hiiro no Kakera.</p>
<p>The only real problem I had was the somewhat disappointing ending, or rather, the lack of an ending.  Few of the plot threads were wrapped up, leading me to hope that a second season is around the corner -- and let me tell you, I would love to see that.
