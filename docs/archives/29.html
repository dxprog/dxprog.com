Today, I&#39;d like to welcome Steve - yet another of my many, many brothers - to our little band of reviews. Today we&#39;ll be delving into the characters that did and didn&#39;t do it for us.</p>
<h2 id="worst-character">Worst Character</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_hina.jpg" alt="" title="Hina Takanashi">
<strong>Chris - <em>Hina Takanashi (Listen to Me, Girls, I am Your Father)</em></strong>
Holy gay sex, Batman, if I hated one character more than any in 2012, it was Hina Takanashi.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering how I can find it within myself to hate a character who is a mere three years old. Kids are adorable, right? Not universally, because her character annoyed me to such a degree I could hardly bear it at times.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the voice, because whatever old wench they got to voice this character poured every ounce of wince inducing vocalization she could into this character. Real children have high pitched voices, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they&#39;re not grating in the way this one is, and real three year olds certainly don&#39;t speak with the mental capacity of someone much older.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s another thing: this kid is far too rational when it comes to emotional matters. Whilst the rest of the characters have a hard time coping with the death of their mother/sister, Hina spends one minute down at the very end crying about it before she grows a pair entirely too large for her age/gender and spouts off some sort of psychiatrist shit and immediately learns to cope with the fact that her parents are DEAD. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this kid popped out of the fucking womb with a doctorate in psychology.</p>
<p>And for the love of God, will the other characters just stop giving her dick shaped food?

<p><strong>Health</strong> - On the upside, I managed to keep my eating of fast food to a minimum; one trip to Taco Bell late one evening. However, the pizza that work brought in on Friday probably negates that. I&#39;ve also found out that no amount of granola bars will stave off hunger for very long. In the world of exercise, I did manage at least 45 minutes of walking every work day, no small feat considering the cold turn the weather has made. I need to add something more into the mix, though, be it treadmill, push ups, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - There were actually a couple days last week where I didn&#39;t spend any money at all. Score! The purchasing of some poster frames and a limited pressing of the <a href="http://iamshark.limitedrun.com/products/508090-star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace-ost-2xlp-limited">Episode I soundtrack on LP</a> were the only real unnecessary buys last week. I successfully did stave off the desire to purchase a couple of manga this weekend, so score. I&#39;m going to try and Scrooge it the rest of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did an hours worth of work two days last week. There were plenty of times I thought about picking them up later on only to take a nap instead. I have no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Yeah...</p>

<h2 id="biggest-surprise">Biggest Surprise</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_my_little_monster.jpg" alt="" title="My Little Monster">
<strong>Chris - <em>My Little Monster</em></strong>
When 2012 started, little did I know that I would close out the year by watching a shoujo title, which -- let&#39;s not beat around the bush here -- are made for girls.  But I did.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>What I found in My Little Monster was a great little romcom with some great characters and a good -- if not flip-floppy -- central romance.  While the show&#39;s shoujo roots are apparent in the art style, most everything in the show is enjoyable even by manly men.  Best of all, there was no gaggle of wooden male characters -- I&#39;m looking at you Hiiro no Kakera.</p>
<p>The only real problem I had was the somewhat disappointing ending, or rather, the lack of an ending.  Few of the plot threads were wrapped up, leading me to hope that a second season is around the corner -- and let me tell you, I would love to see that.

<p>And what a shaming I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I have eaten out several times this week (once being Taco Bell) and had a drinking party last night. Granted, my brother is in town and we&#39;re celebrating New Year&#39;s a bit belatedly, so I&#39;m going to write it off this once. On the upside, I have made more food and not had McDonald&#39;s in this thirteenth year of the 21st century.

The categories are changed up slightly from last year, but remain more or less the same. But, enough intro, here&#39;s Chris and I&#39;s favorite tunes of the year.</p>
<h2 id="best-opening">Best Opening</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - <em>Crossing Field (Sword Art Online)</em></strong>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMDwrRNTp8M&amp;youtube-thumb"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/gMDwrRNTp8M/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p>It would be inaccurate to state that I know how to explain music, or why I like certain songs more than others. Unfortunately, my cognitive capacity for this activity is far outweighed by the naturalness of describing things assaulting my other, far more supple senses.</p>
<p>But here goes.</p>
<p>This song kicks ass – I can’t explain why, but that is the way of things, and that is how they are. Also, there’s some pretty kick-flippin’ animation in the opener that probably rivaled in budget the entirety of Space Brothers.</p>
<p>OH, SNAP.
