<p>It&#39;s 7pm as I write this. The thought of returning to the interwebs feels kind of like how it felt to return to Griffin, something I find odd and slightly disconcerting...</p>
<p>Made a trip down the turnpike yesterday for a surprise visit to Chris. Snacks were had and Monopoly was played, just like olden days. I also read all six of his volumes of Future Diary since. I suppose you could say I&#39;m hooked...</p>
<p>Jeff and I shall soon be lighting up another fire in the fireplace tonight. Staring at its mesmerizing glow should eat up a couple or so hours.</p>
<p>Less than 300 minutes remain...</p>

<p>In less than 36 hours, I will again be able to dip my toes in the vast ocean of the internet. It is a moment I eagerly await.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the most difficult day yet. It was a dreadfully slow day at work which left me wanting to surf the old stand bys (reddit, youtube, facebook, etc.) Instead, I spent time combing the news sites, reading articles, and contemplating performance improvements.</p>
<p>At home, things aren&#39;t so bad. I can nap or read or whatever. I&#39;ve nearly finished all of my Toradora manga, leaving Oreimo and Yotsuba on my high priority pile.</p>
<p>One day...</p>

<p>Over half way in and my resolve to not turn on the computer is holding. Still, I wonder often how the karma seeds I planted over the weekend are doing. I am far too concerned with this arbitrary number...</p>
<p>Finished both the Hobbit and Madoka 2 tonight. This was probably my most enjoyable read of the Hobbit, knowing the story of LotR and also just being old enough to understand it all. Still, I found Tolkien&#39;s prose to be a highly annoying in places. His odd phrasings and lack of correct comma usage made some bits difficult to read. But even so, enjoyable nontheless.</p>
<p>Three days...</p>

<p>So, I skipped writing anything yesterday. Slept right through it, I did. An interesting thing to note about how my sleep habits have changed: they&#39;re actually getting worse. The last two nights I&#39;ve woken in in the middle of sleeping for no apparent reason. Usually, this only happens when I&#39;m under great stress. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself stressed right now; annoyed, but not stressed.</p>
<p>In terms of reading, I am now half way through three books: The Hobbit, Oreimo, and Madoka 2. Jeff and I also rediscovered the joy of Stratego this evening even though it ended in stalemate. Four days...</p>

<p>It&#39;s been nearly twenty-four hours since I last surfed the social web. Despite the cravings I&#39;ve had to see how my karma seeds are growing, I haven&#39;t found it too difficult to not turn the computer on. At work, I kept myself busy with actual work and these math/programming challenges Mickael dug up. At home, I did wind up watching HIMYM because I didn&#39;t feel like torrenting it next week. But since, I&#39;ve kept myself busy with a walk to Wal-mart, making and consuming pumpkin bread, and gratuitous reading. Now, I am drawing myself a batch and will probably read and then turn in.</p>
<p>Six days left...</p>
