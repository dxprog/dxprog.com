<p>Bros came over this weekend, always good times to be had there. We&#39;ve been watching anime, aging games and doing tragic us amounts of asking. Probably five to six miles today alone. We visited the usual nerd places and hit up a thrift store I pursuit of cosplay items.</p>
<p>Speaking of costly, I&#39;ve gotten quite a bit farther on my costume and it&#39;s not looking terrible. The more I do is the easier it&#39;s becoming, so that&#39;s always encouraging. I would post a picture, but that would ruin the surprise or something.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been our using OkCupid again and realize why I kind of dropped it in e first ace: it&#39;s full of hyper Christians who also happen to be young, single moms. I don&#39;t mean to judge, but that seems a tad contradictory...</p>
<p>Tonight, my bros snood I are going to cool off at the pool and, as we wait for said pool to drain of people, I am sitting her writing a blog post. That brings us to now.</p>

Being that I actually have culinary skills, I&#39;ve made some pretty bitchin&#39; things. There was the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-letter-to-my-dearest-mother">potato salad</a>, of course, but here are some other things that have graced my table and stomach.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/food_pancakes.jpg" alt="" title="Yumness">
I used to make a lot of pancakes in college (with various extras) because they&#39;re <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/detail.aspx">freakin&#39; easy</a> and cheap. Remembering that, relived the experience my first week in the apartment. Also decided to toss in some eggs and sausage because they are quite delicious. The eggs are a little dirty looking because I scrambled them in the sausage grease. Mmmmm......</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/food_salad.jpg" alt="" title="And it&#39;s healthy!">
A couple weeks ago, I got this crazy hankering for a good salad. Just tossed around some lettuce, tomatoes and cheese along with some deli meat I had lying around (it&#39;d have gone bad soon, anyways). It was pretty awesome, but there was actually more than I could handle over the course of several days and the rest had to be tossed. Not used to cooking small quantities, am I.</p>

My supper last night. This is a dish affectionately known in my family as &quot;turkey balls&quot;. It&#39;s really nothing more than slightly browned balls of ground turkey simmered in some cream of mushroom soup and milk. I also mixed an egg and some breadcrumbs into the ground turkey. On top of rice, this is a pretty awesome meal.</p>

I was, at one point, going to film several little skits or vignettes about the untimely demise of Peeps, but really only finished one. However, for the first time ever, you can see the unfinished, unreleased opening!</p>

Fun fact: the fat kid in the commercial - my brother Chris - is very not fat now.</p>

Using a sewing machine kindly borrowed from my sisters, I laid down the first stitches to that end today.</p>
<p>I spent the first thirty minutes battling the contraption before I decided to just google the damn thing. I eventually stumbled upon some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEvMTv2xVg">scrap book sewing how to video</a> that happened to be using mostly the same model of machine I had (same machine, different paint job).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sewing_2.jpg" alt="" title="The screwdriver was the remains of my failed battle"></p>
<p>After watching all twentyish minutes of tutorial, I was finally up and running and created a successful debug output piece.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sewing_1.jpg" alt="" title="Fancyness"></p>
<p>With all the pre-work out of the way, I got started on one of the pieces. It turned out pretty shitty and I&#39;ve got nine more to go...</p>
