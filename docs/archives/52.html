The ordeal went down like this:</p>
<p><em>walks over to iPad table in Apple store like a boss</em></p>
<p>Apple dude: Hi! Can I help you?</p>
<p>Me: 16GB wifi iPads. Have any?</p>
<p>Apple chick: I have one. Black.</p>
<p>Me: It&#39;s mine!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s verbatim how it went down.</p>
<p>I am enjoying this thing, as I thought I would. My eyes particularly enjoy the very large screen. Been checking out the apps available and sighing over the apps I have that aren&#39;t iPad formatted (lookin&#39; at you, Skype).</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve been looking for options for iOS development on Windows and have a few things I&#39;m going to try. Whilst I may have caved to Apple once again for mobile computing, I refuse to use OS X in areas where I can avoid it.</p>
<p>And just as soon as somebody hacks Windows 8 for this thing, iOS is gone....</p>
<p>(no more blog posts typed on this thing...)</p>

<p>Pretty sure I promised pictures some time ago. Well, my iPhone sucks at taking pictures and video is better. Plus, it gave me an excuse to bust out some kinetic typography!</p>

<p>Ha! Now there&#39;s a title!</p>
<p>This year my bros and I will be attending <a href="http://www.tokyointulsa.com/">Tokyo in Tulsa</a> - a local anime convention - much as we did last year. However, this year not only will we be splurging on all three days, but we&#39;ll be shedding all our inhibitions and cosplaying. Well, at the very least I will. This is my fourth con, after all.</p>
<p>In addition to the costume getup itself, I am using this as an excuse to get my sorry ass into better shape. Since I&#39;ve started my new job, I&#39;ve been spending most of my lunch breaks climbing the stairs to the top of the building, about seventeen floors. In addition, lately I have also been walking around the small park adjacent to the building after said stair climbing (about a third of a mile or so).</p>
<p>Now, however, I will be stepping it up even more. My apartment has a pretty decent exercise facility and I plan to take advantage of it. So, tonight when everybody else has gone to sleep, I and my iPhone will make a trip across to the office and I will hit the treadmills.</p>
<p>My goal is that in the month and a half until the con, I can lose <em>some</em> of the fat roll and maybe even bring myself under 200 again. Honestly, that last part wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch - couple pounds a week, really.</p>
<p>So shall it be written, so shall it be done!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-balding-truth">The Balding Truth</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 2, 2011</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>So, I was watching a video today and the pre-roll ad was for some hair restoration product/service (don&#39;t recall which). At some point, one of the testimonials was all about how much more confidence this guy had now that he wasn&#39;t balding. And I&#39;m all like... you really rely on your hair to instill confidence? Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but I&#39;ve never understood what was so terrible about balding.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;ve always relished the thought of a receding hairline (sadly, the general consensus is that those genes passed me over). Sure, I&#39;ve always hated my hair and the fuss that must be made over it so it doesn&#39;t look stupid, but I&#39;ve always thought of bald as being both bad ass and/or dignified.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t share that mindset? Let&#39;s look at some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/patrick_stewart.jpg" alt="" title="Make it so!"></p>
<p>This guy has made his career out of being bald...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/bruce_willis.jpg" alt="" title="Yipee-ki-yay"></p>
<p>...and Mr. Willis here has proven that you can still be bad ass without hair (even if you make a shitty movie based upon a complete lack of knowledge of computers).</p>
<p>My only guess as to the negative imagery would probably be people who went bald, tried to correct it and failed:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/donald_trump.jpg" alt="" title="I demand your hair show it&#39;s birth certificate!"></p>
<p>My answer: just shave your head and stop worrying about it. Certainly don&#39;t go basing all your confidence on its existence.</p>
<p>Now, that beer belly is something different...</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/unfulfilled-promises">Unfulfilled Promises</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 1, 2011</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>So, I have here this blog that I have so lovingly hand crafted in a glorified ASCII text editor. Some thousands of dollars of marketable man hours all of them for free, all of them for me. So, in an attempt to get my money&#39;s worth out of all my hard word, I will attempt a blog post every day in June.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have things to blog about. After all, I just moved to a new town, into my own apartment (all by my lonesome this time); my brother and I are having a bit of a game programming contest (again); more words (followed by some in parenthesis).</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I am at a loss with what to do with all this &quot;free time&quot; I have acquired. I don&#39;t have cool, awesome bros to hang out with all the time and with my huge commute gone, I&#39;ve got another couple hours added on to my day.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve got tons of shit to keep me entertained. There are games to be played, movies to be watched, things to be programmed, shit to be filmed and motion to be graphicsed. And yet, I find myself spending most of my time just surfing the internet, napping and being bored. Perhaps I&#39;m just on the slow, rising edge of the curve and will get used to it later.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the additional items that I must do in order to sustain life that I did not have to before: cooking and cleaning, primarily. I must make my own food or, if I&#39;m feeling too lazy to do that, must get unlazy enough to go and procure some from a vendor of nourishment. On the whole, I prefer to spend less money for food that will negate my feeble efforts to maintain some semblance of fitness (more on this later).</p>
<p>The most annoying part of making my own food is the fact that I must wash a variety of various instruments just to do so (this is where the cleaning comes in). All is well and good once this is done, but then said instruments must then be dirtied again. It&#39;s a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are some thoughts for today (made it with a little over an hour to spare). I&#39;ll try to conjure up some good lunchtime thoughts or perhaps code snippets to make the rest of the month more than just my mundane, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8">nichijou</a>.</p>
