<p>A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like <em>less</em> progress than the [screen shots)(<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots">http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots</a>) I put up previously, but it does demonstrate some things that static pictures cannot: &quot;motion&quot; and audio.</p>
<p>As can be seen by that video, the graphics have quite some major problems and will be my next area of concern. However, I did get jumping between scenario files working and, in theory, the entire game is playable. After getting the graphics to a place I can live with, I plan on rolling out the public beta for people to tinker with.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots">JsLive - Progress Report and Screenshots</a></h2><time>April 2, 2011</time><div><p>After Friday&#39;s more <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/its-like-nes-emulator-dev-all-over">technical post</a>, today I strive to show actual progress on what I&#39;ve deemed to call JsLive.</p>
<p>Today I got a basic graphics stack implemented and working, though it&#39;s riddled with its fair share of bugs and is certainly nowhere near being feature complete (environmental objects, animation, etc). However, I&#39;m having no problem running through entire scenario files having completed the first day in Kanon with no problems. But, on to the screenshots (note - the following where all taken in Chrome 12.0.712.0 dev)!</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss3.jpg" alt="" title="An astute observation."></p>
<p>Because my ultimate goal is to have this working for mobile platforms, I&#39;ve been testing against my iPhone (at least until I&#39;ve got an iPad). Here&#39;s some screens:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss4.jpg" alt="" title="I even gave it a schwanky icon."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss5.jpg" alt="" title="Lookin&#39; fine!"></p>
<p>I haven&#39;t yet implemented scaling to the device&#39;s screen size (the screen above was pinch-zoomed to the correct size).</p>
<p>I&#39;m okay with the graphics stack for the time being, so I&#39;m going to begin work on one of the last major hurdles with jumping between different scenario files. I&#39;m hoping to have an open beta up soon and hopefully get some feedback from people with various devices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

You will soon be mine!"></p>
<p>Somewhere around the time I began working at Wal-Mart, I thought it would be a nice challenge to write an <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/one-week-anniversary/">NES emulator</a>. One of these days I&#39;ll release my mess of source code for that, but it was probably one of the most awesome programming challenges I&#39;ve ever undertaken. So, why am I waxing nostalgic about this project from nearly six years ago? (warning - there&#39;s technical programmy talk inside)[break]</p>
<p>Well, you may have garnered from <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2010-reviews-finale/">posts past</a> that I may or may not have played visual novels of some anime shows I&#39;ve seen (I have). In particular, those would be Clannad and Kanon. I&#39;ve not fully completed either of these games because, let&#39;s face it, hunching over a computer reading gratuitous amounts of text is tiring. However, I believe the visual novel format would work well on tablet PCs. Interestingly enough, both of these games as well as most things from Key/VisualArts run on a system called <a href="http://haven.parodius.com/formats/#reallive">RealLive</a>. The actual scenario file for each game is a custom scripting language unique to the RealLive engine. My goal is to make an HTML5 based interpreter so I can make these games available to mobile platforms.</p>
<p>This is where the parallel to NES emulators come: I have to reconstruct the functions, logic, etc. that the RealLive system has in JavaScript and HTML. However, whereas emulating a 6502 is just a series of super basic functions (add the accumulator to the X register and jump if the carry flag was set), this is a whole new level of complexity. It&#39;s more akin to writing a C compiler, really. Take this for example:</p>
<p>[code=Kepago]strS[1900] += strS[1900][/code]</p>
<p>Now, in human terms this is pretty simple: add the value of strS[1900] to itself. However, getting a computer to understand this behaviour is something quite different. After a little googling, this is apparently an operation called lexical analysis. My solution is actually a two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>A PHP script parses the decompiled source code and converts the above into a JSON format like so:</li>
</ol>
<p>[code=JSON]{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;assign&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;strS[1900]&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;strS[1901]&quot;,&quot;operation&quot;:&quot;+=&quot;,&quot;ln&quot;:18487}[/code]</p>
<p>Name is what&#39;s on the left hand side of the equation, operation is the operator and value is the right hand side of the operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Now. that format was setup before I realized that true language parsing was going to be required, so at this point my JavaScript is reconstructing the original equation from those variables. It passes these off to a function called &quot;evaluateExpression&quot; which figures out what&#39;s a string, variable, function, number, operator, etc. and remaps everything so that it points to internal functions and variables. This string would then look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>[code=JavaScript]variables[&quot;strS[1900]&quot;] += variables[&quot;strS[1900]&quot;][/code]</p>
<p>This string is then run through <em>eval</em> and is parsed by JS natively (allowing me to cop out of writing the really difficult stuff).</p>
<p>So, at this point, I have most all of the branching and logic functions working correctly (as far as I&#39;m aware) in addition to the sound and music (super simple stuff). Now I&#39;m working towards getting the core graphics functions in place which should get me pretty close to a playable state.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had a programming project that&#39;s been this enjoyable and branched me off into new territory. I, for one, welcome it.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/whatever-happened-to-childrens-educational-programming">Whatever happened to children&#x27;s educational programming?</a></h2><time>March 25, 2011</time><div><p>I&#39;m pretty sure we can all agree that children&#39;s television nowadays pretty much sucks across the board, doubly so for anything that even tries to enter the realm of things educational. Why is it that if you&#39;re going to try to teach a kid something it has to be packaged in a brightly colored, make-the-kids-talk-to-the-TV-like-they&#39;re-actually-doing-something-and-then-proceed-to-talk-down-to-them package (Say MAP! What? I can&#39;t hear you? You gotta speak SPANISH, dipshit!). Well, I tell you what. Back in my day, we had AWESOME educational TV! Allow me a meander down memory lane...[break]</p>
<h2 id="square-one">Square One</h2>
<p>A children&#39;s variety show about math. Yes, MATH! This is a show that got Weird Al to sing about geometrical <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Iidlj5GzM">patterns</a>, had a segment using Qbert to teach positive/negative numbers and closed every episode with a parody of Dragnet called Mathnet. These guys were geniuses!</p>
<h2 id="where-in-the-world-is-carmen-san-diego">Where in the World is Carmen San Diego</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure of the exact origins of this. All I know is that my bros and I would religiously watch this geography-based game show every afternoon when I returned from school. I didn&#39;t know crap about geography (still don&#39;t), but that didn&#39;t stop me from thinking that I could place this markers better than whatever scrawny kid was doing it that day. Oh, it also had one of the most kick-ass <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdzyuJJZMCI">themes of any show ever</a>.</p>
<h2 id="beakman-s-world">Beakman&#39;s World</h2>
<p>I suppose you could call this the 90s homage to another entry on this list, but Beakman&#39;s World was my introduction to the world of science TV. Now, I&#39;ll admit that this show to a degree suffers from the dumbing down for children I was talking about above (the guy in the rat suit, the silliness factor overall and all the toilet humor), but in the end science was explained. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxr4_cccAF0">clip that seems rather timely</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mr-rogers">Mr. Rogers</h2>
<p>Now, I suppose this could be one of the weaker entries on this list, but Mr. Rogers did make frequent excursions to various places such as factories or research centers or whatever. These were the parts of the show I was most fascinated with (that and the trolley). Also, Mr. Rogers was a freakin&#39; saint on Earth, a man who truly practiced what he preached. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upm9LnuCBUM">&#39;97 Emmy award acceptance speech</a> damn near gets me choked up. Oh, and as a final note, he single handedly saved public television.</p>
<h2 id="mr-wizard-s-world">Mr. Wizard&#39;s World</h2>
<p>Finally, the coup de grace. Mr. Wizard had to be the best science show on television ever of all time. He covered everything from air pressure to atomic power to the internals of an Atari 2600. Sure, some stuff is dated by today&#39;s standards (word processors, anyone), but even now I am still fascinated by this show. I believe what really makes this work is his laid back attitude and explaining things in a manner that was understandable, but never using diminishing language. Hell, this guy was so awesome even Beakman&#39;s World, something one could consider a knock-off, named the two penguin puppets after Mr. Wizard: Don and Herbert. Rest in peace, Mr. Wizard!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll toss in a quick honorable mention to Bill Nye (the last of the big science guys), but I didn&#39;t watch his show quite as much and iirc, he delved more in science theory rather than the live demonstration of Mr. Wizard and Beakman.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been lamenting the fact that there are no good (or maybe any) science shows for kids for quite some time, but even the rest of the landscape seems to be crumbling away as seen by these gems of my childhood. All I know is that I will do my very best to subject my spawn to these great shows and hopefully they will pull away some of the inspiration and wonder that I did.</p>

My mom tipped me off some years ago that one can curb these offers by using their own self-addressed stamped envelopes against them to have oneself removed from their mailing list.</p>
<p>Using the power of a form letter, I&#39;ve done this with great success over the years. However, I&#39;ve been getting a little more personal and creative lately, putting my box of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/crayola-commercial/">Rejection Crayons</a> to good use. These are the latest in my wave of &quot;stop the spam&quot; mail campaign.</p>
