<blockquote>
<p>Well I know new stuff in math now. Dad showed me some stuff last night. Jeff is continuing to write his Zelda book. Dad is in the living room playing the game that came with the joystick: WarBirds 2.01. It looks like alot of fun. I&#39;m gonna play it tomorrow. I fired some christmas cards off to my pen pals. Jeff is buying books in bulk. He wants 700. But I&#39;m giving him 20. That&#39;s a buck! Some dough I can add to my hastings card. Chris wants ten also. That&#39;s another 50 cents. I made it first in the die hard 500 on my Nascar game. Coming a little further on my puzzle. The water is really hard. My VBasic Classes are getting into animation now! I spent an hour doing that today! Well that&#39;s all for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminded me of a little &quot;business&quot; I had called Bookings. Bookings&#39; entire business model was centered around construction paper stapled to a few sheets of copy paper and then, apparently, sold for a nickle. Jeff was making comics at the time (something he <a href="http://square-headed.com/">still does</a>), so I attempted capitalize off of it.</p>
<p>Also, these &quot;VBasic Classes&quot; of which I mention I believe were from a book on Excel VBA and the &quot;card program&quot; was a cataloging system for baseball cards (I had/have a fair amount of Topps 1993 series cards). Apparently, that Derek Jeter rookie card is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Topps-Derek-Jeter-Rookie-Yankees/dp/B000LV7UIS">worth something</a>. And I&#39;ve got a few of those, iirc...</p>

Between this entry and the previous, I began writing in a new notebook (thus resetting the entry number count). But, this is a pretty awesome entry, if only for the memories it brings back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First Entry
Tuesday, Jan 4, 2000</p>
<p>Well we have survived. No Y2K bug anywhere. Tonight we&#39;re going to swimming. Stevie is playing computer.</p>
<p>What a great Christmas I had. got alot of neat stuff. Here&#39;s a list so you don&#39;t forget.</p>
<ol>
<li>Portable CD Player - Mom &amp; Dad</li>
<li>Cards and a card game book - M &amp; D</li>
<li>Episode I Racer - Mom &amp; Dad</li>
<li>A Great Joystick - Mom &amp; Dad</li>
<li>Nascar 2 Racing - Amy</li>
<li>A shirt - Jen</li>
<li>Star Wars Monopoly - Jen</li>
<li>Hastings Gift Card - Joey (Mom)</li>
<li>A Picture Mosaic Puzzle - Grandma</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m now e-mailing Chassidy &amp; Casey. Also Dave &amp; Dan. Jeff hasn&#39;t gotten anything back from Anthony. I haven&#39;t gotten anything back from Leah or John. I sent Christmas cards to all of my pen-pals. Well gotta run. Bye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot disagree; that was a pretty awesome Christmas. Episode I Racer I particularly have very fond memories of. Also, that joystick was the best I&#39;ve ever used (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963168-0403-WingMan-Joystick/dp/B00000JCSB">a weighted Logitech Wingman, ftr</a>). Additionally, in the time between this and the previous post, our family procured our first (modern) computer. I can still rattle off the specs:</p>
<p>Dell XPS-T450 (service tag 72y1a)</p>
<ul>
<li>450Mhz Pentium III</li>
<li>128MB RAM</li>
<li>Voodoo 3 3000 w/ 16MB VRAM</li>
<li>Turtle Beach Montego II (sound)</li>
<li>13GB HDD</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have the original mobo/cpu in my closet. Ah, good times. Good times...</p>

There should be no reason for this, especially since the content is already written and all I have to do is transcribe them. However, these two aren&#39;t quite as happy go lucky (and the entry that occurred between them was even less than happy, but at some point was lost to the annals of time). I have no comment on these, so will just present them.</p>

<p>Eighth Entry
September 21, 1999
Hi! It&#39;s been awhile since I last wrote. I got another letter from Leah. I sent one to John again. I&#39;m hoping to get a letter from him this week. [two statements redacted for personal reasons] Also the Birthright garage sale is on Friday and Mom is going to get me some art pencils. Joey is scooting around now. He is really big. Grandpa is in the hospital. It doesn&#39;t look good either. Dave came up. It was nice to visit with him. DFad is going to let me send and recieve e-mails via his address. I can&#39;t get my own because I was on QB chat. Speaking of QBasic I&#39;m making a new game. It&#39;s called Mario Mash. I&#39;m just about finished. All I need to add is sound and music. My fish is still around. He also knows a trick. When I feed him I flip the food down off the shelf and he goes crazy. We&#39;re almost finished our first month of school. It&#39;s kinda easy except for English. I&#39;m learning about the French-Indian War. It&#39;s really neat. Well gotta go. Bye!</p>

<p>Tenth Entry
October 4, 1999
The day after the last entry grandpa died. The funeral has been and everyone came up. I got to meet mom&#39;s bro Mike. We got a macintosh. It&#39;s lots of fun. I&#39;m keeping a second journal on it. I finished my Mario game. It&#39;s better then Plane Attack. Now I&#39;m going to make Rebel Attack. I have everything figured out. I got a letter from John today. I already have a letter ready to go. Well my hand is tiered so I&#39;ll wrap it up here. I forgot a few things. I got some art pencils. [statement redacted] [Mom and Dad are] talking about getting a computer right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will say that it&#39;s hard to believe that my grandpa has been dead for nearly half my life. Wish I could play one last round of checkers with him...</p>

Before that, though, a couple of birthday shout outs. Firstly, to my mom who turns old today (again). Second is to me, or rather dxprog. It was ten years ago that I chose the online moniker that I still use today. But, enough of that. Journal stuff.</p>

<p>Fifth Entry
July 29, 1999</p>
<p>Well, I got my goggles today. They&#39;re neat. The lenses are yellow. But I didn&#39;t get to test them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because that was short, here&#39;s one more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sixth Entry
August 6, 1999</p>
<p>The greatly anticipated moment has come and gone. WE&#39;VE SEEN THE PHANTOM MENACE!! It was awesome! I&#39;ve taken Jeff up as my Padawan Apprentice. He&#39;s excited. I&#39;ve also tackled something new in T-Attack... x6 and x5! We went swimming again on Tuesday. I did a flip perfectly and NO ONE WAS WATCHING!!! So I kept trying. I was going to show mom after doing several 1 1/2 flips and the DAMN WHISTLE BLEW. My foots healed. A few days ago I got my first zit. So we got some zit cream. Got another letter from my pen pal. Still need to send my letter. Tomorrow my bros and I are secretly going to make breakfast. I made a kite last Sunday. Don&#39;t know if it flys yet though. I also did B-Day shopping for Stevie with mom. Time to wrap it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much to say here, though it&#39;s funny how one&#39;s opinions of a movie can change in thirteen years. I don&#39;t hate Episode I, but I certainly do not think it&#39;s &quot;awesome&quot; anymore. That said, I can understand being excited for it as a kid.</p>
<p>Also, making public of dark secrets that I would rather have remained in the dark depths of hell: the &quot;Padawan Apprentice&quot; bit. Somewhere between thirteen and sixteen, I was really into Star Wars. Like, <em>really</em> into it. Enough so that I tried to delude myself and my brothers into thinking that I had originated from that galaxy far, far away and was reincarnated here or some shit. Call it hardcore pretend or something.</p>
<p>I had issues. But I&#39;m okay now...</p>
