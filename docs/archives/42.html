<p>Well, here we are again. It&#39;s always such a pleasure. Remember when I did this <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done/">last year</a>? I do. Seems like it wasn&#39;t that long ago. But, time flies, as they say, and with increasing age, it does so with increased velocity, it seems. This calls for some retrospective and forward contemplation.[break]</p>
<h2 id="the-previous-year">The Previous Year</h2>
<p>As linked above, last year I made a series of goals for myself to achieve. Let&#39;s look in and see how I fared on that:</p>
<p><strong>Draw more</strong> - Could probably count on two hands the amount of times I set pencil to paper for art&#39;s sake. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Finish all my Squeenix games</strong> - Despite a rocky start, I did finish Final Fantasy X-2 (from which I am still having nightmares). Never touched another game on that list. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Lost the spare tire</strong> - My weight held for most of the year, and during the summer months I made a pretty good effort to at least keep in some semblance of physical shape, between climbing the stairs in my office building and running the treadmills. That all died somewhere towards fall, though, and I&#39;ve put on weight since. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Apartment and girlfriend</strong> - Perhaps the only section on the list where I wasn&#39;t a complete failure. Upset with my conditions at my old job, I sought new and greener pastures and got the pay bump I needed to set out on my own (now I&#39;m back at that old job, but with more pay). On the girlfriend front, I&#39;ve made a handful of probes, but at this point I think I&#39;m content where I&#39;m at and will let things fall into place as they come. So, I&#39;m going to say <em>SUCCEEDED</em> on this one.</p>
<h2 id="the-coming-year">The Coming Year</h2>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve looked back on my list of past failures, let&#39;s set up a list of NEW ONES!</p>
<p><strong>MOAR EXERCISE</strong> - I have a good exercise facility at my disposal and I need to utilize it as much as I can. Goal - 3 hours of exercise per week increasing in amount and intensity as my physical endurance improves.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR GAMING</strong> - I didn&#39;t game much over the last year, but still was raking in games (no thanks to the Steam sale...). This year, I aim to finish all of those, but at the very least, this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skyward Sword</li>
<li>Catherine</li>
<li>Tales of Vesperia</li>
<li>Left 4 Dead (1 and 2)</li>
<li>Bioshock</li>
<li>Mass Effect (1 and 2)
If I can hit the Squeenix games, so much the better</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MOAR SOCIALIZING</strong> - I spend far too much time at home surfing reddit when I could be doing fun things with other people (male and female). My thoughts are to join some organized sport (bowling league, for example) or finally show up to a meeting of that Japanese Language group  in town. Any way you look at it, I need to do more with people.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR DRAWING</strong> - Said it before, will say it again: I can never get better unless I just do it.</p>
<p>Well, there we are. Here&#39;s looking at a productive 2012. Right up until we all die on the 21st of December.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/best-of-anime-awards-finale">Best of Anime Awards - Finale</a></h2><time>December 31, 2011</time><div><p>Here we are at the final day of the year and our little anime awards show. So, here they are and we&#39;ll see you on the other side!</p>
<h2 id="best-show-of-2011">Best Show of 2011</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - Steins;Gate</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_steins_gate.jpg" alt="" title="Steins;Gate">
Time travel stories are amazing, and this is something I&#39;ve always known.  However, Steins Gate -- a show I started watching out of idle curiosity - has confirmed how badass I think they are.  Why is that, exactly?  Sit your ass down and I&#39;ll tell you.  </p>
<p>Like all good time travel stories, the show starts out all, &quot;Huh?&quot; then proceeds to, &quot;Ah!&quot; and ends on a &quot;I FUCKING UNDERSTAND <em>EVERYTHING</em> NOW.&quot;  You know what really helps these temporal feelings along?  A refreshing cast of badass and well developed characters -- surprisingly light on school girls -- teams up with the plot to create a story so badass that you will sit down on the stoop of your Manhattan apartment and think like a <em>GODDAMN MAN</em>.</p>
<p>Convinced yet?  Not enough info for your tastes?  TOUGH SHIT.  Absorb it through every orifice and be glad you did.[break]</p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Nichijou (My Ordinary Life)</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Nichijou">
Are you looking for a good time? Good, because Nichijou just saw your good time and raised it one shitload of what-the-hell-just-happened?. The title means &quot;ordinary life&quot;, but the show is anything but ordinary. Epic shoops whoop out of people&#39;s mouths, dogs go full retard, cats talk, and there are explosions which turn everything into big, smoking craters of completely unharmed. Yes, you read all of that correctly, and it is all accurate. &quot;Not a single fuck was given that day&quot; sums up this show perfectly, and I would have it no other way.</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Nichijou</strong>
There are a few somethings about Nichijou that separates it from nearly every other anime I&#39;ve watched. First of all is its gratuitous use of slapstick style visual humor. This is something that is present in most of my favorite Western cartoons (Dexter&#39;s Lab, SpongeBob, etc), probably due to the more serious/light-hearted/based in reality nature of most of the shows I&#39;ve watched. The scenarios that Nichijou presents are ridiculous in and of themselves, but its the timing, animation, and supremely awesome voice work takes the insane and makes it exponentially so. I posit the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teFFokJZ8go">following evidence</a> (Wadsworth&#39;s constant applies). Balancing out the insanity side of our equation are the cuteness overload portions of the show with the super intelligent five year-old Professor and her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqqGgSe6qfI">robot maternal figure</a>. Nichijou is pretty much everything I love about anime and Western cartoons rolled into one quite hilarious ball of awesome. It _is_ the complete package.</p>
<h2 id="best-show-watched-in-2011">Best Show Watched in 2011</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - Death Note</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_death_note.jpg" alt="" title="Death Note">
If Death Note came out this year, I would have a tough time deciding between it and Steins; Gate as the best 2011 show, but as it didn&#39;t, this is my way of splitting the highest award.</p>
<p>Death Note is, put simply, a real man&#39;s show.  Singularly focused on the intellectual battle of its main characters -- Light Yagami and L -- this show exudes cerebral juices that will MELT YOUR BRAIN.  If your brain doesn&#39;t melt, you likely didn&#39;t have one to begin with, eliminating your ability to enjoy this show -- a tragedy on a scale not seen since the sinking of the Titanic.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t seen Death Note, watch it now, then go out and buy me the DVDs -- you&#39;ll be glad you did at least one of these things.</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Death Note</strong>
Death Note is a show that one of my college buddies had been pestering me to watch for a really long time. Finally got around to it two years later and I&#39;m glad I finally did. The reason that had kept me away from the show turned out to be one of the most intriguing elements of it: the notebook that can kill anybody by simply writing their name in it (some rules apply). The moral questions raised are enough to ponder on their own merits; would one choose the way of Light Yagami, punishing those who break the law, or that of L who believes that there is no place in the world for any such device? Beyond this, the cat and mouse game played by super geniuses Light, who kills criminals under a psuedonym, and L, who is trying to uncover the identity of the criminal killer, is highly entertaining as you watch each of them calculating their next move to try and attain their goal. Unfortunately, the show did kind of peter out towards the latter half, but it was still an intellectual roller coaster of enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Death Note/Baccano!</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_baccano.jpg" alt="" title="Baccano!">
&quot;Death Note&quot;, or &quot;Baccano!&quot;. This is my quandary. Unfortunately for you, I&#39;m going to cop-out and say both. I can&#39;t choose. &quot;Baccano!&quot; is mystery story that takes place in 1930s United States where the Mafia rule the streets. Most of it even happens on a train. Alchemy is also involved, as well as immortal beings and crazy people who love to shoot guns. How do you go wrong with that? You can&#39;t, and they don&#39;t. &quot;Baccano!&quot; is also home to that lovable crazy couple, Isaac and Miria. If they were to make a show about these two characters alone, I would watch it.
&quot;Death Note&quot;, on the other hand, is a more cerebral experience, where you enjoy the characters and their actions simply by how well they think it all through. Two ultimate masterminds going at it, manipulating everyone around them to get what they want and undermine the other. Good times. What&#39;s more is that you don&#39;t want to see either side lose, because the characters are so great and likeable(UNLIKE SOME CHARACTERS I WILL TALK ABOUT LATER).
I could gush about these two shows all day, but I don&#39;t actually have that much time(that and spoilers). I&#39;ll just go on and say that both shows win the award and be done with it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and have a Happy New Year ^_^!</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/2011-dxprog-anime-awards-a-bit-of-character">2011 Best of Anime Awards - A Bit of Character</a></h2><time>December 30, 2011</time><div><p>Welcome back, and now for installment two of the 2011 Best of Anime Awards (<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-best-of-anime-awards" target="_blank">Part 1, if you missed it</a>).</p>
<h4>Best Character</h4>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Chris - Rintarou Okabe (<em>Steins;Gate</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_okarin.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>Rintarou Okabe -- aka, mad scientist Hououin Kyouma -- is the main element that makes Steins; Gate amazing.</p>
<p>Okabe starts off over the top, telling everybody he&#39;s a mad scientist and making grand claims about a secret organization that&#39;s keeping tabs on him.  Over the course of the show, however, you see him develop into a very troubled character as the show&#39;s events begin to take their toll on him.  This depth later on really makes you feel for him as a character.</p>
<p>But you know what the best part is?  He&#39;s an ass most of the time, but in a good way, asserting himself over his supposed suboordinates in an over the top fashion.</p>
<p>Gotta love it.</p>
</div>[break]
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Jeff - Graham Spector (<em>Baccano!</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_wrench_guy.jpg" alt="Wrench Guy" />
</p>
<p>Initially, I was going to give this to some character in &quot;Nichijou&quot;, but then I remembered about Wild Tiger, also known as Kotetsu Kaburagi, from &quot;Tiger and Bunny&quot;. Overall, I just think he&#39;s a cool guy. He&#39;s kind of a blundering idiot with a tendency to be overdestructive in his hero efforts, but his heart is in the right place and it shows in how he interacts with the other heroes... And I would be saying that had I not suddenly remembered about the Graham Specter(affectionately called &quot;Wrench Guy&quot; from here out) near the end of &quot;Baccano!&quot;. Seriously, that guy is awesome. He&#39;s spastic, overly talkative, philosophical, mostly harmless, and a prankster. I am saddened by the fact that he showed up only once. Still, his performance was completely solid and I love it. The award goes to Wrench Guy.</p>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Matt - L and Light Yagami (<em>Death Note</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_l_light.jpg" alt="L and Light" />
</p>
<p>I will admit, I&#39;m kind of bending the rules a tad here by including two characters, but it&#39;s one of those times where neither can really stand on their own merits. On the one hand, you&#39;ve got an eccentric, crime fighting super genius who has a penchant for sweets and odd posture, on the other, an outward goody-two-shoes but secretly maniacal sociopath who is using <em>his</em> super genius to rid the world of petty crime. These two and how they&#39;re constantly pitting their wit against each other is the driving force of Death Note and one of the best character combos I&#39;ve seen in recent history (though, I&#39;m sure Captain Haddock and Tintin will be quite awesome).</p>
</div>
<h4>Worst Character (and why I want to kill them)</h4>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Chris - Mello (<em>Death Note</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_mellow.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit that Mello isn&#39;t a terrible character, but he&#39;s arguably the cause behind a handful of misteps about two thirds through Death Note, and it&#39;s largely due to his personality type.</p>
<p>Death Note -- as a matter of necessity -- is dominated by a cast of intelligent and calculating characters.  Mello has very little of these traits, instead being largely driven by kneejerk emotional reactions which don&#39;t fit amidst the company of Light or L.  Placed amongst the cast of a more traditional Shounen series, Mellow would fit right in, he&#39;s just not the right fit here.</p>
<p>Also, his character design makes him look like a pansy ass mofo.</p>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Jeff - A Whole Bunch of People from <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em></strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_ohana.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>That stupid bitch in Hanasaku Iroha with the black hair. I don&#39;t remember her name<em>, and I don&#39;t want to, but she&#39;s the one who&#39;s always telling Ohana to die, or some shit like that. That bitch is a complete, unsociable c**</em> who deserves the worst imaginable death for her treatment of Ohana(the only likeable character in that show). Allow me to be the one to fus-ro-DAH! her off the edge of a cliff and into Oblivion, where Mehrunes Dagon will enslave her for eternity!</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;m not going to leave it at that, for there are others who deserve my wrath. Ohana&#39;s mother is the second of those who have earned a death warrant, and is guilty of asshole level treatment of her own daughter. Making Ohana do the cooking from an early age, dropping her off at her evil grandmother&#39;s hotel, and finally running off to get married to some douchebag she never told Ohana about. Then she has the gall to back out of the marriage and not retrieve her daughter. What the fuck? Seriously? Ohana would be better off with a serial rapist with no interest in women under age twenty!</p>
<p>Ohana&#39;s grandmother is a nasty old hag, too. Outside of black-hair-bitch, she&#39;s the worst offender in the give-Ohana-shit-for-no-fucking-reason catagory. From day one, she didn&#39;t give two shits about her grandaughter and acted like they weren&#39;t even related. I don&#39;t care if this is Japan, I wouldn&#39;t even care if this bitch was the queen of fucking England, you do NOT treat family in such a piss poor manner(unless said member was deserving of it, which Ohana wasn&#39;t). I suppose she mellowed a teeny, tiny, infintesimal bit, but that does nothing to repair the damage she&#39;s done to Ohana.</p>
<p>Now that i think of it, I don&#39;t even know how this show even got going. It&#39;s about a bunch of people who don&#39;t give two fucks about anyone except themselves(Ohana being the exception to this) and expect Ohana to do all of the fucking work. Then they treat her like she&#39;s trash and wonder &quot;Why the fuck did she do that?&quot; when it&#39;s COMPLETELY FUCKING OBVIOUS. If I had been in Ohana&#39;s place, those douchecakes wouldn&#39;t have lasted the first fucking night. All of them would have woken the next morning to find themselves in Hell with big gashes on their necks. Then they would&#39;ve proceeded to ignore the fact that I did it and blame Ohana.</p>
<p>And don&#39;t even get me fucking started on this idea that some people purposely avoid getting into relationships with a guy so that they can let a friend, or some other jackoff get them first. That. Does. Not. Fucking. Happen.</p>
<p>Wait, that was Toradora...</p>
<p>Gawd, DAMN IT!</p>
<p><em>* - Matt&#39;s note - her name was Minko</em></p>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Matt - Kate Austen (<em>LOST</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_kate.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>There are no characters I can really think of for this spot. Mellow and Near nearly (heh) ruined Death Note, but I don&#39;t not wish death on either, necessarily. So, instead, I will take from another show I finished watching this year and name Kate Austen from LOST as the character I love to hate. She&#39;s such a wishy washy bitch through out the entire show, supporting whichever male character is proving to have the biggest balls (these being Jack and Sawyer). She can&#39;t make up her own goddamn mind and is constantly ruining things for everybody on both sides. I would have voted her off the island and sentenced her to death by smoke monster somewhere in the fourth season. The only thing she has going for her is that she&#39;s hot (but not as hot as Sun or Claire...)</p>
</div>
<p>Well, that wraps today&#39;s installment. Check back again tomorrow as we bring things to a close with the big awards ^_^</p></div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/2011-best-of-anime-awards">2011 Best of Anime Awards</a></h2><time>December 28, 2011</time><div><p>It&#39;s that time of year again. That is, the end of the year and the beginning of another. As has become a normal thing for my website, I am here doing reviews of anime series I watched during the year. However, I will be changing it up a bit and instead of reviewing everything, things will be done in a categorized award fashion. Joining me again this year are my brothers Jeff and Chris. So, without further ado, let&#39;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="why-the-hell-did-i-watch-that-">Why the Hell did I Watch That?</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_wings.jpg" alt="" title="We Without Wings">
<strong>Chris - First half of the first episode of We Without Wings</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I watched the first episode of this show because I wanted to see some mad panty shots.  What did I get?  An initial two minutes of fan service that made _me_ uncomfortable, followed by ten minutes of a couple of dick weeds in a bar having a boring ass conversation.</p>
<p>I will never get those twelve minutes of my life back.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_astarotte.jpg" alt="" title="Astarotte&#39;s Toy"></p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Astarotte&#39;s Toy</strong>
&quot;Astarotte&#39;s Toy&quot;, though it could be called &quot;Ass-tarotte&#39;s Toy&quot; for all the ass shots in the show. This anime has some major issues, and I&#39;m not just talking about the appeal to pedophiles.</p>
<p>The first issue is the mention in the beginning of how a succubus can pass on in full its genetic traits to its offspring, regardless of the father&#39;s race with 100% transference. If you&#39;re a male orc, and you have a child with a succubus, your child will be a succubus(don&#39;t ask me where incubi come from, because I don&#39;t know). I would take this furthur, but we&#39;ll table it for now and elaborate later. The next issue is a bit more dire. The main character, Naoya Tohara, has a daughter, Asuha Tohara. This daughter&#39;s mother is a succubus; the same succubus that gave birth to Princess Astarotte. This makes Astarotte Asuha&#39;s half-sister. Got all that? Good. Now, why in the hell is Naoya falling in love with his daughter&#39;s ten year old half sister? Asuha is at most a single year younger than Astarotte. What are the ethical implications of this outside of pedophilia? Did I mention that the queen succubus who Naoya banged to create Ashua is completely all right with it? This family is fucked up for real.</p>
<p>And now that thing I said I was going to elaborate on: Why is Asuha a normal human not a frikkin&#39; succubus? Another question not answered is what do incubi eat to survive? Too many questions, too many disturbing facts, and too much pandering to pedophiles...</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Astarotte&#39;s Toy</strong>
I actually have a handful of shows that could fit in this category, but I too must choose Astarotte&#39;s Toy. This show is so close to lolicon it&#39;s not even funny. The two main females of the show (who are supposed to be ten, btw) are either wearing skimpy clothing or think it&#39;s fun to go commando. And not to mention the <em>ahem</em> &quot;life seed&quot; that&#39;s supposed to sustain our titular character since she&#39;s a succubus (the former of the aforementioned girls). I swear to god I&#39;m not a pedophile, but I could not tell you why I watched this show in its entirety.</p>
<p>Oh, and there&#39;s a milk maid. But she doesn&#39;t get her milk from cows... her cow shaped ears and actions tell us that she _is_ the cow...</p>
<h2 id="best-opening-song">Best Opening Song</h2>

<p>[b)Matt - Shoujo Q (<em>Pani Poni Dash</em>)[/b]

I&#39;d considered choosing Madoka Magica&#39;s [Connect/0.jpg" alt="youtube video">](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQbaJquz_jo]">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQbaJquz_jo]</a>

What bumps Shojou Q above is how the song is drippy with 80s goodness, from the synth stabs to the wire frames littered throughout the opening animation. This really fits in well with Pani Poni&#39;s pop culture referential, super random craziness.</p>
<h2 id="best-ending-song">Best Ending Song</h2>

[![youtube video](<a href="https://img.youtube.com/vi/mKQ2DCMC0JM]">https://img.youtube.com/vi/mKQ2DCMC0JM]</a>
This song was used as the ending in one episode of Steins; Gate, but that&#39; enough to grab the award from me.  As with my choice of best opening, I have listened to this song <em>one zillion jillion times</em>.  Not possible?  This song makes it possible through pure badassery.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Ahita, boku wa kimi ni ai ni wuku</strong>
[youtube=3xIM-JnIB8s]
As for best ending? It comes from a show I didn&#39;t even watch, which I will not name. The name of the song is &quot;Ahita, boku wa kimi ni ai ni wuku&quot;. Again, it is impossible for me to validate this decision with words. My taste in music is largely arbitrary, so again go listen to the song if you want to know why I chose it.
I make no guarantees that you will like either of them.</p>

The ender for AnoHana is actually a cover of a JPOP song from the turn of the century, but this version seems to kick the original&#39;s ass. I think part of this is due to this version being played slightly softer which really helps it punctuate the end of every episode of the show (which, arguably, ended with a lot of downers).</p>

Unfortunately, due to the design of my music listening system, my living room stereo is controllable from anywhere, hence this was made possible.</p>

<p>Best $0.99 I&#39;ve ever spent on a karaoke song.</p>
