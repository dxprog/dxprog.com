Hi. Long time since I last wrote an entry. I&#39;ve come aways in QB. I have a program that will load .gif files in QB. I also have a program that will make gifs. gotta go bye!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I distinctly remember when I discovered the ability to load external graphics into my QBasic programs; it was something quite magical. Why I didn&#39;t go with Windows bitmaps as my format of choice, I don&#39;t know (super simple files to read), but what&#39;s interesting is that &quot;program that will makes gifs&quot; was none other than the original PSP - Paint Shop Pro. This was my first real interaction with a real graphics program and yet another piece of the puzzle that got me where I am today.</p>

<p>Eighth entry
July 2, 2000
Good news. I OWN VBASIC!!! I also own ROGUE SQUADRON! And IT&#39;S a girl!!!!! I also have a web page. Dan is going to mail me Turbo C++ with compiler. We have made a music album. We also have web again. [statement redacted] Leah e-mails me quite often. Well I have to go. Bye!</p>

<p>For my fourteenth birthday, my parents got me a (gimped) version of Visual Basic 6 that I had been eyeing at our local staples for months. I know for a fact that there&#39;s a picture of me cradling it with a dreamy look in my eyes hanging around somewhere (hint hint, mom). I also got a bitchin&#39; shark pillow that year (which I appropriately named &quot;Sharkey&quot;). Sadly, Sharkey is no longer with us and spends his days chilling underneath a mountain of trash somewhere west of Bartlesville.</p>
<p>Another interesting bit: the &quot;web&quot; of which I refer to was Juno, a free provider that had the most annoying ad window thingy. But, hey. Free internet without all the restrictions that the AOL software brought to it (no internet for other programs).</p>
<p>It was a simpler time.</p>

<p>Fifth Entry
Jan 30, 2000
Well VB5 is out of the question. The Damn software doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve almost made it through Ando Prime on E1R (Episode I Racer). That&#39;s right I&#39;ve been playing it. I&#39;ve been listening to my CD player like crazy. We&#39;ve had alot of snow lately. I made a fort for me and the other two (i.e. Jeff, Chris). We&#39;ve had several fights over the last few days. The first one I annilated their for. Well gotta go. Tottles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the record, &quot;tottles&quot; was not a typo during transcribing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sixth Entry
Feb 14, 2000
Well This is going to be a big entry. We figured out how to get Ep 1 Racer working. You have to have Sonic &amp; Knuckles in the background. I&#39;m going to make FF (first fantasy). It&#39;s going to be 3D. Anyways, the big news is mom&#39;s pregnant again. Tootles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor Maggie (the aforementioned fetus). The announcement of her coming into being is overshadowed by the details of how we got around a particularly annoying issue in Episode I Racer. I guess by the time sibling number five rolls around, the whole idea just kind of lost its charm. That, and at the time of this writing Maggie could very well have been brother number five.</p>
<p>Also, why is it I abbreviated Episode I Racer that one time (and then bothered to spell it out later)? And why can I spell &quot;tootles&quot; correct one week, but not another? And what is Damn software?</p>
<p>The world may never know.</p>

Something that makes me laugh a pained laugh.</p>

<p>Third Entry</p>
<p>Thursday, Jan 13, 2000</p>
<p>Well Jeff is finishing his Zelda books. I have new VBasic classes. As soon as I can get it working. Oh well thats all for now.</p>

<p>Fourth Entry</p>
<p>Jan 19, 2000</p>
<p>Hello. I heard from Leah yesterday. Boy did she get alot of stuff for Christmas. She obviously has a computer. Her letter was printed. By accident I found out mom&#39;s e-mail address. It&#39;s [redacted]@hotmail.com. Kinda neat! So I e-mailed her today and I&#39;M ALIVE!!! I have officially finished Excel! I made a cards program. Next is VB 5 and then DIRECTX. Thats right it&#39;s a LANGUAGE. So I will climb in the world. I&#39;ll be a top programmer at 15. Anyways gotta run. Bye!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ll gloss over my erroneous comments about DirectX being a language or the fact that knowing my mother&#39;s email address at the time would&#39;ve meant certain death, and skip to the single most awesome thing I&#39;ve read in all these journal entries thus far; the bold delcaration of having &quot;officially finished Excel&quot;.</p>
<p>How does one &quot;finish&quot; Excel? Does it involve an end boss fight with pivot tables and a cell formula with many functions? Who declared this &quot;finishing&quot; official? It&#39;s true that my Excel VBA skills exceed that of your standard user (in large part because of my father), but this declaration just doesn&#39;t hold any kind of matter.</p>
<p>But, let&#39;s face it; I was also under the delusion that programming in VB and DirectX was going to make me a &quot;top programmer&quot;, and at fifteen, no less.</p>
