NOT! Somehow, and I've yet been able to figure out why, my password got reset. Now I figure it's one of four scenerios:

**A)** A little kid somehow changed the password by pounding on my keyboard
**B)** One of our neighbors has been sitting cracking our WPA passkey the last month (and I think that all of our neighbors have WiFi)
**C)** Some Uber h4x0r who's peed off at me snuck in via the internet and changed it hoping to make my life miserable
**D)** My SAM file got corrupted

D is the most likely scenerio, but you can't discount any of the others. Anyhoo, I spent most of yesterday figuring out how to undo it without reinstalling Windows. My first thought was to try the Linux distro [austrumi](http://cyti.latgola.lv/ruuni/index_en.html) which has a utility called nt_pass (only in version 0.9.2, btw). Well, that didn't want to work because, gosh, my SAM file is read-only. Well what jerk wrote _that_ program? :-P

So, I went and did some more searching and came across a little hole in the Windows Istaller. Here's how it works:

**A)** You'll need a Windows XP/2003 CD (any flavor: plain, SP1 or SP2) that's bootable (I 'spect most have this kind)
**B)** Boot with that and get to the point where you can repair a Windows install (Enter, Enter, F8, R I believe is the key sequence)
**C)** Just go along with that. Your computer will reboot and start the second half of the install.
**D)** Be paying atention to the progress bar in the lower left of the screen. When I says "Install Devices" hit F10. You'll be greeted by a command prompt which will allow you to do darn near anything you want.
**E)** In this particular case run the command "control userpasswords2" and a friendly box will come up where you can reset passwords, add users, etc.
**F)** Once you've done whatever it is you're going to do let Windows finish installing or you'll lose everything you just did.

Needless to say that I created myself a new user account so I could leave the Aministrator one alone ('tis one of the drawbacks to 2K3. You have to go using the command prompt just to get to a place to add a user :-P). But now I'm back in business and everything works great. I hope somebody out there finds that useful because it sure was to me.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/dxprog-the-wage-slave">dxprog the wage slave</a></h1><time class="post__published">October 27, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Well, I made it past my interview (I&#39;d like to say with flying colors). I may as well say I&#39;ve got a job (I have no doubt in my mind that I&#39;ll pass the drug/alcohol test). In fact, before taking the test today (yuck) I overheard the people in the back talking about how I was &quot;the only one today&quot; and that Wal-mart hasn&#39;t been &quot;getting any applications&quot;. They&#39;re deperate. They need me.</p>
<p>No updates on Ramboella as I can&#39;t find my darn Office CD key back (had it just last week :-P). I may mooch off my parents copy of 2K3 Pro (it is nicer) but I&#39;m going to have to do something and soon if I&#39;m going to be on the job 5+ hours a day.</p>

I should be able to finish the script this week and start shooting next week. So keep coming back for updates.</p>
<p>Also, and this is the big news, but it looks like I may have a job pretty soon (as in an actual job). Last night I applied at Wal-Mart and I&#39;m already setup for an interview tomorrow.

<p>Well, it was nice to have something to post for a change (and good news at that). Just remember to keep your RSS reader up-to-date or check back for more information on... Ramboella!</p>
