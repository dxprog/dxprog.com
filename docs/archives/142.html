I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all thinking because we&#39;re moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).</p>
<p>But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It&#39;s not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.</p>
<p>Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I&#39;m in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game <a href="http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test">here.</a></p>
<p>I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I&#39;m not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let&#39;s face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I&#39;m sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you&#39;re interested in helping check out the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a>.</p>

The showing last night went incredibly well, apparently. So well, in fact, that the guy is going to be getting his financing in order within the next day or so. So that means I will be <strong>movingprog!!</strong></p>
<p>In other news, Steve&#39;s Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It&#39;ll be nice to have something to play again.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)</p>

Tryblithe, owner of <a href="http://www.ctsquare.net">CT Square</a> web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it&#39;s all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it&#39;s much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that&#39;s pretty cool :-)</p>
<p>Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that&#39;s about all there is to report there.</p>
<p>Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That&#39;s right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought &quot;Hey, this looks kind of cool&quot;. But I&#39;ve been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is &quot;We&#39;re coming soon!&quot;, &quot;Almost there...&quot;, &quot;blah blah blah...&quot;. One of their so called &quot;storez&quot; was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here&#39;s is Amazon&#39;s reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
web site.  </p>
<p>Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
their site.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, real legit :-P.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)</p>

<p>Firstly, my Empire game is coming along nicely. I spent most of the afternoon and part of this evening getting the random map generation working. That was a blast :-D. Tomorrow I will actually start building the engine framework. This is the part where I generally choke, but I feel pretty motivated :-). I&#39;ve never really done anything to this degree (and this clean) in C++.</p>
<p>Secondly, I got to evict a wasp nest hanging up in one of the windows. It was kind of cool (and scary). Luckily, we&#39;ve got some nasty spray that kills on contact. A couple of spritzes upwards and it started raining wasps. One tried to retaliate, but then it died ;-).</p>
<p>Thirdly, somebody is coming to see the house tomorrow morning (day 6 on the market, about day 4 for actually having the sign up). So that means more cleaning and evacuation and since school starts locally tomorrow we&#39;re going to be the odd ones out. Figures :-P. But, all in all, I don&#39;t really mind. The more people who look at the house the greater our odds of selling the thing.</p>
<p>It kind of bums me out that Twilight Princess isn&#39;t coming out until next year, but that gives me more time to come up with money ;-). Actually, I seem to have found a direction for me to go. Sometime this year I&#39;ll take the GED and then just spend from then until fall of next year, when I&#39;ll go to a local college to get ready for DigiPen, on a job and saving money. It&#39;s the clearest direction on where to take life I&#39;ve had in a long time.</p>
<p>Well, that was kind of long winded for a change :-P. Before I leave, however, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to Slazer for reading my blog. You&#39;re a cool dude, Slazer ;-). See ya!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/tetra-a-thing-of-the-past">Tetra a thing of the past?</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 15, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Yeah, seems like a crazy proposition considering how much time and effort I&#39;ve stuffed into it, but I may be moving on to something new. I&#39;ve been seeing a lot about Ajax, some fancy JScript/XML stuff that basically eliminates page loading, and I may take a shot at basing my new engine around this. Of course, it&#39;s just an idea at the moment.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;ve been starting a new game. It&#39;ll basically be a Windows version of the old strategy game, Empire. I&#39;ve been messing around with D3D8 the last couple days and I finally got all the rendering stuff done this morning (yay!).</p>
<p>In the land of house-stuffs, somebody else is coming to see the place tomorrow. We don&#39;t know the details because Dad couldn&#39;t catch much of the call (due to noisy little kids). Something about they&#39;ll call again, they&#39;re from California, blah blah blah. So we&#39;ll have to vacate again, but if it means we get that house we&#39;ve bid on, who cares :-).</p>
