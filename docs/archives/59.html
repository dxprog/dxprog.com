It was terrible, but I found myself reading through it again one day not too long ago for whatever reason. One comic in particular intrigued me as I was attempting to <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54170/anime-tracy/">take a stab</a> at &quot;anime style&quot;, an in joke to a couple of sudden character design changes I&#39;d made. Here is the panel in question:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Kate2006.jpg" alt="" title="Kate circa 2006"></p>
<p>Now, one thing that intrigues me about this picture is that, at the time, I absolutely despised anime and all arts Japanese. That being said, I do not remember using much of anything as far as reference to even attempt to match the style. Just slap on some large, shiny eyes and a pleated skirt. DONE!</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to revisit this frame and, given that I am actually attempting to draw in this style seriously, envision it as it should have been.

This is something I do, on average, every 6-8 months or more (I didn&#39;t really bother to calculate the actual average). Looking through my past profile pics on Facebook, I noticed something interesting: they convey a visual history of my beard. My beard is certainly deserving of its own blog post, so I will regale its tale here for the masses!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007a.jpg" alt="" title="Circa April 2007">
<strong>April 2007</strong> - A couple of straggling hairs, but otherwise nothing. My hand does not deserve to be stroking a smooth chin.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007b.jpg" alt="" title="Circa May 2007">
<strong>May 2007</strong> - At this point, there&#39;s enough hairs that I could probably have cosplayed as <a href="http://aceattorney.wikia.com/wiki/Gumshoe">Detective Gumshoe</a> quite easily.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007c.jpg" alt="" title="Circa October 2007">
<strong>October 2007</strong> - Okay, let&#39;s face it. 2007 was a crappy year for the beard.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2008.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2008">
<strong>October 2008</strong> - While certainly not filled out, the beard was finally showing some promise of being EPIC. Interesting side note - I had to Photoshop that smirk onto my face</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2009.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2009">
<strong>May 2009</strong> - Two years later, the beard is finally respectable enough that it can be stroked in deep thought and look awesome.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2010.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2010">
<strong>October 2010</strong> - After 24 years of beard growing, I think it&#39;s finally gotten to the &quot;You don&#39;t want to fuck with me&quot; status. The shades help.</p>
<p>Some other interesting things to notice in these pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>My face is almost always pointed away from the camera</li>
<li>I get fatter as time goes on</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you see (and I am NOT making this up) OCTOSHARK on SCI-FI last night.  I mean the (so called) special effects were anything but!  You with a crayon and a piece of paper drawing the title creature could have made a scarier one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m never one to turn down a challenge like that, so I give you the terror of the deep, Sharktopus!</p>

<p>Trailer for the horror in question can be seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2HGoR8pSps&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">here</a>.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/wordpress-related-posts-script">Wordpress - Related Posts Script</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 13, 2010</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>At my job, I currently have three Wordpress sites under my watchful eye. On one, I was tasked with creating a related posts feature. Now, there are certainly enough plug-ins that will do just that, but none of them worked how I wanted to or were generally more complex than necessary. So, I whipped up this little script:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">function relatedPosts($id) {

    /* Build a query to get a list of all posts that share similar tags */
    $s = microtime(true);
    $q = &quot;SELECT count(*) AS total, p.ID, p.post_title, p.post_date FROM wp_posts p INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships t ON p.ID=t.object_id AND t.term_taxonomy_id in (SELECT s.term_taxonomy_id FROM wp_term_relationships s WHERE s.object_id=$id) AND t.object_id != $id AND p.post_status=&#39;publish&#39; GROUP BY p.id ORDER BY total DESC, p.post_date DESC LIMIT 5&quot;;

    /* Format the output */
    $out = &quot;&quot;;
    $result = @mysql_query($q);
    if ($result &amp;&amp; @mysql_num_rows($result) &gt; 0) {
        $out = &quot;&lt;h3 class=\&quot;related\&quot;&gt;Related Posts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\&quot;related\&quot;&gt;&quot;;
        while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)) {
            $perma = get_permalink($row-&gt;ID);
            $out .= &#39;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39;.$perma.&#39;&quot;&gt;&#39;.$row-&gt;post_title.&#39;&lt;/a&gt; - &#39;.date(&quot;F j, Y&quot;, strtotime($row-&gt;post_date)).&#39;&lt;/li&gt;&#39;;
        }
        $out .= &quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;;
    }

    echo($out);

}
</code></pre>
<p>Just drop that in the wp-content/<em>yourtheme</em>/functions.php file, where <em>yourtheme</em> is the directory of your active theme. Then add the following in your wp-content/<em>yourtheme</em>/single.php where you want the related posts to appear:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">relatedPosts(get_the_ID());
</code></pre>
<p>You should now have a list of posts with similar tags. Styling is simple: one h3 and one ul, both with the class &quot;related&quot;.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
