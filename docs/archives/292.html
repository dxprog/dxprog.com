I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all thinking because we&#39;re moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).</p>
<p>But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It&#39;s not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.</p>
<p>Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I&#39;m in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game <a href="http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test">here.</a></p>
<p>I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I&#39;m not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let&#39;s face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I&#39;m sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you&#39;re interested in helping check out the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The ship is about to hit the fan</h2><time>August 24, 2005</time><div><p>Got a call this morning from our realtor. The showing last night went incredibly well, apparently. So well, in fact, that the guy is going to be getting his financing in order within the next day or so. So that means I will be <strong>movingprog!!</strong></p>
<p>In other news, Steve&#39;s Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It&#39;ll be nice to have something to play again.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)</p>
