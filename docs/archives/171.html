This time I&#39;m doin&#39; Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the <strong>best</strong> artwork I&#39;ve ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are <strong>FIVE</strong> fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn&#39;t entirely faithful to the <a href="http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg">source material</a>, but I&#39;m really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin&#39; awesome.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m pretty pleased with it. It&#39;s a far sight better than the original pencil art I had. However, the top part of the body seems to be a bit too small compared to everythiong else. But, considering I don&#39;t draw girls very often I&#39;ll give myself a break. I suppose it&#39;s one of those things I&#39;ll need to work on eventually.</p>
<p>This whole mess of pictures actually comes from one piece of art I&#39;d drawn a while back for a comic (the point of which now escapes me). I&#39;ve enjoyed being able to make purty art again and I may keep it up just to keep me busy until September.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#39;ve begun searching for a roommate. I&#39;ve e-mailed a couple guys now and I hope to hear back from some one. Also, I&#39;m pretty darn sure that I&#39;ll be adding animation as a second degree. Drawing these pictres has really hit home that, hey, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bad of an artist and, most importantly, I had a hell of a time doing it. So I&#39;ll need to e-mail them and see how much it&#39;ll cost me to tack that on. That&#39;d also mean spending twice as long at school, but it&#39;s so freakin&#39; cool that&#39;s hardly a problem ;-).</p>
