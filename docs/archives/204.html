As such I have set up a little exercise for myself: select a theme each week and do a drawing every day. This week&#39;s theme, as the title suggests, is Zelda. Specifically, Twilight Princess. So I bring you my first &quot;masterpeice&quot;:</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not terribly thrilled with this. All I can say is I can&#39;t wait to get my Mac Book Pro from the school loaded with Photoshop so I can use tools I&#39;m already familiar with. My Prismas are nice, but they lack an undo function.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Teh Arts</h2><time>July 15, 2007</time><div><p>Last couple days I decided to actually DO something and crack out my Prismas and create beautiful masterpiec es that will be remembered long after I die. Or something.</p>

Some kid and a frog off the cover of a book my little brothers and sisters got from the library. I was originally just going to draw the kid (which I only drew because that&#39;s what was in front of my face), but the crowd that had gathered around me started chanting for the frog. So I drew the frog. Whatever.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for some more awesome stuff. Awesome stuff that isn&#39;t wierd kids and flying frogs.</p>
