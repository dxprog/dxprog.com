I suppose I can just ramble.</p>
<p>My Wal-Mart experiences of late have not been of the highest caliber. Granted, one doesn&#39;t usually expect world class service at the World of Walls, but this has been exceedingly blah. Cashiers who just don&#39;t give a shit, seem to be high out of their mind or cannot comprehend the English language are what greet me at my new Wal-Mart. Though, I just left my old one, full of good people whom I mostly know, after having gotten the worst cashier yet.</p>
<p>I was there to pick up the new Weird Al album (which was not in the new releases as it should have been) and made a bee line to express lane with the shortest queue. The cashier, some teenager named Jace, was trying to open his drawer, an action that locks up the register until a CSM has approved it from their keypad. Problem number one - you don&#39;t lock up your register when there are customers waiting and you don&#39;t have to. He then proceeded to get exceedingly pissed off, swearing and smashing the clear button on his keyboard. He was honestly becoming quite violent.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand his frustration with slow CSM response and the slowness to back out of an action on the aging registers. I&#39;ve been on both sides of of that equation. However, he did unessecarily bring it upon himself and his display of frustration was absolutely not professional.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I guess this post became a rant about my Wal-Mart experience, but it still counts.</p>

Today, I am going to pass on my tried and true formula to you, my adoring Internet audience.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step1.jpg" alt="" title="The human slice-n-dice, I am">
Chop some onion, celery and carrots. This is known in the culinary world as <em>mirepoix</em>.</p>
<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step2.jpg" alt="" title="Much sizzling happens here">
Saute your <em>mirepoix</em> in some olive oil along with spices and other things.</p>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step3.jpg" alt="" title="MAGIC!">
Apply a healthy dose of magic. This step is critical and you mustn&#39;t get it wrong lest you create a hideous food beast.</p>
<h2 id="step-4">Step 4</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step4.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s good enough to each, which is good. It is food, after all.">
Enjoy over some thin spaghetti. Not that fat stuff. Ideally, you&#39;d also have Parmesan cheese, though I sadly did not for this instance.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now can make your own BFSS to woo over whomever you please!</p>

This got me to realizing that I&#39;ve coded this particular game to some varying level to completion five times now, six if you include the yet to be written iPad version.</p>
<p>Six times. And now you&#39;ll get the code for a good many of those.</p>

My first shot for a TAttack clone didn&#39;t make it too far. It was little more of a see-if-I-could attempt. Written in Visual Basic and using GDI for graphics, there&#39;s not much to see here except how terrible it is.

But, whatever.</p>

<p>Download: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/ColorClock.zip">Source</a></p>
<p>Some time ago, a coworker passed along a link to this very nifty <a href="http://thecolourclock.co.uk/">Colour Clock</a> which displays the time and uses the values of said time to drive the background color. It&#39;s really quite pretty and nifty. Back when he linked me, there was the flash version on the site and a download for an OS X screen saver. No Windows love.</p>
<p>So, I fired up my copy of Visual Studio and set about correcting this sadness. I never really polished it to the extent I wanted, which is why I&#39;m putting it up as a source code release. There is a binary in there, but no installer or anything.</p>
<p>Also, before I created this version, I also conjured up a JavaScript one as well, which you can see <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/color_clock.html">here</a>.</p>

On the whole, I&#39;m not doing terrible. I&#39;m exercising more, I&#39;ve gotten an apartment and I promptly gave up in Final Fantasy X-2, a decision we all agree is better for my sanity. On the art front, however, things are less than stellar; I can probably count on two hands the amount of times I&#39;ve set pencil to paper to do anything. I blame it all on this one piece I&#39;ve bee &quot;working on&quot; since February.</p>
<p>After I completed that <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/dddoll-beam/">one commission</a>, I got another one similar only it involved multiple characters from a source I&#39;m not familiar with. But, in the spirit of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ganbare"><em>ganbare</em></a>, I gave it a shot. And now, four months later, it&#39;s stuck in development hell somewhere between the coloring and shading phase:</p>

<p>These are the first and last of what is supposed to be four panels. I like the last one there, not so keen on the first and am less so of the one&#39;s in between (which is why they&#39;ve not been colored yet.</p>
<p>All this said, I hereby change my New Year&#39;s resolution of draw more to &quot;finish this goddamn piece before the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Even I am unsure of whether I can keep it...</p>
