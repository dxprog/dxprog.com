<h2 id="biggest-surprise">Biggest Surprise</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qrZZgaW.jpg" alt="" title="Flowers of Evil">
<strong>Chris - <em>Flowers of Evil</em></strong></p>
<p>This was a weird one. Initially, I made an attempt to watch the first episode because I wanted to see what was up with the art style. I was pretty revolted and didn’t get much farther than a few minutes in, determining then that I would never pick the series back up. However, as the season progressed, and good reviews for the series - at least from American outlets - began rolling in, I gave the show a second shot. And so it was that I marathoned the show over the course of two days. Fuck me, man.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t realize on my first attempt was how good the story was, as I hadn&#39;t seen enough due to the art style turning me off. But as I progressed through the series, even the visuals began to grow on me, and not because I found them attractive, per se, but because they work so goddamn well for the story being told. They provide a perfect, unsettling feel that works with the story, music, and direction to make you uncomfortable, and that’s how the show ended up being so effective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, chances of a second season are pretty much non-existent, which saddens me given the open ending and the tease in the last episode showing moments from farther along in the manga. But in any case, I’m glad I gave this show a chance.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o40rHvb.jpg" alt="" title="Girls und Panzer">
<strong>Matt - <em>Girls und Panzer</em></strong></p>
<p>In a genre filled with &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; shows, I would have expected Girls und Panzer, a series centering around - surprise, surprise - high school girls who drive and battle tanks, to be more of the same. And while there is plenty of pandering in that area, the show seems to concentrate more on the tank battles and the tactics around them instead of the girls&#39; antics. For the silly ass plot, it&#39;s surprisingly engaging without being dull or saccharine sweet. The suspension of disbelief becomes a little difficult when there are live ammunition rounds flying everywhere, tanks flipping, and lots of explosions without any of the characters getting a scratch, but it&#39;s a wholly enjoyable romp. I mean, c&#39;mon. You have to give credit to any show making such a blatant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qF51ApP5PA">homage to the Spam sketch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-letdown">Biggest Letdown</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hsl22ww.jpg" alt="" title="Henneko">
<strong>Chris - <em>The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat</em></strong>
I’m not gonna lie, I enjoyed Henneko. It was sometimes funny and occasionally touching, but I still can&#39;t contain my raging disappointment with certain parts of the show.</p>
<p>For starters, Kantoku&#39;s character designs didn&#39;t translate as well to the Anime as I was hoping. I&#39;m chalking this up to JC Staff, a studio I’m pretty consistently disappointed with in terms of production values, but that&#39;s a rant for another day.</p>
<p>Another problem I have is with main girl Tsukiko. I think Tsukiko is okay, but she’s not great - or at least she isn’t past the first episode. It&#39;s at first funny and a little charming when Tsukiko loses her ability to emote, but it gets old fast, and I kept wishing that at some point she would regain this ability. As it was, I was treated to 11 episodes about a cadaver with speaking abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s the issue of best girl, Azuki Azusa, and how you know she&#39;s going to get shafted in the game of love, overtaken by an almost literal piece of cardboard, much the same way that Kanna Tanigawa from Ano Natsu de Matteru got her heart gutted by a figurative piece of cardboard last year.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;m still bitter over that one.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hBHkxUl.jpg" alt="" title="Oreimo 2">
<strong>Matt - <em>My Little Sister Can&#39;t Be This Cute (Season 2 OVAs)</em></strong>
I suppose in a show entitled &quot;My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute&quot; I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that they ended it how they did. However, I was lead to believe that this show was going to eschew the images suggested by the title and simply be about a couple of estranged siblings making amends and the journey to get there… not to half-assedly take the incest route, crushing souls all along the way. And even in the end, the author doesn’t commit to this serving of taboo (apparently forced by the publisher) and cops out of the whole thing. Whatever, I was more butthurt over this ending than I should have been especially considering that I really wasn&#39;t attached to the show… or at least, that’s what I thought. It makes me uneasy that the bitch herself is currently at the top of the &quot;popular art&quot; block and <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/weekend-swag/">also stares at me as I’m falling asleep</a>...</p>
<h2 id="what-the-fuck-anime-">What the Fuck, Anime?</h2>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mww0.jpg" alt="" title="GJ-bu">
<strong>Matt - <em>GJ-Club</em></strong>
GJ-bu (or &quot;Good Job Club&quot;) is, on the surface, Yet-Another-Do-Nothing-Club™ anime that&#39;s also kind of harem-y with a dash of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things®. Kyouya is our male protagonist in a club with four (at some point, five) girls. Apparently, they kidnapped him and (presumably) forced him to join. That kind of sets the tone for the entire show, really. He is their boy toy; a male upon which they can fire off odd females wiles… I guess, I mean they&#39;re not wiles I would ever associate as being stereotypically female. For example, they&#39;re teasing him about whether he thinks he&#39;s popular with the girls and they all start rubbing themselves on him. Or they all get him to brush their hair at some point (this show has a serious hair fetish) which moistens all the women&#39;s panties, apparently.</p>

<p>It&#39;s derogatory to both sexes, it seems; the females act like they need a man, so they order this balless wimp around like they’re in some sort of cute S&amp;M dungeon.</p>

<p>The characters are kind of cute, I guess, and there are a few genuinely funny moments (mostly when &quot;Hachiman&quot; shows up), but that sub-text just makes the whole show feel unsettling.[/i]</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/ja-a-tale-of-two-countries">Ja* - A Tale of Two Countries</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 25, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>2013 marked my first foray into the joys of international travel, doing it not once but twice. In an interesting twist of fate, both of those countries started with the letters &quot;JA&quot; (the only two in the world, even). They are worlds apart, however, both in physical distance and atmosphere/culture. Let&#39;s do a pros/cons.</p>
<h2 id="japan">Japan</h2>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody is very respectful of others and mostly keep to themselves. The introvert in me loves this.</li>
<li>It&#39;s clean. Though some places may look a little run down, the overall level of cleanliness is pretty high</li>
<li>Shit is organized. There were a couple of times when the road to Asakusa was blocked for utility work or something and they had cones marking precisely how traffic was now being directed... and also a friendly guy there to point you in the right direction.</li>
<li>Conversion rate is essentially 1JPY = 0.01USD. Makes for easy conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Probably contrary to the cleanliness bit, there was a constant smell of old garbage/water mold lingering around. It was only in certain spots, but it was a trifle off putting.</li>
<li>Cramped. The trains, the layout of the buildings, etc is designed to pack the most stuff into the smallest space. Not great for my introversion and large body.</li>
<li>Language barrier. They <em>really</em> don&#39;t speak English well when they do at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jamaica">Jamaica</h2>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The resorts are such that you really never need to leave; all your whims are attended to</li>
<li>The beach</li>
<li>The exchange rate for the Jamaican dollar is about 1JMD = 0.01USD. Granted, you may as well just use American money because it&#39;s less likely to depreciate in value and everybody takes it anyways.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It may seem like everybody is super friendly, but it&#39;s that kind of friend that stops paying attention to you when they find out you&#39;re not popular/don&#39;t have money/etc. Money gets you everywhere.</li>
<li>The food will make you shit... a lot and explosively. If you&#39;re wise, you&#39;ll pull a Steven Spielberg and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark#Filming">bring your own food</a>.</li>
<li>The Jamaicans running the tourist stuff are essentially parodies of the stereotype. So much &quot;mon&quot;, Bob Marley, and general &quot;no shits given&quot; (the above shits excepting) were way, way overused. Also, my brand of &quot;fun&quot; and theirs are very different, but they&#39;ll try to force it on you anyways. Granted, I&#39;ve had friends try to get me involved in such activities as well. Looking at you, dancing...</li>
<li>Jamaica is a third world country. Outside the fancy resorts and tourist spots, it&#39;s really fucking run down and the people are super poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the battle of J countries, Japan is the obvious victor (though, my opinion is certainly heavily biased).</p>

Per usual, we&#39;re kicking it off by picking our top openers and enders of the year. Steve is absent this year because he&#39;s being <em>super lazy</em> and lying on the couch whining that he doesn&#39;t have enough time to write - forget the fact that Chris and Jeff started and finished just moments ago. But whatever, here we go!</p>
<h2 id="best-opener">Best Opener</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OkpRK2_gVs"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/8OkpRK2_gVs/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p><strong>Matt - Guren no Yumiya (<em>Attack on Titan</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Trying to figure out what the best songs of the year is a difficult task. It&#39;s even worse when you have to write words about why you enjoy said aural experience. But, this year was completely easy. The very first time I heard Attack on Titan’s first opening back, I knew it was going to be taking this position. The music itself is all fired up and high energy, with lots of choral bits, lots of trumpets, and just general awesomeness. Married perfectly with this amazing track is some slick, high production animation with lots of high action scenes and some interesting typographical interludes. Overall, these two pieces combined make for one hell of an opener and will not be easily matched anytime soon.</p>
<p>[break]</p>
<p><strong>Chris - Guren no Yumiya (<em>Attack on Titan</em>)</strong></p>
<p>We all know this is the case, so this doesn’t really need to be said, but Guren no Yumiya was by far the best OP of 2013.  Not only is the song excellent - although this sadly doesn&#39;t carry over to the full version - but the visuals work with the song to get you super pumped up and your pants off.  That&#39;s pretty badass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1GN5O6mx4"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2c1GN5O6mx4/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p><em>(Note - this is a promotional video and not the actual opener. It is the right song, however)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jeff - May I Help You? (<em>Servent x Service</em>)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;May I help you?&quot; from &quot;Servant x Service&quot; Is the opening theme I have chosen to be the best of the year. Originally I was going to go with &quot;Guren no Yumiya&quot;, but the full version of said song cannot be rightfully called such and was dropped like a sack of shit. That was on fire. And also poisonous.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still super pissed about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;May I help you?&quot; is a delightfully upbeat song and a pleasure to listen to in both the short and long versions. I was going to write more about why I like this song, but I don&#39;t have anything more to say about it. Listen to it. Love it.</p>
<p>Fuck you, &quot;Guren No Yumiya long version&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="best-ending">Best Ending</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_ErEdPos_o"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/g_ErEdPos_o/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p><strong>Matt - Bokura no Tsubasa (<em>Haganai NEXT</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, unlike the hands down winner that was best OP, I had to go back to play stats for best ED, but I’d say this fits the bill. I can’t say why I enjoyed it, but it’s certainly catchy and I can’t think of anything better to put here.</p>
<p><strong>Chris - Bokura no Tsubasa (<em>Haganai NEXT</em>)</strong></p>
<p>I’m really not good at writing about music - fuck that shit - but I will say that Haganai S2 has a very good ED from a musical standpoint.  But, more than that, I found the art that went with it to be very beautiful, using a mixture of bright - but not oversaturated - colors and outlines to create a very nice visual aesthetic.  I usually sit through the ending anytime I watch an episode of anime, but I made special care to do so in this case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLFx0yedlxc"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/vLFx0yedlxc/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Daisy (<em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Initially I was going to go write off 2013 as not having produced a single super great ending song and that it sucked. Then I watched Watamote and found &quot;Natsu Matsuri&quot;. This was it. The one ED of 2013 that I found super great.</p>
<p>Then I heard &quot;Daisy&quot; from &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; and chose that instead.</p>
<p>Yes, &quot;Daisy&quot; is most definitely my favorite 2013 ending. I feel that it caps off each episode perfectly, and emanates a feeling of hope regardless of how the episode ended. To say nothing of the fact that it sounds damn nice would be an atrocity.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Fuck you, &quot;Guren No Yumiya long version&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&#39;s all for day one. Check in later for the next wave!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/days-of-future-past">Days of Future Past</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 21, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I don&#39;t entirely recall why, but last year I sent my one-year-in-the-future self a note with what I predicted would be my life in 2013. Yesterday, I received that letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Me (in the future),
I&#39;m doing this on a whim, nothing really to say. devusb has said that 2013 would be the year you get a girlfriend, but your current self is dubious. My predictions for 2013 are a repeat of 2012 with the possibility of having a house. Hopefully that trip to Japan happened and that you got a Super Famicom (with Panel de Pon if&#39;n you can swing it). Good luck, we&#39;re all counting on you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much said, but I&#39;m 2/3 in predictions. The needle on the girl front went even less of anywhere this year than last and that Japan trip certainly did happen (with the SFC and Panel de Pon). That one part in the middle is so wrong, though, that saying my letter was 66% correct doesn&#39;t seem quite fair.</p>
<p>Because as has been stated before, this year was nothing like 2012.</p>
<p>Now, to go pen myself a letter for next year.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/my-life-cant-be-this-interesting">My Life Can&#x27;t Be This Interesting</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 12, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I&#39;m sitting in the Atlanta airport awaiting the flight that will whisk me into Jamaica to celebrate the marriage of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">oldest friend</a>. I&#39;m short on sleep, having lost three hours on the flight over from the Pacific coast, and am oddly reflective on the previous year.</p>
<p>Never have I considered my life to be anything interesting. When I&#39;m not at work, I&#39;m generally doing nothing. Or, at least nothing outside. My down time consists of bumming around on the internet, watching TV, or playing video games. It&#39;s an introverted bachelor&#39;s paradise; I wouldn&#39;t even know what to do &quot;outside&quot; if I were to venture out of my hallowed kingdom. But, somehow, 2013 has turned some of that on its head and been by far the most interesting year of my time alive. Items of particular note are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Got a job at fuckin&#39; LinkedIn.</strong> I still don&#39;t understand how this happened, but it&#39;s been by far the best thing that&#39;s happened to me</li>
<li><strong>Moved to the fuckin&#39; Bay Area.</strong> Second best thing that&#39;s happened to me. I don&#39;t think I could live anywhere else again (except maybe Japan)</li>
<li><strong>Went to fuckin&#39; Japan!</strong> Ever since my brothers and I were bitten by the anime bug back in 2008, this was something we wanted to realize... and we made it happen! Every now and then I still get super bummed that I&#39;m not there right now.</li>
<li><strong>Fuckin&#39; presented at my alma mater.</strong> Perhaps it was slightly egotistical of me to want, but ever since I graduated Full Sail in 2009, I&#39;d hoped to return as a presenter. And this year LinkedIn helped me realize that on a campus recruiting mission.</li>
<li><strong>Got fuckin&#39; drunk... many times.</strong> Perhaps this shouldn&#39;t be a highlight, but these drinking sprees have given me an opportunity to connect with so many awesome people. Perhaps it&#39;s not the medium so much as it is the setting. Either way, I&#39;ve had many great conversations over one too many beers.</li>
<li><strong>Fuckin&#39; brackets, son</strong>. In addition to the awesome people I get to physically see on a daily basis, there&#39;s the community over at /r/awwnime that I&#39;ve come to know as well. And running the brackets this year is fun for me both because I get to watch people enjoy (or hate) a thing I&#39;ve created, but also because it brings out a lot of interesting discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Went (or am going) to fuckin&#39; Jamaica</strong> to participate in the wedding of <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">my oldest friend.</a> (Holy shit dude. You win!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are only the major highlights, but 2013 has been a hell of a year. It&#39;s made me realize just how awesome my life is and at the same time makes me wonder what I ever did to deserve it. And every day I&#39;m so thankful that I get to wake up where I am, go to where I work, and interact with all the wonderful people that I know. If I were manlier, I might even shed a tear.</p>
<p>But enough of that smarmy ass sentimental bullshit, expect pictures of Jamaican shores and the annual anime reviews to be kicking up soon. But until then, <a href="http://www.baconorbeercan.com/">I leave you with this</a>.</p>
