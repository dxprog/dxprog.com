It&#x27;s the winds of change...</h2><time>April 5, 2006</time><div><p>In what could be marked as a pardigm shift for me I have purchased my first &quot;real&quot; song off of iTunes, meaning it is a modern rock song. Now the song, which I will name, I&#39;ve heard plenty of times at Wal-Mart (as much as one can hear it over <em>beep</em> <em>beep</em> <em>beep</em> and all the chatter), but I suppose I have devusb to thank for it in the end. Using some iTunes VPN thingy I was digging through his music this morn and I was able to listen to the entire song and found, horror of horrors, I actually liked it. This leads me to wonder if I shouldn&#39;t broaden my musical horizons just a hair.... But anyhoo, you&#39;re probably wondering what song could cause such a cataclysmic shift in such a humble being as myself. It&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=73648639&amp;s=143441&amp;i=73648643">Dirty Little Secret</a>&quot; by the All-American Rejects.</p>
<p>In job news I am going to be blunt and to the point: the deptartment managing specialist job SUCKS! That said I am going to beg to have my cashier job back by May. I can&#39;t stand this job anymore. The hours (and lack thereof) stink, the lack of human interaction is driving me insane and a couple of other reasons I will leave unsaid (to save my job and reputation). Had I realized that this is how things were going to be I would have stopped complaining about my cashier job and been happy. We&#39;ll see how things go down, though.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for now. In about fifteen minutes I have to be at the eye doctor&#39;s for an appointment. Stay tuned for my next post where I&#39;ll do a little bit of ranting again (yay! ;-)).</p>
<p>PS - Gold stars to anybody who can name the quotes I&#39;ve been stuffing into my posts lately.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Windows Vista Blows...</h2><time>April 1, 2006</time><div><p>...and sucks, at the same time!</p>
<p>Yesterday I thought it would be &quot;fun&quot; to test drive the beta of Microsoft&#39;s latest and &quot;greatest&quot; OS, Windows Vista. Hah! It&#39;s slow, it&#39;s incomplete and it gives Windows a bad name (wait....). And even worse, when I went to install XP again the Vista file permissions and junk remained so nothing worked. So I had to back my crud up, reformat my hard drive and start from scratch. As of this moment I&#39;m running without SP2 which is probably suicide :-P.</p>
<p>In work related news, I moved up again. A couple days ago I helped to resolve a rather sticky customer situation and the manager&#39;s were so impressed that I&#39;ve been offered to be promoted to support manager. This would give me the option of moving back to days which would thrill me to no end. However, having nothing but gripey customers <em>and</em> employees to look forward to would be like belly flopping into the bowls of hell. So I&#39;m still thinking about it. I did get some good news in my current job. Michael Jordan (no relation to the basketball player) is getting his hours changed so I won&#39;t be alone in the back which will be nice. It&#39;ll actually be possible to get everything done.</p>
<p>Well, I need to go upstairs and get SP2 installing (stupid butthead needs to be plugged in :-P). Until next time, happy April Fools :-)</p>
