[quote]It&#39;s been nearly twenty-four hours since I last surfed the social web. Despite the cravings I&#39;ve had to see how my karma seeds are growing, I haven&#39;t found it too difficult to not turn the computer on. At work, I kept myself busy with actual work and these math/programming challenges Mickael dug up. At home, I did wind up watching HIMYM because I didn&#39;t feel like torrenting it next week. But since, I&#39;ve kept myself busy with a walk to Wal-mart, making and consuming pumpkin bread, and gratuitous reading. Now, I am drawing myself a batch and will probably read and then turn in.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Unjacked - Day 0</h2><time>October 8, 2012</time><div><p>So, I have successfully completed my little one week sans-Internet challenge. I would leave my thoughts here, but as stated, I kept small little journalings through out. In the spirit of nigh-free blog fodder, I shall post the scans (plus a transcription after the break because my handwriting is terrible).</p>

<p>[quote]Day 0:  10-1-12</p>
<p>It has been about forty minutes since I shut down my computer. Fairly typical for a work evening, but what is not typical are all the thoughts of stuff I&#39;ll be missing, How I Met Your Mother, for instance. Also, writing in a straight line is hard. I suppose my plan of action at this point is to read something and then go to bed. I will sorely miss my asmr videos to be sure... Only seven days left...[/quote]</p>
