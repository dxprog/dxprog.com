Especially when I know I&#39;m just going to ramble about random stuff.</p>
<p>Today marks the three week mark until move out day. Excited? Yes. Packed? Partially. I started packing last week and have pretty much gotten to the point where&#39;s there&#39;s nothing left to pack save what I&#39;m currently using (Xbox, computer, TV, that stuff). I suppose I could pack up my pots and pans and malarky, but eh...</p>
<p>I did wind up trading Pokemon (and a myriad of other games) in and picked up a copy of Puzzle League. It&#39;s good, but it definitely is NOT Tetris Attack. Ranked matches... well there really aren&#39;t ranked matches. The closest thing is the &quot;Birthday Mode&quot; which ranks you against people with the same birthday. I&#39;m number one... and the only person on the list. Not many people play PPL online. Another thing that cheeses me off is the difficulty level; it&#39;s too easy. There&#39;s really slow, slow and about what would equate to normal in TA. Nothing in between. The music sucks too. It&#39;s just standard ambient/techno type music like you&#39;d find in Lumines or any recent (non-DS) Tetris game. The music from Tetris Attack was awesome. Every single piece. I&#39;ve got the Blargg music on my iPod for heaven&#39;s sake! That&#39;s how awesome it is. But otherwise, it is Tetris Attack and I can play online but they&#39;ve screwed up the best puzzle game of all time.</p>
<p>I took a little Lord of the Rings quiz thingy on Facebook (which is definitely better than MySpace) and I&#39;m a true LOTR fan. The questions were rediculously easy like &quot;What race is Legolas?&quot; Some information I suppose probably can&#39;t be gleaned from the movies. But at that even a casual reader of the books could get all the questions right. Either that or I&#39;m a bigger nerd that I thought. Meh.</p>
<p>Well, like a said, general ramblings of random stuff.</p>

<p>The start of a new arc. Pretty pleased with most of the artwork here, except Bowser in that last panel. Missed yesterday&#39;s update, but oh well. It&#39;ll be coming Monday. Technically all I need to do is arrange it as I&#39;ve got the artwork all drawn up. Now on to some artworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Soccer-Peach-62759561"><img src="http://www.deviantart.com/download/62759561/Soccer_Peach_by_dxprog.png" alt="" title="image"></a></p>
<p>This was going to be the first panel <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/211204/bad-idea/">Monday&#39;s comic</a>, but when it came down laying everything out it just didn&#39;t fit. Probably the most risque thing I&#39;ve ever drawn, but don&#39;t blame me. Blame Nintendo. They love their Peach pr0n, I &#39;spose.</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Guitar-Hero-Band-62839995"><img src="http://www.deviantart.com/download/62839995/Guitar_Hero_Band_by_dxprog.png" alt="" title="image"></a></p>
<p>I wanted to try drawing some chibis and something Guitar Hero. This is what came out. I like the bassist and the singer best.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve played Strikers you&#39;ll no where I&#39;m coming from.</p>
