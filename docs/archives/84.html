The major question I&#39;m sure that&#39;s on everybody&#39;s minds is &quot;Why do you redesign your blog so often?&quot; After pondering this question myself I have come to the conclusion that I just enjoy coming up with new designs. This in turn begs the question why go live with every new design? Why not just create the designs on the side and leave the live version alone? Because I end up liking what I&#39;ve just created more than what&#39;s currently implemented. </p>
<p>The relationship I have with any piece of art I create is generally a strained one. I&#39;m very self-critical of everything I create. It is very rare that I make something that I like for any extended period of time. I think the problem stems from the fact that every time I see one of my works I begin finding flaws. These flaws are not necessarily seen by others, but I can see them. This is generally fine for, say, a movie or a drawing. I don&#39;t have to look at them once they&#39;re done. My website, however, is something I see fairly often. I come to see if people have left comments, to post entries, etc. It is hard for me to turn a blind eye to any flaw I see in the design when I am faced with it over and over.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, I also just plain and simple like creating new designs and trying out new things. As I surf the internet I am constantly bombarded by all sorts of different color schemes, layouts, etc. and these intrigue me. I get all excited and before too long I&#39;ve got Photoshop and Notepad++ up and running and I&#39;m hacking away at the latest entry of my long list of designs. Excluding the Wordpress and Blogger themes, I have made live three designs for my blog since June of &#39;05. That&#39;s not including the designs I had from &#39;01 to &#39;03, anything I created for any of the various other sites I&#39;ve managed (YPN, my church&#39;s website, Digital Double), or the designs that never saw the light of day.</p>
<p>I realize that changing up the site design so frequently is not necessarily a good thing, especially in a commercial environment. It can confuse people and probably would piss some off to the point of not returning. Granted, there are sites that do this (digg comes to mind). However, since this is my personal blog, my sandbox as it were, I&#39;m not worried about too much. I generally try to keep the overall aspects more or less the same breaking everything down into navigation, body, extras. </p>
<p>Though it is beyond the scope of this article, one thing I have messed up through all the redesigns is my URL naming conventions. Usually when I roll out a new design I&#39;m also rolling outa new CMS (conent management system) to go with it and these don&#39;t always use the same naming conventions for internal links. This causes links in older posts, google&#39;s index, etc. to become broken and raises general chaos. I&#39;m happy with my naming conventions now and this will remain the same even when I do change the back end. Permalinks will be exactly that.</p>
<p>So, that is the &quot;logic&quot; behind my madness, tune in next week to watch the evolution of my designs and learn the rules behind them.</p>

A lot had happened since then. I&#39;ve completed my first month of school and, as such, my first set of classes. Now I won&#39;t pretend to understand I know how a traditional college works but I do know that Full Sail&#39;s approach is much different (and, in my opinion, much more sensical). Every month we have two courses that we attend for four weeks. These are broken down into, generally, five eight-hour days per week with few breaks in between save major holidays. This is how we pull off a four year degree in only twenty-one months. These five day weeks are broken down into one subject being done three days and the other two. This month I was lucky enough to only have four days of school per week but all I did were gen ed classes, namely art history and english composition.</p>
<p><strong>Art History</strong>
Art history was interesting if nothing else. We got see all sorts of art from various periods of time starting with the cave men and their wall paintings. My favorite eras were definitely the Renaissance and Baroque. It is rare to find an artist that skilled these days. The Greeks were awesome as well with all their master marble working. The only problem with them, however, is their crazy preoccupation with penises. I could&#39;ve done without that, thank you very much. We also took a trip to the Orlando Museum of Art. Some pretty interesting stuff their from ancient artifacts up to Andy Warhols. But, the best part of the whole thing was when we had to make our own pieces of art emulating other styles and then have them displayed in front of the whole class. A lot of good laughs shared there. Here&#39;s my pieces:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/arthistory.jpg"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/arthistory.jpg" alt="" title="image"></a>
For this we were supposed to do a cave painting using a movie as the theme. Fifty points to the person who can correctly name the movie.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/MHackmann.jpg"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/MHackmann.jpg" alt="" title="image"></a>
I was shooting for cubism but wound up pulling a weird combo of things, namely cubism, abstract, and pop art. I like it, though.</p>
<p><strong>English Comp</strong>
This is the course I&#39;ve been sweating through the most. Though I have a better than average grasp of English and grammar, primarily through keeping this blog and a lot of reading, I felt that my writing was too erratic and too concise to pull off this class successfully. Luckily we only had to write three papers (four if you include the ungraded one we wrote at the beginning of the course). They were each a different kind of paper, these being a memoir, a print ad analysis, and a research argument. We&#39;ve also had to do some group presentations in front of the class. The last of these almost got seriously screwed up because we misread our little topic card. About ten minutes before we did our presentation we realized this and were scrambling to come up with relevant information. We wound up just pulling the whole thing out of our asses at the last minute but still managed a one hundred. I&#39;m surprised points weren&#39;t taken off for my visible knee shaking.</p>
<p>On the whole I&#39;ve been having a good time considering that I&#39;m in school learning stuff. I&#39;ve made a bunch of friends and at that ones who are in the same boat I am, meaning they can quote the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqiSkd1M6k">300 PG trailer</a>. Next week I get to look forward to designing computer graphics and networks and operating systems as my courses. Should be awesome.</p>

I&#39;m not even necessarily all that busy, just no real drive to write anything on this blog. However, there is something I need to bring to light and here it is:</p>

I&#39;m completely loving my Mac Book Pro. It&#39;s doubley more awesome that my Mac mini in almost every respect. Clock speed, RAM, hard drive space, video, you name it this thing is better. And it&#39;s portable. And it gets blazing hot when it&#39;s doing heavy processing, hotter than the surface of the sun I&#39;d say.</p>
<p>Yesterday I picked up my books and softwares, those being Final Cut Studio 2 and Adobe Creative Suite 3 (adds up to a grand total of $3000+). I loaded up CS3 immediately and had fun doing stupid Photoshop jobs all day.</p>
<p>[gallery=Photoshop Fun]<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/matt_and_jessica.png" alt="" title="My roommate Matt and the very pretty Jessica Alba"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/matt_lost.png" alt="" title="Ms. Alba is fine, but Claire is finer...">[/gallery]</p>
<p>I tried screwing around with FCS2 last night but didn&#39;t really get anywhere. Final Cut Pro itself seems fairly straight forward so far but I couldn&#39;t figure out Color (color grading app) which is a bummer because one thing that my videos need are to be color graded.</p>
<p>School doesn&#39;t start until Tuesday and I&#39;m beginning to get a little bored. E and I have been playing Halo 2 and we watched all the Back to te Future movies, but I&#39;m ready for school. I do have my copy of Eternal Sonata now so maybe that&#39;ll ease the pai of waiting even if just by a little bit. I could always draw, I suppose. But I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to top this:</p>

Lots of them. Be patient.</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;ll start with the beginning. I was born around 10ish on June 8th, 1986. Life was pretty good until they cut my umbilical cord. You see I... Okay, too far back.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Sept. 17th, was a crazy, hectic day because I really hadn&#39;t packed much up to that point. About the only things I <em>had</em> packed were my books and DVDs. That left this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/1420193247/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1115/1420193247_fa89023cc4.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></a>
(be sure to follow the link. I&#39;ve got region thingies set up on the flickr page)</p>
<p>As you can see it was quite a hellish nightmare. But, I got everything packed and by that evening it looked more like this:
<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1171/1421086050_df18fa477f.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Evening came and morning followed the first day.</p>
<p>The next day, Tuesday, began the first leg of our near thirteen hundred mile trip. After I said goodbye to my family we started off. Then we promptly returned because I&#39;d forgotten some things (that&#39;s not to say I got everything I&#39;d forgotten, though). That day we drove about seven hundred some odd miles, well over half the trip, passing through five states (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama). We stayed in a little town past Birmingham called Oxford. Evening came and morning followed the second day.</p>
<p>There&#39;s really not a whole lot to say about the second day of driving. We passed through Atlanta (uneventfully I might add) and drove from there on down to Florida. One thing I will say about Atlanta, though, is that there&#39;s an assload of cars on the road. Twelve lanes and all of them packed. Once in Winter Park it took about an hour and a half to find our lodging for the night. Luckily we <em>did</em> find it and it was an easy drive to the apartments. We ate at Boston Market that night. It was pretty good (though the service was... weird). I&#39;ll forgo the Genesis reference this time.</p>
<p>So, it was finally the big day (or at least one of them). We made our way over to the apartments and got there without any trouble. However, we did circle the whole complex nearly three times before we found the leasing office which was tucked away discreetly behind some trees. It was there that I met up with my roommate and signed my life away to the dark cabal that controls everything. However, we did get a sweet apartment in return:
[gallery=Apartment Interior]<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1236/1421089654_1a18b56f51.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="Outside of the apartment"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1108/1420210229_abcdacfb10.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="The kitchen/dining area as seen from the living area"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1119/1421096474_7c9f384a2b.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="The living area as seen from the kitchen"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1372/1420216699_1a8c8af39e.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="The kitchen"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1092/1421146404_8ebaa5d008.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="My entertainment stuff setup and garbled cable TV coming in through the wall">[/gallery]</p>
<p>As you can see in that last picture we have a sweet TV setup (or I do. It&#39;s all my stuff). The gibberish on the screen is our (at the time) messed up cable. Dragging everything up and in wasn&#39;t to big of a deal and really didn&#39;t take too long. Getting setup, that was another story all together. My room isn&#39;t completely unpacked yet though it&#39;s functioning at one hundred percent capacity.</p>
<p>That evening we went and bought some furniture.</p>
<p>[gallery=The Furniture]<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1179/1420255003_9dbece64bd.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="The most comfortable couch in the world!"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1314/1420255853_82ff3bf7e3.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="...and the lowly coffee table">[/gallery]</p>
<p>The next day we didn&#39;t do much aside from pull in some of the more minor items we needed. I spent a good chunk of the day working on the mess that was my room. I think I did anyways... By this time it was Saturday and I had to see my Dad off as he prepared to redrive the roads we had just been on. We (my roommate and I) didn&#39;t do much over the weekend. Bought some stuff, played some games, watched some TV, drew some pictures. Just kept low. Then came yesterday (Monday).</p>
<p>We were both getting kind of tired of not having much to do so we packed up and went to the beach. Daytona Beach, that is. Up to that point the closest I had ever been to the beach was watching LOST so it was something completely new for me. It was a hell of a lot of fun. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/1437562805_85b20260f6.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>We tossed a Nerf football around, we rode some waves, we walked up the beach (probably a mile or more not including the trip back). Being the off season there weren&#39;t too many people there and at that most of them were seniors. With the exception of the little kids we were the youngest people there. While it was fun and all there was a price to be paid. I had purchased some sunscreen before we&#39;d gotten there, but was unable to get my back. My roommate, who I will refer to as E, didn&#39;t put any on at all. So by the time we got home he was completely red and my back felt like it was on fire. That evening we laid low and watched all the new offerings on NBC and headlines on Jay.</p>
<p>Tonight we&#39;re going to be going to a little meeting thing at the school and tomorrow is registration and the getting of our Mac Book Pros. It&#39;ll be sweet to be sure. I&#39;ll be back a full update including pics. Until then, stay cool.</p>
