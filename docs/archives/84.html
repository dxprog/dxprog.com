Also, my brother and I have run out of things to watch, having finished seven seasons of How I Met Your Mother and rewatched both seasons of Higurashi in about a couple months. We&#39;re about to start watching Clannad again, but there&#39;s actually a simple solution to both of these problems.</p>
<p>And that solution is programming.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned before, but about half a mile up from work is a branch of the local library. They have a pretty decent collection of Blu-rays. So, I wrote a <a href="http://pastebin.com/1H0gZ6XY">small script</a> to scrape all the <a href="http://pastebin.com/ix4Px68c">blu-ray titles</a> at that location and, at random, pick four movies for us to watch. Here&#39;s what it came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seven Years in Tibet </li>
<li>Star Trek - The Motion Picture</li>
<li>The Silence of the Lambs </li>
<li>9</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 4 was originally <em>Superman Returns</em>, but my brother and I have already seen that and so decided to reroll.</p>
<p>I suppose out of a data set of only 460+ there was bound to be one movie I&#39;d recognize, but not all four.</p>
<p>So, each day on my lunch break, I will bravely trek up to the library to fetch one of these discs. If one shouldn&#39;t be available, I&#39;ll move to the next item on the list. If I go past the end, a new movie will be randomly selected. This movie will then be watched and I will give a short review of my feelings at the end.</p>
<p>Seriously, being a programmer is akin to being a wizard in the Harry Potter world. I don&#39;t know how you muggles make it...</p>

There was no exchange of money, but many <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/lunch/">lunch battles</a> were had.</p>
<p>One of the items was a <a href="http://www.jbox.com/product/KING132">Japanese microwave potato chip maker</a>. He&#39;d never used it himself, so passed it on to me to be the brave one to try such odd novelties. I accepted his challenge to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>And then it sat in my closet for over a year.</p>
<p>That is, until today when, in a fit of super boredom, I decided that giving this thing a shot would be a good way to kill some minutes and also satiate my rumbling stomach (didn&#39;t work, wound up at Taco Bell anyways).[break]</p>

<p>The setup is pretty easy: peel potato, slice in the slicer, arrange in the holder, nuke for around five minutes. What came out was actually pretty good. They&#39;re kind of like a cross between normal chips and potato wedges, crispy on the outside with a little bit of give inside.</p>
<p>I may actually use this thing again and experiment with seasonings. Also, hopefully I&#39;ll have larger potatoes next time.</p>
