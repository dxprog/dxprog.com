<strong>Chris - <em>My Little Monster</em></strong>
When 2012 started, little did I know that I would close out the year by watching a shoujo title, which -- let&#39;s not beat around the bush here -- are made for girls.  But I did.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>What I found in My Little Monster was a great little romcom with some great characters and a good -- if not flip-floppy -- central romance.  While the show&#39;s shoujo roots are apparent in the art style, most everything in the show is enjoyable even by manly men.  Best of all, there was no gaggle of wooden male characters -- I&#39;m looking at you Hiiro no Kakera.</p>
<p>The only real problem I had was the somewhat disappointing ending, or rather, the lack of an ending.  Few of the plot threads were wrapped up, leading me to hope that a second season is around the corner -- and let me tell you, I would love to see that.

<p>And what a shaming I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I have eaten out several times this week (once being Taco Bell) and had a drinking party last night. Granted, my brother is in town and we&#39;re celebrating New Year&#39;s a bit belatedly, so I&#39;m going to write it off this once. On the upside, I have made more food and not had McDonald&#39;s in this thirteenth year of the 21st century.

The categories are changed up slightly from last year, but remain more or less the same. But, enough intro, here&#39;s Chris and I&#39;s favorite tunes of the year.</p>
<h2 id="best-opening">Best Opening</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - <em>Crossing Field (Sword Art Online)</em></strong>

<p>It would be inaccurate to state that I know how to explain music, or why I like certain songs more than others. Unfortunately, my cognitive capacity for this activity is far outweighed by the naturalness of describing things assaulting my other, far more supple senses.</p>
<p>But here goes.</p>
<p>This song kicks ass – I can’t explain why, but that is the way of things, and that is how they are. Also, there’s some pretty kick-flippin’ animation in the opener that probably rivaled in budget the entirety of Space Brothers.</p>
<p>OH, SNAP.

<p>The year is coming to a close yet again and with it the usual <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2012-things-to-do-before-we-all-die/">self reflective post</a> for my future self to gaze upon. Also, the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/best-of-anime-awards-finale/">anime reviews</a> will kick in soon. Not that anybody cares, but it makes for an interesting read later on. But, without further ado, let&#39;s see how I did on last year&#39;s list of self improvements and what to look forward to in 2013. I hadn&#39;t counted on this seeing as we were all supposed to die a couple weeks back...
