<p>As the title suggest, however, I have made another video. It&#39;s mainly just a fancy edit job of an otherwise fairly boring, yet monumental, event. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Okay, so I cheated a little on this one. However, in my defense, I&#39;m winding up a 6 day run at work with no break in between so what free time I have had I&#39;ve spent doing other stuff. I promise that Friday&#39;s will be a good one (it&#39;s the one with the &quot;complex&quot; artwork I mentioned earlier).</p>

<p>I am actually a fairly large fan of Peanuts (at least, pre-80s Peanuts). However, one thing that drove me insane was that Charlie Brown never stood up for himself. He allowed his life to be a constant joke to everybody and everything around him. He should&#39;ve taken Plankton&#39;s advice and asserted himself as he does here.</p>
<p>Interesting side note, there&#39;s currently a manager at Wal-Mart whose name is Charlie Brown (seriously, what were those parents thinking :-P).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t kids just say the darndest things?</p>
<p>I hate family circus. It&#39;s about a bunch of &quot;cute&quot; obese children. I hate it.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Random Stuff and... stuff :-P</h2><time>August 6, 2006</time><div><p>Well, obviously Friday&#39;s comic will be Monday&#39;s. Sorry about that. With me being at work most of the day it&#39;s a little difficult to get much done :-P.</p>
