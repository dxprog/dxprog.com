<p>Seriously, this is absolutely insane. I missed everything until now because our router decided to die leaving me without internets. So, I&#39;ve got things kind of working now, I go to check digg and there&#39;s about two pages of front page stories containing, in some way shape or form, the following hexadecimal number: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. I guess Digg got a cease and desist from the good old MP of double A and they started pulling any stories with the following string of numbers and letters: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. Well, people got ticked off because 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 is their favorite copy/paste fodder so they inundated the place with 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 this and 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 that and that&#39;s where it stands now. Apperantly K. Rose and Co. are allowing 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 to be shown all over the place and say that if it kills Digg that&#39;s fine since they went down with a mutha-09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 fight. Personally, if Digg goes down due to this I may start pirating ALL my movies just to let them know how pissed off I am.</p>
<p>Thanks, have a nice 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 day.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&#39;s think for a second. Why would you have a single encryption key for EVERYTHING!? You people are stupid bastards. G&#39;Day. 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/flori-duh">Flori-duh!</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 28, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>No offense to the state, just a little thing Dave Berry is always pointing out (you can&#39;t spell Florida without the &quot;duh&quot;). If I haven&#39;t mentioned the fact that Dave Berry is one of the funniest columnists alive, I will do so now and tell you to go out and get some of his books. The Guide to Guys and Money Secrets are my personal favorites. But, this all really has nothing to do with this blog post so I will move along.</p>
<p>I guess the first thing I want to say is that Guitar Hero II is pretty much the best guitar-based game ever created. I kind of sat on the edge about it for a while because the song list seemed kind of meh compared to it&#39;s predecessor, but I decided to give it a chance and GameFly&#39;d it. I was unimpressed for a while and then I hit the boss song. Freebird. All 9 and a half glorious minutes of it. Needless to say I went out and just bought the game the next day and now I rock out on it all the time. Maybe I&#39;ll post a video sometime. Oh, and a sidenote, this whole Guitar Hero madness made Chris buy an electric guitar so maybe one of us&#39;ll be the next Van Halen or we can form a band and resurrect the glory days of the 80s. Maybe...</p>
<p>I&#39;m back to my old self again and have created a new design for the site. With everybody going &quot;Web 2.0&quot; I figured I&#39;d better jump on the bandwagon and stay current. However, in my defense, the original Tetra design used rounded tables before rounded tables were the thing to do, so I&#39;m a trailblazer there. I&#39;m going to wait to implement the new design until I&#39;ve gotten a new backend written. Wordpress is nice and all, but all the spam (which you lucky souls never see) is really driving me insane. Besides, I can make a less bloated piece of software to suit my needs. When it comes to web stuff I usually trust my own work over that of others. Maybe I&#39;m an egotistical jerk that way :-P.</p>
<p>Shifting to my public life, things at work ar fairly normal. However, I did drop the CSM charade and joined Robin Hood&#39;s Merry Men, or as everybody else knows us, cart pushers. You&#39;re probably thinking &quot;Wow! Why did you take that kind of a pay cut just to push carts, a lowly job made for the slime of the Earth?&quot;. Firstly, I wasn&#39;t actually being paid CSM wages, so I lost a whole .40 an hour. Secondly, that .40 an hour has bought me some sanity and hapiness. The lot is a nice, quiet place to be. The carts don&#39;t complain about their credit card being denied, or that something rang up the wrong price, or.... you get the picture. I don&#39;t know about people in other towns, but Bartians seem to be a whiny bunch (I&#39;ll admit I can be whiny as well).</p>
<p>Well, that about wraps it up for this blog post. Tune in next Friday as maybe I&#39;ll make this a weekly thing. It would do me some good to get into some sort of schedule of doing things.</p>
