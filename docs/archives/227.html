WHOOOO!!</a></h1><time class="post__published">December 15, 2005</time></header><div class="post__content">Ah.... I sit in the living room in a nice comfy chair as I write this. Yes.. I got my laptop out this morning. I stayed up all night to do it, but I did it and DANGif it isn't a darn nice feeling :-). I've got a bunch of junk I'm going to need to uninstall (currently there are 14 icons down on the system tray :-P). But at least I've got a processor/RAM combo that can handle a bunch of stuff :-D.

This is a bittersweet feeling, though, because today is the day that all Christmas layaway's are due out. It's probably going to be a hellacious afternoon/evening but at least I'll have something nice to come to tonight :-). That said, though, it may not be so bad because we've got an orderly system in place. From what I understand I'll come in, pick up a car with somebody's layaway, get it and bring it in. That is a far cry from going to to get 5+ layaway's at a time :-P.

But, now I must fiddle with junk. BABEE! :-D</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/laptop-whoooo">LAPTOP!!

It isn&#39;t in my nature to swear, but I hate cart pushing. The last two nights layaway has been dead enough that they&#39;ve sent me out to push carts in the parking lot. I pushed carts in freezing weather for one and a half hours without a hat or gloves on Sunday and for an hour yesterday. Luckily I was smart enough to bring the hat and gloves then. I tell you though, if Wal-Mart calls me back in January and says they want me to be a cart pusher I will turn it down. There is no way in heck I would do that as my main job. There, now it&#39;s out :-P.</p>
<p>On the upside I&#39;ve got only $380 to go on my laptop. I&#39;ll get it out one week from Thursday. It seems like an eternity away, though. But, I&#39;ve been waiting years I think I can wait one more week. I think...</p>

For those of you who don't know I am the creator of such infamous items as the ["Common Cold"](http://dxprog.com/pics/cc.html) and the ["Darth Vader Pancake"](http://dxprog.com/pics/dv_pancake.jpg). However, this eBay auction is a little more sane... just a little. At the very least I'm selling more or less a legitimate item... an e-mail address. That's right, loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com (yes, I actually managed to snag that address). I'm hoping there are plenty of Zelda fans out there who'd like this address and after an Xbox 360 gmail addy went for $570 how can I lose. It'll only be a quarter if I do :-P. But, anyways...

Thursday is pay day again. I've made up a spreadsheet to keep track of my hours and take out all the proper taxes and according to that this paycheck will be about $316.60 (54 hours worked). I've also calculated my current schedule through to the 15th and I'll have just enough to pull out my laptop! YAY! :-D

Later :-)</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/228.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/226.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
