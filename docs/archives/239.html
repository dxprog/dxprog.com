<p>In other news, I finally seem to have gotten accustomed to the grips in my bowling ball. The other night I shot my current all time high of 172... very sweet :-D. I also shot an all time high series of 501.. also very sweet ;-). I&#39;m hoping to take advantage of some of that beautiful free bowling tonight or tomorrow. Dad&#39;s got the rest of the week off so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too hard to swing ;-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gotten myself hooked on Final Fantasy III/VI again. <a href="http://www.consoleclassix.com">Console Classix</a> is a very, very cool thing :-) (though, I&#39;m kind of mooching off my younger brother&#39;s subscription ;-)). I&#39;d forgotten how great that game is. I&#39;m considering getting the FF anthology that was released for the Playstation, but I&#39;m not sure yet. One thing I am sure of is that this weekend I&#39;ll be reserving my copy of Twilight Princess... it looks oh so cool!</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve bored y&#39;all to tears, but hey, now you get ae more personal insight into the person known as... dxprog!</p>

I've gotten myself hooked on Final Fantasy III/VI again. [Console Classix](http://www.consoleclassix.com) is a very, very cool thing :-) (though, I'm kind of mooching off my younger brother's subscription ;-)). I'd forgotten how great that game is. I'm considering getting the FF anthology that was released for the Playstation, but I'm not sure yet. One thing I am sure of is that this weekend I'll be reserving my copy of Twilight Princess... it looks oh so cool!

<p>I decided to pick up the threads of ACPD3. I&#39;ve been having fun getting the idiot BSTRs to work again :-P. I&#39;m going to be moving as much as I can to the DLL this time around and figuring out how to avoid DLL hell, too. For a change people actually seem to be interested this time. But I also basically said I&#39;m shooting to make an Anicro replacement and went for the people who use it. A brilliant strategy :-D.</p>

Coming down the road are a few more styles, and the ability to add sidebars. These can be any Tetra sidebar so I&#39;m going to be rigging up an RSS feed reader sometime in the near future. That combined with the <echoy effect>Universal Document Module</echoy effect> will make Tetra quite a nicely rounded little CMS :-). And for anybody who&#39;d make a rebuttal to that last statement, Tetra is mainly for personal sites or small groups (like YPN), so SHUT UP! ;-).</p>
<p>Ah, I think I shall play some games tonight. I haven&#39;t done that in heaven knows how long :-P. That ought to change pretty quick once I have Twilight Princess in my hot little hands ;-). I do have my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/TAttack.zip">TAttack</a> game. One of the reasons I made it was so that I could play that again (leagally). Well, at least my bros and people on <a href="http://www.tetrisattack.net">tetrisattack.net</a> are enjoying it.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick up the loose threads of <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ACPatDes.zip">ACPD</a> 3 and continue the &quot;war&quot; on Anicro Desapro. Of course, for all I know, ACPD is the most used pattern maker on ACC (probably not, though :-P). Oh well.</p>
<p>Well, I got kind of long winded in that :-P. &#39;Night :-)</p>
