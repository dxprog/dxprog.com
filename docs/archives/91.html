<p>I actually drew this back towards the beginning of the comic, but I never actually finished it because I didn&#39;t like Jimmy&#39;s running stance. It seems a little out of place now that Jimmy is the straight man, but it&#39;s a comic. I would&#39;ve put the comic I started today up, but I want to spend a little extra time making this series look decent. So there you have it.</p>

<p>Now that that&#39;s out of the way I share yet another piece of my immense, unimaginable past. I&#39;m not sure how many people here are familiar with the old show &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; hosted by Lavar Burton, but this has got to be the best episode teh EVAR. I remember watching this when I was probably about 6-7 years old. Ouch :-P. Enjoy:</p>
<p>UPDATE: YouTube has since removed those videos, but one part still seems to be up. I give that to you here:
