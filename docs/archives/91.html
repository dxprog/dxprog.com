Of course, that&#39;s a mouthful of words right there so their brilliant marketing team reduced it down to &quot;bogo&quot;. However, when spelled back out it&#39;s Buy One Get One which is clearly a lie. It should be &quot;bogoho&quot;, but then I guess it sounds like some black guy ordering his prositutes around. Yo! Bo go, ho!</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t made one of these in a while. I was digging through some of my old stuff the other day and found my little comic ideas notebook. I always did like this one and I&#39;m not sure why I never made it. This and <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54176/">Pikachunks</a> were actually written at the same time and were supposed to &quot;air&quot; back to back. But, anyhoo...</p>
<p>Since I can&#39;t use Photoshop anymore and since GIMP sucks I had to ink the comic by hand. BY HAND! Actually, it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Not to say that it is without problems but it works.</p>

Well it&#39;s back, only not quite so themed. The reason I stopped in the first place is because thqat Midna picture really bummed me out. It sucked. Hard core.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve actually got two days worth of drawing goodness, so I&#39;ll give you the first one:</p>

From left to right:
My Guitar Hero guitar. Take special note of the Limozeen and Teen Girl Squad stickers. Okay, they&#39;re kind of hard to see.</p>
<p>Yuna, a la Final Fantasy X</p>
<p>Some teacup from my sisters&#39; tea set.</p>

Mario as seen in Mario Sunshine (an awesome game). I&#39;m really pleased with how that came out. Also, there&#39;s Toad. I wasn&#39;t really trying to get a good shape or anything, I just wanted something to test my new pens out on. Up at the top is a little tuft of hair. Just wanted to practice some hair shading.</p>
