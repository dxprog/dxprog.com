<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag1.jpg" alt="" title="Randomness">
These are the contents of two grab bags I picked up. Nothing terribly interesting, I suppose. And the j-rap CD is just as bad as the cover might lead one to think.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag2.jpg" alt="" title="Katanashi is having a bad day">
This show is pretty hilarious and not very popular (that I know of), so I was surprised to see this at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag3.jpg" alt="" title="Hmm..">
And this is the purchase that has me seriously questioning my life. As I was unfurling it, I began to realize that I had just doomed myself to a life of perpetual virginity. Either that or I&#39;m going to have to find a very forgiving girlfriend.</p>
<p>Very, very forgiving.</p>

I and a band of coworkers had ventured out in May and I enjoyed myself enough to vow to go again (soon). A few days later while I was Skyping family, my dad was waxing nostalgic about his times at Six Flags. I decided that was reason enough to gather everybody up for a grande trip.</p>
<p>While there, I took about 438 photos (mostly quick sequential images), but here&#39;s the best of the bunch:</p>
<p>Our first stop of the day was the &quot;Conquistador&quot;. Not terribly fun, in my opinion, but okay.

But that&#39;s a musing for a future post.</p>
<p>Today we intended to keep things short by just attending the autograph tables. My brother (whom you shall see shortly) was in the longest line of the bunch, along with what were surely a bunch of yaoi fangirls. If you don&#39;t know what yaoi is, I&#39;m not going to be the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/04/11/">one to teach you</a>. While he was in the line, I decided to be an ass and get autographs from all of the other voice actors in the room, all the while casting him assholish faces.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll do a write up about the whole experience and the psychological state it&#39;s left me in later in the week, but for now, here&#39;s some pictures.</p>
