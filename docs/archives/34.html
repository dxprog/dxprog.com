Abrams, I was going to make Star Wars VII</h2><time>October 11, 2013</time><div><p>Fresh out of things to post about, I decided to poke around the darker regions of my backup drive in search of some old material I could use. Apparently, my debut into Star Wars fanfic was not with homoeroticism, but an old screenplay for a Star Wars film I wanted to make somewhere in the early 2000s. Actually, I have <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/moving-on-03/">an old blog post</a> that mentions it. Still, it turns out that this is a complete thing which I don&#39;t honestly remember doing.</p>

<p>On the whole, the level of writing is above what I would have expected of myself at the time, but is entirely juvenile... sad considering I was 16 or 17 years old. It&#39;s full of references to other things both Star Wars and not, a typical naive fanfic trope. Still, the Calvin and Hobbes reference got a good chuckle out of me and, while silly, there were a couple of jokes that made me smirk. Not to say that any of this is good, it&#39;s completely shitty, but I can derive joy in that shittiness. Some, anyways. It&#39;s obvious I was living out some sort of fantasy through Jacen, [one of] the character[s] I was going to play, which is mildly disconcerting.</p>
<p>How I thought I was going to film this with no budget, no equipment, no software, and three actors (myself included), I don&#39;t know. Didn&#39;t stop me from rendering up some 3D stuff.</p>
<p>Sadly (or perhaps, fortunately), that has all been lost to the annals of time.</p>
