Of course, having internet enabled phones means we can take the &#39;net with you wherever you go. You can&#39;t escape the thing, it seems. This goes doubly so for me since my sole source of income hinges on this internet existing. But, in the name of science, I am going to eschew all that for an entire week (insofar as I am able).</p>
<p>Starting at midnight tonight (central daylight time), I will forgo all operations that require the use of the internet with two exceptions: usage at work for work related things, and one particular Skype phone call/gaming session that has already been arranged. Added to that, my computer and various other electronic gadgets at home will remain turned off for the entirety of this experiment. This list includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>TV and any attached device</li>
<li>PlayBook</li>
<li>DS/3DS</li>
<li>PSP</li>
</ul>
<p>I will allow myself the use of my record player for any musical needs I require. Additionally, I will keep my phone turned on for outside contact purposes, but nothing more (essentially what I do now anyways).</p>
<p>Without any of these devices, I shall be forced to more archaic forms of entertainment to keep myself occupied. Like getting started on that pile of books I&#39;ve purchased over the last year but still have not read...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/book_pile.jpg" alt="" title="Ordered in terms of priority, with the exception of some inconsistencies on the numbered books..."></p>
<p>Additional things I&#39;ve considered for my entertainment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a written journal of my time off the grid (which, of course, will be posted here)</li>
<li>Drawing</li>
<li>Biking</li>
<li>Making my own set of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IlHjMa74UE">chain mail</a></li>
<li>Cleaning up my room...</li>
<li>Napping... a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I&#39;d like to say good-bye to reddit, Facebook, twitter, Google Reader, and all my various home programming projects. In case I die from this self-inflicted technological black out, it&#39;s been a good run.</p>
<p>See you guys on the other side...</p>

From my annual Christmas letter to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/my-ideal-first-date/">dating site write ups</a>, I enjoy flexing my prose muscles.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t remember how we got there, but in one of my previous conversations with a certain Mr. Helton, he mentioned something about writing a Wedge/Tycho slashfic. Whether it was a challenge or not, I don&#39;t know, but I accepted it anyways. Here are the fruits of my labors.</p>
<p>A note to my mother - Just don&#39;t read this. It&#39;s all satire, but it would make dinners awkward, I&#39;m sure.

Got my HDs on for this one (SD cards are freaking cheap!). Focus was still a bit of an issue and I didn&#39;t have the advantage of sunlight and I&#39;m not sure how to white balance this camera, but I like the writing better in this one. Or maybe it&#39;s worse. Being a one man video army is tough.</p>

It suffers from focus and framing issues, but it&#39;s stupid anyways so I guess it really doesn&#39;t matter. Also, it would be in HD, but my SD card isn&#39;t fast enough to keep up with that kind of bandwidth which sucks the big one. Anyways, here you go:</p>

I will be adding more drives soon and doing some additional fanciness. Yes...</p>
