<blockquote>
<p>RANGER BOB</p>
<p>EXT. FOREST - DAY</p>
<p>Two KIDS are throwing rocks into a lake when RANGER BOB steps out from behind some trees</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
Hey, you! Throwing objects into the lake is against
park rules!

KID1
Yeah, so what are you going to do about it?
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob pushes both kids into the lake</p>
<pre><code>KID2
Hey! I thought you couldn&#39;t throw things into the lake

RANGER BOB
I didn&#39;t throw you, I pushed you
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob walks off as kids stare at him
Some people are eating when Ranger Bob approaches</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
I&#39;m sorry, but the park calorie limit is 500. Eating that
will exceed the limit. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to take it.
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob grabs food and walks off eating it humming</p>
<p>EXT. FOREST - NIGHT</p>
<p>Two kids are around a camp fire telling ghost stories
Next to them is a sign that reads &quot;No campfires beyond this point&quot; and a line is marked.</p>
<pre><code>KID1
And then he rose out of the darkness and said…
</code></pre><p>Shadow of Ranger Bob rises behind Kid1</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
This campfire is illegal.


KID2
No it ain&#39;t! We&#39;re not over the border.
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob leans of and blows the fire so the flames are over the line</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to write you two up.
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob walks off</p>
<pre><code>KID1
Jerk!
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob is in front of a sunset</p>
<pre><code>ANNOUNCER
Ranger Bob, the supreme symbol of national park authority.
</code></pre><p>Kid comes skipping across the scene and Ranger Bob runs after him</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
Hey you
</code></pre><p>THE END</p>

I&#39;M CLEVER~!</p>
<p>On Boat Day(TM), aka the day where I was drunk for ~14 hours straight, the finale of the evening was at some shady looking Mexican restaurant in a part of San Francisco I was unfamiliar with. Not that I would&#39;ve known where I was anyways, I had just had something called an &quot;Aviator&quot; (it was alright, iirc). But while I was there, I had quite possibly the most delicious hunk of Americanized Mexican food of all time. Today - utilizing all my available means of free transportation - I sought that place back out, a certain <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?authuser=0#!q=El+Farlito+Bar&amp;amp;amp;amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d5512!2d-122.4179414!3d37.7523817!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x808f7e474d4864e5%3A0xd8b448aadf21925!3m8!1m3!1d5546!2d-121.8337824!3d37.2942532!3m2!1i2560!2i1342!4f13.1!4m2!3d37.752696!4d-122.418371">El Farolito</a>, to see if it was just the drunkenness or if it really was that good. I took the scenic route getting there, so begins my visual tale.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hOChVMYh.jpg" alt="" title="Google told me to go up this hill... so I did"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s6ZJfZ7h.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up this hill with railway tie stairs"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aftp40Mh.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up several 45 degree streets until I got to the top with a very impressive view of the city"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NeSQlALh.jpg" alt="" title="Saw this on the way. Not sure what&#39;s going on..."></p>
<p>And so, after much trekking and a lot of cursing the people who built their city on a fucking cliff, I arrived at the promised land. And let me tell you, that burrito was just as awesome as I was hoping it&#39;d be. And super cheap too, only ~$7 for the burrito and a Sprite.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o6vcqwS.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s only 5000 calories"></p>
<p>I debated at this point whether I should literally walk the ten steps down to BART for my return trip or walk back home and attempt to exercise off the guilt. I chose the latter and I&#39;m kind of glad I did. I didn&#39;t realize it on the initial part of the trip, but I&#39;d had my back to the bay the entire time. So as I summited the last hill, I was greeted with a rather picturesque sight.</p>

<p>San Francisco is run down, shit covered, piss scented, creepy bitch of a city, but if you find the right spots, it can be downright beautiful. Still...</p>

Abrams, I was going to make Star Wars VII</a></h1><time class="post__published">October 11, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Fresh out of things to post about, I decided to poke around the darker regions of my backup drive in search of some old material I could use. Apparently, my debut into Star Wars fanfic was not with homoeroticism, but an old screenplay for a Star Wars film I wanted to make somewhere in the early 2000s. Actually, I have <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/moving-on-03/">an old blog post</a> that mentions it. Still, it turns out that this is a complete thing which I don&#39;t honestly remember doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPipvPckL7JZSw2NFFd_HJ7q1A0sHEK-gkDSeBkVE9I">READ IT NOW</a></p>
<p>On the whole, the level of writing is above what I would have expected of myself at the time, but is entirely juvenile... sad considering I was 16 or 17 years old. It&#39;s full of references to other things both Star Wars and not, a typical naive fanfic trope. Still, the Calvin and Hobbes reference got a good chuckle out of me and, while silly, there were a couple of jokes that made me smirk. Not to say that any of this is good, it&#39;s completely shitty, but I can derive joy in that shittiness. Some, anyways. It&#39;s obvious I was living out some sort of fantasy through Jacen, [one of] the character[s] I was going to play, which is mildly disconcerting.</p>
<p>How I thought I was going to film this with no budget, no equipment, no software, and three actors (myself included), I don&#39;t know. Didn&#39;t stop me from rendering up some 3D stuff.</p>
<p>Sadly (or perhaps, fortunately), that has all been lost to the annals of time.</p>

So, whatever.</p>
<h2 id="normal-shows">Normal Shows</h2>
<p><strong>Breaking Bad</strong> - Currently somewhere in season 2. Everybody lost their shit over this show and, while I certainly think it&#39;s well written, it hasn&#39;t quite gotten to the &quot;gripping&quot; part for me yet. Also, the episodes are so long and deep that it&#39;s a hard one to marathon.</p>
<p><strong>Parks and Rec</strong> - Basic sitcom, and a humorous one at that. Unlike Breaking Bad, I could watch this all day. Light and fluffy.</p>
<p><strong>Star Trek (TOS)</strong> - I&#39;m somewhere down at the end of the first season and it&#39;s been entertaining so far. Despite the rocky start it&#39;s had trying to flesh out that universe, the core stories feel very Trek.</p>
<h2 id="anime">Anime</h2>
<p>The new season just started, and I don&#39;t want to give away too much of my opinions for the end-of-year reviews, so I&#39;ll keep this brief.</p>
<p><strong>Kyoukai no Kanata</strong> - The new KyoAni show, so obviously I have to watch. They&#39;ve been on kind of a fantasy/mystery kick lately and this falls right in line with that.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Time</strong> - Some college harem show. The first episode was pretty abysmal, but I&#39;ll stick around for the second to see if it improves and where they go with the cliffhanger ending.</p>
<p><strong>Little Busters Refrain</strong> - I enjoyed the first season enough to watch the second. It&#39;s Key, so generally that means emotionally manipulative stuff even if it&#39;s not being expertly executed by KyoAni.</p>
<p><strong>Nagi no Asukara</strong> - Interesting show about fish humans. I have a super weak spot for oceany type things, and the visuals hit that spot with a jack hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Kill la Kill</strong> - From the guys who brought you Gurren Lagann, another crazy ass, stylized action show.</p>
<p>So, yeah. There&#39;s my post for the day.</p>
