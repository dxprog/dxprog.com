I don&#39;t even know why we give this any mind; time is but a human construct and the &quot;new year&quot; marker could have been placed at any point. Indeed, other cultures have their own ways of keeping time with their own &quot;new years&quot;. Interesting that the concept of a &quot;year&quot;, a larger span of time filled with many smaller demarcations of time, is seen in most of these calendar systems. Still, I&#39;m happy to use an arbitrary position on our planet&#39;s orbit to define the changing of the year. Whatever, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here to talk about.</p>
<p>For myself, 2014 was arguably less exciting than 2013. No sudden life changes, no international trips, just a fairly standard year. Still, it wasn&#39;t without its own interesting things and I&#39;ll now take a look back at the more notable things that happened in a series of very short blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
<p>I&#39;d purchased a bike in 2013, shortly after returning from Japan (partially because my original bike had been stolen while I was gone). Despite having it, I didn&#39;t make use of it nearly as much as I should have. But, this year, I began going on long rides with friends which really makes the whole experience much more appealing. On top of that, I bought a <a href="http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/elite-road/caad8/caad8-6-tiagra">very nice bike</a> and, as I became more accustomed to it, started upgrading that with nice upgrades like better wheels and clips. All said and done, I logged over 1800 miles this year which is an accomplishment I&#39;m quite proud of.</p>
<p>That&#39;s today, tomorrow might be more!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Letters from the Past</h2><time>December 21, 2014</time><div><p>Shortly after writing <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-of-future-past/">this post last year</a>, I sent my future self (me now) another email with my hopes and predictions for the future. Today I have received that email:</p>
<p>[quote]Dear FutureMe,</p>
<p>Hello from the past! I feel a little strange writing this letter considering how WRONG I was on the previous one. But, here we are.</p>
<p>Looking at 2014 from my vantage point, there shouldn&#39;t be much change from the latter half of 2013; you&#39;ll still be at LinkedIn and, of course, in the Bay Area. I&#39;m hoping that you&#39;ll have become slightly more suave with the ladies because that&#39;s really the last item on the checklist.</p>
<p>Also, there&#39;s the very vague possibility of an Oktoberfest trip with the ol&#39; TN folks. At this point in time, I&#39;m not sure how that will play out or if it will and it wasn&#39;t just a bunch of &quot;Whooo!! Riding the high of life&quot; type talk.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;m hoping that summer with Chris hanging out while he interns winds up being every bit as awesome as I&#39;m anticipating right now.</p>
<p>So, get your ass a girlfriend and I&#39;ll see you in a year![/quote]</p>
<p>All in all, that summed up the year pretty accurately. I&#39;m still at LI, still in the bay, and Chris&#39; internship was a lot of fun. Of course, the Oktoberfest trip didn&#39;t happen, but I did wind up visiting all of those folks in their new home of Smogsville, TX just last weekend.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a recurring theme here in the form of &quot;get a girlfriend you big ass&quot;. And, as I prepare to write the letter to myself for next year, that thing will come up yet again. Of course, actually trying to meet somebody would probably be a huge step towards actually realizing this. Having a handful of dates with one girl per year isn&#39;t getting me anywhere very quickly...</p>
