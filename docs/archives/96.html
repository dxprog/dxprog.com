<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Ashe.png"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Ashe.png" alt="" title="Lady Ashe"></a></p>
<p>Overall I&#39;m pretty pleased with it. It&#39;s a far sight better than the original pencil art I had. However, the top part of the body seems to be a bit too small compared to everythiong else. But, considering I don&#39;t draw girls very often I&#39;ll give myself a break. I suppose it&#39;s one of those things I&#39;ll need to work on eventually.</p>
<p>This whole mess of pictures actually comes from one piece of art I&#39;d drawn a while back for a comic (the point of which now escapes me). I&#39;ve enjoyed being able to make purty art again and I may keep it up just to keep me busy until September.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#39;ve begun searching for a roommate. I&#39;ve e-mailed a couple guys now and I hope to hear back from some one. Also, I&#39;m pretty darn sure that I&#39;ll be adding animation as a second degree. Drawing these pictres has really hit home that, hey, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bad of an artist and, most importantly, I had a hell of a time doing it. So I&#39;ll need to e-mail them and see how much it&#39;ll cost me to tack that on. That&#39;d also mean spending twice as long at school, but it&#39;s so freakin&#39; cool that&#39;s hardly a problem ;-).</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/stuff-and-nonsense">Stuff and Nonsense</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 17, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>The list of things I have to do to prepare for college is getting shorter. Currently I&#39;m working on picking out a roommate and after that we&#39;ll work on finding an apartment. Then I&#39;ll need to secure funds and come September 20th[ish] I&#39;ll be moving my stuff out there. So nothing new on that front, I&#39;ll move on to other things. Actually, I lied. I got a call from them the other day making sure I wanted to take the Digital Arts and Design degree because they think I&#39;d be happier in Animation (I promptly said I&#39;d be happy <em>anywhere</em> in that school). But I had actually been thinking of double majoring in either DAD and film or animation and the more I think about it animation and art as a whole has always been a big love of mine so I&#39;m giving that some serious thought.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently getting ready to do another film project this time spoofing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents">Elite Beat Agents</a>. I&#39;d give off more but I don&#39;t want to ruin anything. I&#39;ll be trying out greenscreen stuff for this. It seems <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> now has the ability to do professional green screen removal (with a little finagling) so I&#39;m going to try that out. In particular I&#39;ll be filiming seperate elements against the screen and combining them into one shot. But I have yet to actually build the thing, something I was going to do on days off (Tuesday and Wednesday) but I felt too lazy to drive out to Lowes to buy the stuff. I suppose I&#39;ll do it next week and in the meantime I can flesh out a script. This is something I don&#39;t do often because I have the vision in my head pretty clearly and I don&#39;t want to go through the trouble of writing or storyboarding it out. I&#39;m lazy that way and it&#39;s something I&#39;ll have to get over before I go to Full Sail.</p>
<p>I completed two games this week (the world must be ending). The first one was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Paper_Mario">Super Paper Mario</a> (Wii). It was, as I thought it would be, a comepletely enjoyable experience. The dialoge was top notch, as always, packed with plenty of laughs. The flip mechanism never got old and was always used cleverly. The story line was fairly predictable (I had the ending figured out about half way through). However, next to Zelda it&#39;s the best single player game out there for the Wii so if you own on I&#39;d suggest picking this up.</p>
<p>The second game I completed was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Justice_for_All">Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All</a> (DS) which, I admit, I probably enjoyed <em>more</em> than SPM. It&#39;s definitely not a game you buy for the graphics or sound because they&#39;re meh at best (the art&#39;s not bad, I will admit). What is crucial to this game is story and it delivers 110%. The first case, being the introductory one, wasn&#39;t the greatest but it gets you into the swing of things well enough. The second case was awesome, and probably one of my favorites. The third case had me stumped (to the point of <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">cheating</a>; I&#39;m ashamed). The last case was simply amazing. Just when you think you had it figured out everything was turned on end. They also introduced some things that made things harder and raised moral questions. To say that this game on a whole was absolutely phenomenal is an understatement. If you like story type games (RPGs, text-adventures) you absolutely have to buy this game. If you&#39;re more an action type gamer you probably wouldn&#39;t enjoy it much, but rent it at least. It&#39;ll do you some good. On that note I&#39;ll be buying the first game and third when it comes out.</p>
<p>Now that all that&#39;s out, I&#39;ll leave you with this piece of art I finished this afternoon. Cheerio!</p>

Joe and Steve are the stars this time and it thrilled them to death. However, I can see where directing little kids in movies can be a pain in the ass. If you notice they&#39;re constantly looking at the camera. Ugh. I tried to caputre the feel of a standard commercial you&#39;d see on Nickelodeon, but the flow feels a little off. However, on the whole, I&#39;m definitely pleased with the effects shots (I did all of them, including the last one). One thing that&#39;ll be good about Full Sail will be all the professional tools at my disposal. But, enough banter, here&#39;s the video:</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/saturday-news-update">Saturday News Update</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 6, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Firstly, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/">pictures</a>. More importantly, however, I need to quit with this &quot;firstly&quot;, &quot;nextly&quot;, &quot;that other thingly&quot;.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock today was my big tour of Full Sail. Up till now I&#39;ve been referring to it as &quot;Full Sail, college of awesomeness&quot; however I think I&#39;ll have to start referring to it as &quot;Full Sail, college of kick ass!&quot;. It is seriously that freakin&#39; cool. When every classroom has computers in it (with the exception of one) you know it has to be cool. I&#39;ll try to describe the experience as best I can, but I won&#39;t be able to do justice to it. Please note that the accuracy of the order of events may be questionable.</p>
<p>It all started in a sound stage where the whole opening presentation was treated like a live talk show. The camera came over our heads for a nice sweeping crane shot and came to rest on the guy giving the opening monologue. There was another group in the adjacent sound stage who were watching in on what went on in ours. Once the opening ceremonies were finished they broke the group into the seperate degree sections (Digital Arts and Design for me) and began the &quot;global tour&quot;, i.e. seeing all of the facilities.</p>
<p>We were first led into one of the lecture rooms and were given a rundown of the &quot;LaunchBox&quot; initiative. What that is is the Full Sail and Apple have teamed together to give every student a Mac Book Pro loaded with fancy software such as <a href="https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/DesignPremium&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;promoid=RWTS&amp;nr=0#loc=en_us&amp;rangeUpper=6%2C0%2C65%2C0&amp;HTMLVerRedirect=true&amp;returnURL=%2Fcfusion%2Fstore%2Fhtml%2Findex%2Ecfm%3Fstore%3DOLS%2DUS%26promoid%3DRWTS%26event%3DdisplayProduct%26categoryPath%3D%2FApplications%2FDesignPremium%26distributionMethod%3DFULL&amp;store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/DesignPremium&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;promoid=RWTS&amp;nr=0&amp;viewName=Adobe%20Store%20%2D%20North%20America&amp;pageNotFound=0">Adobe Creative Suite</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/">Final Cut Pro</a>, and <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=5659302&amp;siteID=123112">3DS Max</a> to name the ones I remember. After they rambled on about that and the masters degree program we actually started looking at the cool stuff.</p>
<p>The first place we visited was the new dubbing studio. If you&#39;ve ever watched making-of documenteries you&#39;ve seen the giant sound board and the little couch behind it for the big wigs. Well, it&#39;s all there. We were seated and shown a clip from Return of the King. Apparently the guy who did sound design for the collapse of Barad-dur was a Full Sail graduate.</p>
<p>After that we went into one of the recording booths were some dudes were giving off a live performance. We didn&#39;t stay there very long, but I will say this: it was very, very loud. Also, we passed the server room on our way out of there. Very, very cool. </p>
<p>Next we were led into the motion capture studio. Sadly, the software wasn&#39;t working quite right and the 3d model&#39;s right ankle was twisted in all sorts of crazy manners. Still, how many other colleges have a motion capture studio, I mean, c&#39;mon. Killer!</p>
<p>I&#39;m not completely sure, but I believe after that we went onto another sound stage which was dressed up as an inner city street with a theater at the end. Apparently this is used to teach lighting techniques. This I look forward to because all the video projects I&#39;ve ever done have terrible lighting and it drives me mad. When you&#39;re going for a specific look and it you don&#39;t have the tools or knowledge to make it happen it gets a little disheartening.</p>
<p>At this point we began the degree specific tour. It started out in the room without computers that I mentioned earlier. It had a bunch of art desks. If I had to guess this is where I&#39;ll be taking my art history course. </p>
<p>After that we went into a classroom filled with twenty-four mac pros. Here we were lectured on the art of 2D print and how it relates to the design process such as company logos and product design. Apparently Illustrator is going to be an integreal part of this class. </p>
<p>Once done there we headed off to hear about motion graphics. This is the part that I&#39;m most excited about. They showed a demo reel from an old student there who went on to do commercials for the likes of MTV, Nickelodeon and the like. It was impressive and I&#39;m definitely looking forward to this. Oh, this room was filled with a bunch of Windows computers.</p>
<p>We were then led out by the coolest guy there (very happy and up-beat) and into yet another room with a bunch of Macs. He filled us in on the wonders of the web not only about the designs but the backend (which will be focusing around PHP). Luckily I&#39;ve got a good deal of experience in both those fields so that should be an easy class. Before heading on to the next stop we passed through one of the labs where final projects are done. Apparently we&#39;ll have more or less free license to do what we want there.</p>
<p>Our last stop in campus was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/487495670/">green screen room</a>. They&#39;ve got equipment that replaces green screen in real-time. The guy who did the lecturing here was practically giving lessons on how to use the software.</p>
<p>We then proceeded across the street to what I am currently calling the auditorium. Essentially it&#39;s a concert stage with the lights and the smoke and whatnot. This place is where any bands come to play and put on a show. Here we were luctured on career development and given a speech by the president of the college. If I wanted to I could&#39;ve gone on a behind the scenes tour of all the light control equipment and stuff, but I was hungry so that was the end of the tour for us.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, words really can&#39;t describe how cool this place is. You have to see it (in person) to get how freakin&#39; awesome it really is. The only caveat I see to this all is that I still have to wait five months until I start. It&#39;s going to feel very unsatisfying to go back to cart pushing after this.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say about Orlando (possibly Florida as a whole). The whole place smells like it&#39;s been perfumed. It&#39;s a scent I noticed stepping off the plane. I first thought it was indigineous to the airport but it&#39;s like everywhere. Almost like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefly_planets_and_moons#Miranda">another place</a> we&#39;ve heard about....</p>
<p>Well, that was really, really long so I&#39;ll wrap it up. At noon tomorrow (Eastern time) we depart for Memphis again. Until then, peace out.</p>
