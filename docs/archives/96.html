<p>Not trying to be immodest or anything here, but I think this has to be the best joke I&#39;ve done. And, yes, they really did say that in the stupid movie. I&#39;m still of the mind that that whole movie was all faked to some degree or another (aside from the fact that he gained weight). I mean, his first burger, a double quarter pounder or something, took him nearly an hour or so to eat and then he puked it all up? Talk about a girly man. His name is Morgan, so you know I&#39;m right ;-).</p>

<p>Yes, I drew the entire thing in crayon. Crayola&#39;s, even. 64 count box. On black construction paper. Okay, that&#39;s cool.</p>
<p>Oh, 50 points to the person who can correctly identify the origin of the title.</p>

<p>I mean, hey! Why not? They already have a <a href="http://www.mcphee.com/items/10746.html">Jesus action figure, </a> and there have been religous games. The funny thing about one of those &quot;games&quot; in particular...</p>
<p>I believe it was a Noah game. A nice healthy game for young&#39;ns, only.... you needed a Doom cart to run it.</p>
<p>I actually feel rather... soiled to put this comic up, especially after the <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060911/">one my brother did.</a> Oh, bugger. Screwed again :-P</p>

<p>Yeah, so I bought a PS2. For me, this is a rather huge ordeal because hating the PS2 (or anything Playstation) was like a strange sort of religion. I grew up on Nintendo, everything else was just... well... evil (though, I never had a problem with the xbox, go figure).</p>
<p>So, yeah, I bought a PS2 for Guitar Hero which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. It&#39;s kind of like DDR for your fingers, but also has some really great music to boot. From great oldies to some new stuff (like &quot;All of This&quot; by Shaimus). Currently I&#39;m making my way through hard mode which is quite a challenge (especially when the devil pinky won&#39;t cooperate).</p>
<p>I do have some more stuff in mind for my little PS2 (emphesis on the little as I got a slim). I bought the Gameshark media player for it which&#39;ll stream my videos over the network (very sweet) and, of course, I&#39;ll invest in Guitar Hero 2. And probably the Final Fantasy titles I&#39;ve missed since VI for the SNES (which will always be my favorite, though).</p>
<p>Ah, well, I got a little long winded. Guess I&#39;m enjoying this PS2 thing more than I thought I would ;-).</p>

The guy running the site made it sound like they were all &quot;tricked out&quot;, if you will. Intrigued, I e-mailed him asking what was under the hood. His e-mail, apparently a pre-written response, was a fitting answer to a thread going on in the story&#39;s comments, so I answered them with the text of the e-mail I got.</p>
<p>Enter zulhadm.</p>
<p>Apparently this guy also e-mailed and got the same reply. My comment was digged up, his was dugg down (despite what he may say, my comment was posted way before his). He was mad. So, he started making slanderous remarks, starting out on my own blog:</p>
<p>&quot;Matt you suck. You take other people&#39;s work on digg and pass it as if its your own. Learn RESPECT &quot;</p>
<p>I thought maybe it had something to do with me posting a link on digg of Chris&#39; Reggie Pic of the Week. I had no idea that he&#39;d posted that comment on digg. So, all was good. Until I get an e-mail from senior usb. This guy was so pissed he posted <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Diary_of_a_BAD_programmer">this</a> on digg:</p>
<p><strong>Diary of a BAD programmer</strong></p>
<p>DO NOT HIRE HIM. Known as &quot;Matt Hackmann&quot; to the net community this sketchy, untrustworthy character has no business working in the IT Industry. I added some very relevant information to the following digg story: <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/">http://digg.com/tech_news/</a> Site_hosted_on_two_23_year_old_Lisa2_computers Matt took credit for the added info when it wasn&#39;t his!!!!</p>
<p>So, in the end, he made himself look like a class-A asshole. And all of it over a little comment. Wow, this is one eff-d up world.</p>
