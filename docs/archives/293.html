Tryblithe, owner of <a href="http://www.ctsquare.net">CT Square</a> web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it&#39;s all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it&#39;s much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that&#39;s pretty cool :-)</p>
<p>Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that&#39;s about all there is to report there.</p>
<p>Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That&#39;s right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought &quot;Hey, this looks kind of cool&quot;. But I&#39;ve been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is &quot;We&#39;re coming soon!&quot;, &quot;Almost there...&quot;, &quot;blah blah blah...&quot;. One of their so called &quot;storez&quot; was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here&#39;s is Amazon&#39;s reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:</p>
<p>[quote]&quot;At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
web site.  </p>
<p>Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
their site.&quot;[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, real legit :-P.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Title goes here (best I could do :-P)</h2><time>August 16, 2005</time><div><p>Some interesting things happened today (we had burgers for supper, that in itself makes it interesting ;-)).</p>
<p>Firstly, my Empire game is coming along nicely. I spent most of the afternoon and part of this evening getting the random map generation working. That was a blast :-D. Tomorrow I will actually start building the engine framework. This is the part where I generally choke, but I feel pretty motivated :-). I&#39;ve never really done anything to this degree (and this clean) in C++.</p>
<p>Secondly, I got to evict a wasp nest hanging up in one of the windows. It was kind of cool (and scary). Luckily, we&#39;ve got some nasty spray that kills on contact. A couple of spritzes upwards and it started raining wasps. One tried to retaliate, but then it died ;-).</p>
<p>Thirdly, somebody is coming to see the house tomorrow morning (day 6 on the market, about day 4 for actually having the sign up). So that means more cleaning and evacuation and since school starts locally tomorrow we&#39;re going to be the odd ones out. Figures :-P. But, all in all, I don&#39;t really mind. The more people who look at the house the greater our odds of selling the thing.</p>
<p>It kind of bums me out that Twilight Princess isn&#39;t coming out until next year, but that gives me more time to come up with money ;-). Actually, I seem to have found a direction for me to go. Sometime this year I&#39;ll take the GED and then just spend from then until fall of next year, when I&#39;ll go to a local college to get ready for DigiPen, on a job and saving money. It&#39;s the clearest direction on where to take life I&#39;ve had in a long time.</p>
<p>Well, that was kind of long winded for a change :-P. Before I leave, however, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to Slazer for reading my blog. You&#39;re a cool dude, Slazer ;-). See ya!</p>
