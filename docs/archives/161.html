Haven't made one of these in a while. I was digging through some of my old stuff the other day and found my little comic ideas notebook. I always did like this one and I'm not sure why I never made it. This and [Pikachunks](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54176/) were actually written at the same time and were supposed to "air" back to back. But, anyhoo...

Since I can't use Photoshop anymore and since GIMP sucks I had to ink the comic by hand. BY HAND! Actually, it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Not to say that it is without problems but it works.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/sketcharoo">Sketcharoo!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 24, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Remember that sketch a day routine I suggested last week.

My Guitar Hero guitar. Take special note of the Limozeen and Teen Girl Squad stickers. Okay, they&#39;re kind of hard to see.</p>
<p>Yuna, a la Final Fantasy X</p>
<p>Some teacup from my sisters&#39; tea set.</p>

Mario as seen in Mario Sunshine (an awesome game). I&#39;m really pleased with how that came out. Also, there&#39;s Toad. I wasn&#39;t really trying to get a good shape or anything, I just wanted something to test my new pens out on. Up at the top is a little tuft of hair. Just wanted to practice some hair shading.</p>

Asshole mode... ENGAGED!

**dxprog**
You may bow to me whenever.

**anicro pattern maker**
Anicro sucks ass. You should use [AC Pattern Designer](http://www.dxprog.com/files/acpd.zip)

**honda**
They make cars. Chevy's are better.

**qualities of a cashier should possesed**
Don't be a douche bag. Make sure you redline. Don't let customers walk all over you. Only you have the power to take their money. If you didn't they'd be stealing. Also, try going to school and learning proper grammer. It works wonders.

**hawk**
Is not nearly as cool as an eagle.

**phoenic driver sound**
What the hell? Is somebody driving sound? Mad?

**bad news on full sail recording arts program**
Bad news. You weren't accepted.

**twilight.princess@gmail.com**
You should have bought it when it was up on ebay.

**pedro s got your back**
Yes. Yes he does.

**mikes hard lemonade myspace layouts**
MySpace sucks hard enough without you going and screwing it up with some sort of booze oriented layout.

**fullsail college**
It is the college equivelent of Chuck Norris. It kicks you and all your family's asses.

**full sail horrible**
You misspelled awesome. It's "A W E S O M E", not "H O R R I B L E". No wonder they turned you down.

If this doesn't sufficiently answer what ever it was you were googling obviously you don't know what you're looking for in the first place.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/welcome-googlers">Welcome Googlers!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 21, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>The following are google searches that have turned up my site.
