<p>Ever since I was a wee lad, reading has been more or less a main stay past time of mine. Even before I myself could read (an act I don&#39;t recall learning), books have been a part of my life in some form or fashion. For the next couple of posts - as it&#39;s the best idea I&#39;ve had for a blog post in these weeks of drought - I will do some meandering through time, summoning memories of the books and book related experiences in my life. Also, I&#39;m about to turn another year older, so I&#39;m trying to forget about that by living in the past.</p>
<p>In a manner befitting sitcom television of the 80s and 90s, the bedtime story was an established ritual in my family. Mom and sometimes Dad would read a book or two (or a portion of a book, if it was longer) to us after teeth brushing but before we&#39;d be confined to the late night prison of our room. This went on for quite a while, carried over into the lives of my younger siblings, and is still sometimes revived today. I probably appreciate it in a different light now than I did when I was younger, much the same as family meal time.</p>
<p>A lot of what was read were the usuals that all kids grow up with: Green Eggs and Ham; Goodnight Moon; Go, Dog, Go; Wynken, Blynken, and Nod; etc and so forth. I do particularly recall a set of <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sesame_Street_Library">Sesame Street books</a> that we owned, which also reminds me of the Ernie plushie I had at about that time (incidentally, my favorite character). But, I digress. There were also some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Golden_Books">Little Golden Books</a> in our library. I can still recall the taste of the foiled spines...</p>
<p>Of all the books that were ever read to me, however, there&#39;s one that stands out in my mind as being far and above the others (it also makes a great, heart warming tale to tell): the Hobbit. I don&#39;t recall exactly when this happened (general consensus places me at about 8 or 9), but my dad decided one day that we - then, Jeff, Chris, and myself - needed to experience this grande tale of adventure and theiving. I seem to recall not being enthralled by the idea of being read to initially (I was able to read at the time), but within a couple of chapters (one per night) we were all hooked. This was, of course, long before Lord of the Rings was turned into a theatrical masterpiece, but I&#39;ll be damned if my dad didn&#39;t nail Gollum&#39;s voice before it was even a thought in Andy Serkis&#39; head. This experience left such an impression on my life that I fully plan on doing the same with my own children (regardless of whether they are boys or girls).</p>
<p>Counter to that, my mom read us a few of the Little House on the Prarie books (a personal favorite series of hers). I&#39;ll be honest: there are some okay parts, but as a wild young boy, the on-goings of a girl and her family in no-man&#39;s land didn&#39;t entirely capture my attention (sorry, mom). Luckily for her, she was able to reread these to my sisters recently, who probably enjoyed them more than I did. I was able to listen in on her reading this a few times, and approaching the text with my filthy, adult mind makes for some good times (though, not so much for the person reading aloud. Again, sorry mom).</p>
<p>There are more tales to tell, I&#39;m sure (books we read in school and such), but that&#39;s the beginnings of my literacy life in a nutshell. Next time, I&#39;ll explore the world I opened of my own volition and where it&#39;s lead me today.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-me-of-yore-finale">The Me of Yore - Finale</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 20, 2012</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It&#39;s been a while since I posted a journal entry (or anything, really), and the interestingness of this final journal is drying up. So, I&#39;m going to jump to the most important entry in there; the entry that, looking back on it, in many ways kick started my life on the path that has led me here. Without further ado:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today was the oddest/horrible days of my life. It started off fairly normal. We got ready for Mass and headed off as usual. We drove towards Tulsa in conditioned comfort. We were nearly in town when the van started acting up. Mom ordered everyone out of the van. It wasn&#39;t until I got out until I noticed the smoke billowing off the hood. As we backed away from the van we noticed flames under it. A couple of people from the parish stopped. Some other guy stopped and poked around in the van. Mom and Mary Cook were screaming at him to beat it. By the time the fire truck was passing on the other side the van was engulfed in flames. They did get it out and there stood the blackened courpse of what used to be our mode of transportation. So Jeff, Steve, Maggie and I hitched a ride to the curch with the Howzers. When the others got there, Mr. Howzer drove us home. Next to that nothing else has really happened. Okay, I scraped my knee. But it&#39;s late (and raining) and I&#39;m off to bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Name spelling errata aside, the van burning up was actually a fairly large turning point in family history. I don&#39;t think any one thing that followed is necessarily directly attributable, but it was the &quot;big event&quot; upon which other smaller, but more important events happened very close to.</p>
<p>Shortly after the car barbecue, we got the enormous, <a href="http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/express-1500/2001/">15 passenger van</a> that is now the Hackmobile and also the vehicle with which I learned to drive. With that in our possession, it seemed like we began to do more things within the parish, such as my creating and running of their website (my first real experience doing web work outside of for my own fancy or the YPN) in addition to myself and the two younger brothers behind me becoming <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/attention-span-0/">altar boys</a>.</p>
<p>In all this, I began to get my programming skills known and also begin the long process of shedding my introversion and bringing a level of normality to my social skills (a thing that is still ongoing, it seems). Again, I don&#39;t know if the event of the Crispy Van (as it was later called) is directly involved in any of this, but it was certainly something memorable. But, the fire was not without casualties.</p>
<p>My brother&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/KB-Gear-JamP3-Digital-Player/dp/B000050AVW">JamP3</a> didn&#39;t survive.</p>

<p>Surely this needs <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-year-of-music-now-with-interactive-graphs/">no introduction</a> at this point.</p>
<p>My brother Chris and I are heavy users of my music page to the point that we have &quot;fight&quot; over what songs show up in the trending list. Now, this is a bit difficult because our listening habits are quite different and we have a lot of overlap in music tastes.</p>
<p>Now, if you clicked that link up there (or recall from when that post when up), I log each and every song that is played. This is a never ending source of fun for me as I constantly find new ways of interpreting the data, the <a href="http://music.dxprog.com/dt10.php?year=2012">Dx Top 10</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>That said, it has been some time since I&#39;ve crunched these numbers into some nice graphs, so I thought it would be fun to display our battle for dominance as such. The following data was culled from February to April of this year (where I began accurately tracking who played what). For additional details, hover over a row.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Entry 2 - June 9, 2002</p>
<p>Well I have now been sixteen for twenty-four hours. Nothing special. We went to Mass as usual. Afterward we went to Gardener&#39;s and looked around a while. I found an HTML book for Chris. Mom found an old Catholic text book for a buck. We came home to some stew Dad cooked up. It was really good. After that I played some Dr. Mario. Then I worked up an ASP program to hold my financial stuff. Then we went to bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, there is something to be mentioned here. Gardners, erroneously spelled above, is a local used bookstore. Back in my youth, it was a great place to ogle over almost irrelevant programming books (most of which are actually still at the store today). Nowadays, I ignore the computer section entirely and mostly peruse the manga section ($5 tankoban is a pretty good deal).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 3 - June 10, 2002</p>
<p>An amazing this happened today. I completed every subject in school! I also finished my Mockingbird synopsis. Amazery! And on top of all that, I made it through level twenty of Dr. Mario. I also chatted with &quot;kpyro&quot; on AOL. So over today  was really good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>kypyro was one of the first and only people I ever talked with off the YPN boards and at that it was very brief. I don&#39;t recall why, but I came to distrust him at one point. The only actual person I chat with from those days anymore hadn&#39;t even joined YPN at that point.</p>

I reach the end, there are a few blank pages, and then I see this:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/journal_steve.jpg" alt="" title="The doorway into another realm"></p>
<p>It would seem that while I was away at college, my brother Steve saw fit to claim my property as his own and pour his own thoughts on paper. As payback for soiling my stuff, I will dump the best entries here. HAHA!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 3: 12-3-07</p>
<p>Today was  a regular day.Today on the advent calendar we saw a blind man. Thats it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 5: 12-12-07</p>
<p>Today was hectic. I woke up about 11:00 o clock. We had lunch. Then Mom and me went to pick up Verna. I had to go because Mom wanted to get me some new mass shoes because I had to serve tonight.  Mom bought a 60 pair of shoes. So we went to Wal Mart just in case we could find anything cheaper (and better). We found a pair but we didn&#39;t get them. Then we got me a mass shirt. Then we went. When it was time to go I put on all me new stuff. We got me socks to. Then we went. When we got outside I said shotgun first but didn&#39;t get to sit up front!! &gt;:( !!! When we got to church Mom escorted me to the sacristy. There I put on a cassick, surplice, and a cape. Father Festas was ate so immediately after he got dressed mass started. As we were walking down the aidle deacon Joe noticed that my cape was inside out. Well that really stank. After mass I put out the candles but I didn&#39;t put out the advent wreath candles because I didn&#39;t think I was supposed to. Then we went home. Dad got Taco Bell for supper because we hadn&#39;t had any supper because mass was at 5:15. Then we watched the Santa Claus. While mom and I were shopping everyone made peppermint bark. Well my hand is killing me now so I&#39;ll quit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funnily enough, out of the sixteen entries he wrote, this is the only one that doesn&#39;t end in the phrase &quot;Well, that&#39;s it&quot;.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting (or perhaps disconcerting) is the fact that his prose is nigh identical to my own in my first few entries. Those three word sentences are poetic beauty. Granted, he was only eleven at the time of these writings whereas I was thirteen. Perhaps I was a little behind the curve...</p>
<p>He&#39;s made up for it in the five years since, though. He recently entered a <a href="http://balmoraman.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4thww5">piece</a> into a writing contest held by the local library and took away <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2012/04/friday-at-last/">second place</a> (netting him a not too shabby $50 prize). More than I can say for myself at that age.</p>
<p>At sixteen I was busy destroying the YPN...</p>
