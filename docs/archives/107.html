If you&#39;ve been paying attention to gaming news in the last few hours you&#39;ll know that Sony tried to pull a fast one and copy Nintendo&#39;s motion sensing stuff (a move I called a while back, sadly it wasn&#39;t on the podcast :-P). Also, you&#39;ll know that the cheapest you can get a PS3 for is $500 bucks, and that version doesn&#39;t even come with built-in wifi. I will say this only once: Sony is going to fester in their own turds this next generation.</p>
<p>But on to more current news. Next Monday we&#39;ll finally see the release of the first Mario Bros. game since Yoshi&#39;s Island (1995, I believe). From everything I&#39;ve seen this game is going to be absolutely awesome and from the reviews it seems that it lives up to standards Nintendo set back in the 80s and 90s. I have every intention of picking up my copy Monday.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all for now. Oh, yeah, cashiering rocks ;-). I must try to get some sleep if I expect to be awake for the press conference. Night!</p>

<p>This is one thing I&#39;ve never understood: Why the heck does Smokey Bear wear jeans and no shirt? He&#39;s a bear for crying out loud, he can run around nude :-P. Or if you&#39;re going to clothe <em>half</em> of him, why not the other half? IIRC, 20th Centruy Fox wanted to do the same thing to Chewie.... idiots :-P</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Well, today is the end of the beginning...</h2><time>May 6, 2006</time><div><p>Eh? Whatever :-P</p>
<p>Today, at roughly 4pm CDT, I return to my old job of cashiering. Am I excited? Am I looking forward to it? I&#39;ll just tell you one thing: I&#39;ve saved out my hawaiian SpongeBob shirt just for the occasian (i.e. hell, yes). I just hope I remember how to work the stupid register :-P</p>
<p>In other news, I got the graphics tablet I ordered up on Wednesday and I must say, it is a thing of beauty (and hance a joy forever). Today&#39;s comic was colored and highlighted using it and I have to say it&#39;s probably one of the best things I&#39;ve done so far. About the comic itself it seems that the style <em>is</em> finally coming together (i.e. I&#39;m satisfied with it at the moment). I&#39;ve already got Monday&#39;s comic finished and have ideas for a couple weeks to come. I&#39;m so sucked into this at the moment I barely had time to finish coding the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/">comic viewer</a>. From now on all my updates will be done over there so if you want to keep up on the comics add that to your favorites (I&#39;ll add in an RSS feed sometime within a week).</p>
<p>Also, for those who may not have gotten the hint, I am now legally licensed to drive in the state of Oklahoma. The test was brief, but nerve racking and I was only coached on a couple of minor points. So to date I&#39;ve driven twice on my own: once to take my homies to the library, and last night to take my homies to go bowling (my &quot;homies&quot; being Jeff and Chris). And despite the fact that money keeps slipping through my fingers I&#39;ve got enough of it stored up to make a nice down payment on a car, so that&#39;ll be coming down the road fairly soon (if you&#39;ll pardon the pun).</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve been up for way too long now and I need to get some rest if I&#39;m going to be in decent shape for work this afternoon.</p>

In this episode we mainly ramble on about our thoughts on E3, which starts next Wednesday. Also, we bring you, for the very first time, our &quot;Picks of the Week&quot;. As promised, <a href="http://www.werkema.com/software/spacemonger.html">here&#39;s the link</a> for SpaceMonger. Awesome program, I highly recommend downloading it (or else).</p>
