As the title suggests I own an Xbox 360. Now I can proudly call myself a Wii60 person. I've been wanting one for a while mainyl for the Halo series but also it's extensive online cataloge of awesomeness. For instance I can download HD quality Headlines clips... FREE! It freakin' owns. The only thing that's going to come back to haunt me some day is the small hard drive. I could've bought an Elite but I got a Premium instead. I stupid. I own Crackdown and Halo 2. I was originally just going to rent Crackdown (for the H3 beta of course) but I tried the demo and was like "Hey, this isn't a bad game" so I bought it. Of course, I haven't necessarily been playing these games. No, I've been playing Phoenic Wright 1. It still kicks ass. In fact I'd go so far as to say that case number four was my favorite yet.

Well, I could go on about such things for a long time, but I think I shall get soome sleep.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/and-a-host-of-angels-sang-in-joyous-chorus">And a Host of Angels Sang in Joyous Chorus!</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 4, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Okay, so heaven isn&#39;t rejoicing the fact that I&#39;ve got the site running under good ol&#39; dxprog power but I hate thinking up titles.

**MySpace profiles**. We've given power to these people to change the design of their profiles. Bad idea. Why, you ask? Because it seems a good chunk of the MySpace population doesn't understand the basic fundamentals of good design. Readability is the first thing that comes to mind. Green text against some sort of fractal design background is enough to induce some sort of crack induced brain trip upon those who are to look upon it. I will say this: that horrible piece of shit you call a MySpace profile layout doesn't necessarily reflect upon you as a person. I say this because I've got friends and family on MySpace. In closing, though, you can't expect the users of a place where they themselves have... questionable design practices to be better.

**Carts**. Don't be a douche bag. Put the fracking carts in a damn cart corral. Never, EVER put your carts up on a curb or on the grass. I will kill you. Slowly.

**Grammar**. Has this completely gone out the window? Seriously, since the advent of instant messaging and e-mail everybody's grammar and spelling are simply atrocious. Their, there, and they're are one of the worst offenders. Nobody knows how to properly spell angel (many times transposing the "e" and the "l"). Nobody cares. And to think is the next generation of human being that we will have to hand the keys of the world off to when my generation gets old. It sends shivers up my spine.

Well, I think that covers most bases. If I haven't offended you please feel free to e-mail me and I'll do my best to correct said situation next time I rant. Peace out!</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/in-and-of-ranting">In and of Ranting</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 1, 2007</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Since there&#39;s not much to write about that&#39;s happening in my life at this current point in time I will instead rant on a cornucopia of things.
