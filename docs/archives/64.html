But, I digress.

It actually was quite the learning experience as I&#39;d not done coloring of this caliber before and I got a lot of things figured out.

</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1">Two Years of Anime - Part 1</a></h2><time>December 26, 2009</time><div><p>Here begins three articles of anime reviews. Yes, I know I said two in the previous post, but after creating the list I realized it would be more prudent to split this into three. This also allows me to kind of categorize things and I&#39;ll kick the list off with cute and romantic comedies. Another thing to note is that my criteria have changed. The movies and video games were all things <em>released</em> in 2008-2009. These are all things I <em>watched</em> in those years. So, without further ado, here is part one of my anime reviews.</p>
<h2 id="midori-days">Midori Days</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_midori_days.jpg" alt="" title="Midori Days">
<em>Midori Days</em> falls into the latter of the aforementioned categories. The premise is absolutely rediculous opening with protagonist Sawamura Seiji waking up one day to find that a tiny girl, Kasugano Midori, has replaced his right hand. Oddly enough, even though the show indulges in more fan service than any other I&#39;ve watched, there was never a raunchy moment, something I thought odd considering the premise. The overall story follows these two as Midori tries to win over Seiji who is otherwise distracted by just about every other woman within eyesight... except the ones that actually like him. The show is full of plenty of laughs and feel good moments and I&#39;d certainly recommend watching it if you are interested in the genre. <strong>7/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="lucky-star">Lucky Star</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_lucky_star.jpg" alt="" title="Lucky Star">
One of my earlier forays into anime, Lucky Star is.... well, I&#39;m not entirely sure. Sure, it follows a group of high school girls, but that&#39;s about it. It follows these girls unusual conversations about various pop-culture, day-to-day things and Japanese culture references. Because of the Japan centric themes, I have a difficult time following being American. As the show goes on, these jokes and references become more mainstream, but the show itself is just random conversation. The only thing that really kept me watching was the cute artwork (I&#39;m secure enough in my manhood to admit that). <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="ichigo-mashimaro">Ichigo Mashimaro</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_ichigo_mashimaro.jpg" alt="" title="Ichigo Mashimaro">
<em>Ichigo Mashimaro</em>, or <em>Strawberry Marshmallow</em>, is in pretty much the same vein as <em>Lucky Star</em>, except drop the age of the girls to twelve and remove most of the pop-culture/Japan/etc references. What makes <em>Ichigo</em> better than <em>Lucky Star</em>, in my opinion, is that it&#39;s far more universal in its ramblings. For example, in the first episode, the girls all try to stay up late making a birthday gift for one of the girls&#39; sister. This is something I can relate to as my bros and I have done this before, only for our parents. It&#39;s a cute take on the slice-of-life genre and I certainly enjoyed watching it. Oh, and it has one of the best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzGbA1ov_WE">Engrish scenes</a> ever. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="karin">Karin</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_karin.jpg" alt="" title="Karin">
I do not like Vampires or anything Halloween related, even more so now that vampires are gay, angsty teenagers who sparkle in the sunlight. That said, the titular character of <em>Karin</em> is a vampire. Or rather, she&#39;s an un-vampire, injecting blood into her victims instead of the other way around. This is an interesting little romantic comedy that I didn&#39;t like initially but came to really enjoy. Througout its twenty-four episodes, it never really deviates too much from the main plot; that is, developing the relationship between Karin and her classmate Usui Kenta. The last couple of episodes are certainly intense and will leave you wondering what path the show will take. So, even with my general dislike for occultish things, <em>Karin</em> is worth a watch. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="bokusatsu-tenshi-dokuro-chan">Bokusatsu Tenshi - Dokuro-chan</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_bokusatsu_tenshi.jpg" alt="" title="Bokusatsu Tenshi - Dokuro-chan">
Remember when I said that I was convering cute things and romantic comedies? <em>Bokusatsu Tenshi</em> is neither of those. It&#39;s straight up, almost slapstick style comedy, something I&#39;d associate more with western cartoons. The basic premise of the story is that Dokuro, an angel from the future, has been sent to stop protagonist Sakura from creating a pedophile world; that is, a world in which all women stop aging at twelve. This only really comes into play in the first episode and everything else is just random situations. Oh, did I mention that Dokuro often kills Sakura in the most bloody and rediculous manner and then brings him back to life? There are a lot of really hilarious moments in this show and it saddens me that it only runs a handful of episodes. Perhaps that&#39;s for the best, though. <strong>7/10</strong>
So, there is the first wave of reviews. Next week I&#39;ll be covering more generic shounen stuff. What is week three you may ask? That, my friend, is a surprise.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-video-game-reviews">Two Years of Video Game Reviews</a></h2><time>December 24, 2009</time><div><p>It is time now for the second wave of &#39;08/&#39;09 reviews with today&#39;s column covering video games.</p>
<h2 id="star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2008-xbox-360-">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008, Xbox 360)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_force_unleashed.jpg" alt="" title="Star Wars: The Force Unleashed">
There was quite a bit of hype surrounding this game when it came out. It was supposed to be a Star Wars IP that the world hadn&#39;t seen since <em>Shadows of the Empire</em>. Did it live up to the hype? Depends on who you ask. I didn&#39;t buy it until recently, but I definitely had fun playing it. That said, there were also many points where I was frustrated out of my mind to the point of controller throwing (something I&#39;ve not done in years). Some of this was due to faulty game mechanics, but mostly my own incompetence. Sadly, the game is fairly repetitive in terms of combat and I found myself relying on Force lightning to handily finish off every enemy I came across. There are plenty of options for combat such as push and choke and, of course, your lightsaber, but none of these were as handy or wholly satisfying as lightning. Oh, and for all the hype about Euphoria, never once did I see a stormtrooper <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/2/1/">grab another in mid air</a>. <strong>7/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="animal-crossing-city-folk-2008-wii-">Animal Crossing: City Folk (2008, Wii)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_animal_crossing.jpg" alt="" title="Animal Crossing: City Folk">
The ever successful Animal Crossing franchise made its way onto the Wii last fall and... it&#39;s Animal Crossing. It keeps a lot of things from its DS pedecessor such as the rolling log world, but also brings back things sorely missed from the GameCube version such as separate houses for each player. The graphics have finally received a much needed bump, especially in the area of textures. The models, however, still remain fairly low-poly in some instances and the lighting isn&#39;t really helping anything in that department. Some things have been handled better than they were in the first game, such as moving some of the random occurances to permanent stores within the city. All in all, <em>City Folk</em> just as fun and addictive as the original (110 hours of play doesn&#39;t lie), though I am slightly disappointed that it wasn&#39;t changed up more. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="apollo-justice-ace-attorney-2008-ds-">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (2008, DS)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_apollo_justice.jpg" alt="" title="Apollo Justice">
After three highly successful (and truly amazing) Phoenix Wright games, Apollo Justice comes in to fill the shoes of the pointy-haired defense attorney that preceeded him. <em>Apollo Justice</em> is the first <em>Ace Attoreny</em> game designed specifically for the DS and they came up with some interesting ways to utilize the hardware. The cutscenes are fancier and the artwork is higher color, but it feels very much the same. The court scenes haven&#39;t really changed, though a new dynamic similar to Psyche-locks has been added. The stories are everythig you&#39;d expect from the series making <em>Apollo Justice</em> worthy of the <em>Ace Attorney</em> title. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="resident-evil-5-2009-xbox-360-">Resident Evil 5 (2009, Xbox 360)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_resident_evil_5.jpg" alt="" title="Resident Evil 5">
I&#39;ve never played any of the <em>Resident Evil</em> games before, but when a college buddy brought it over I played co-op with him. Surprisingly, it was a really fun game. The controls worked well and there were always plenty of zombies around to shoot. Granted, some areas kind of sucked balls, such as the boat trip through the swamp, collecting all the crystals in that temple/cave thing and, of course, the damned quick time events. But, those aside, it looked and played very nice and offered a couple days of gaming fun. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="mad-world-2009-wii-">Mad World (2009, Wii)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_mad_world.jpg" alt="" title="Mad World">
I&#39;ll say this up front: paying $50 for this game without having played it first was a mistake. I was hooked by the uniqueness of the look and the idea that somebody was actually going to make something uniquely tailored to the Wii without being kiddie shovelware. It does look interesting, but upon close perusal, the graphics don&#39;t hold up. I didn&#39;t really know where the hell I was going half the time, and, while there are some unique ways to kill people, it was easier just to button mash. The interstitials with the pimp guy were kind of funny and John DiMaggio is always evntertaining, but there wasn&#39;t any content to keep me playing. With a whole two hours of play time, I wound up trading it in. <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="scribblenauts-2009-ds-">Scribblenauts (2009, DS)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_scribblenauts.jpg" alt="" title="Scribblenauts">
This is becoming a sad list of overhyped disappointments. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, under the surface of Scribblenauts lies an incredibly clever and inventive game. With a list of some 20,000+ objects you can call upon to complete various puzzles, there&#39;s a world of promise here. However, the execution was less than stellar. The objectives were generally vague, leaving me scratching my head as for what to do and when they weren&#39;t, I found myself solving most puzzles with a rope and helicoptor.The biggest offender, however, was the controls. The character and placement of items is all controlled via touchscreen and, if you are not very specific about where you click, you&#39;ll wind up careening to an untimely death. Honestly, the title screen for <em>Scribblenauts</em> was probably the funnest part, being just a sandbox with which you can do whatever you want. I was so hopeful for this game and I hope that the developers take a step back, realize where they fucked up, and try it again. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="rhythm-heaven-2009-ds-">Rhythm Heaven (2009, DS)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_rhythm_heaven.jpg" alt="" title="Rhythm Heaven">
It should be no secret at this point that I am a fan of rhythm games, but Rhythm Heaven is a unique and extremely fun take on the genre. There are dozens of mini-games based around two simple control guestures: touch and flick. It&#39;s so simple, yet you&#39;ll put in a crazy amount of hours if you want to get golds and perfects on each song. Speaking of which, this game has one of the funnest soundtracks I&#39;ve heard in a while. Granted, not every one is a hit (espcially the localization of the sung tracks), but it&#39;ll always get your toes (and stylus) tapping. The art style and mini-games themselves are reminiscent of Wario Ware and is both fun and outlandish. There&#39;s plenty for everybody here and I&#39;d definitely recommend picking up a copy if you own a DS. <strong>10/10</strong>
Of all these games, the Game of the Years award would hands down go to Rhythm Heaven. It&#39;s just so damned addictive and fun. Keep your eyes peeled as I&#39;ll wind up this series of reviews with a two parter covering all the anime I watched this year.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-reviews">Two Years of Reviews</a></h2><time>December 19, 2009</time><div><p>The year is beginning to wind down and Christmas is just around the corner. I&#39;ve consumed quite a lot of media this year, from my newfound addiction to anime and the usual domestic shows and video games. Over the next couple of weeks, I&#39;m going to review what I considered to be the best of the best in each genre. Today, I&#39;ll start off with movies. I&#39;m going to fudge a little bit and include movies released last year as well, otherwise this would be a really short list.</p>
<h2 id="the-incredible-hulk-2008-">The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_incredible_hulk.jpg" alt="" title="The Incredible Hulk">
Honestly, I just watched this movie for the first time tonight. I will preface by saying that I really didn&#39;t have any issues with the 2003 film and saw the reboot of a reboot so close together a little ridiculous. However, that aside, the new film was enjoyable. I didn&#39;t love this film, nor did I hate it. It&#39;s pretty much the basic tale of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk and how he attempted to cope with it. There&#39;s plenty of action to go along with the story and everything flows well. One thing I will pick on, however, was how bad the CGI in this film was. At times I felt like I was watching something that had been rendered with the UT3 engine and there was even a scene where the green screen keying failed to suspend my disbelief. <strong>7/10 </strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="iron-man-2008-">Iron Man (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_iron_man.jpg" alt="" title="Iron Man">
The second super hero movie on this list. Unlike <em>Hulk</em>, though, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing film. Again, it&#39;s another origins tale detailing how weapons designer and super genius Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and his adventures as such. What really makes this movie work so well is Stark and how he is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. His playboy asshole persona is enough to make you say &quot;what a dick&quot; and yet still be completely likeable. Some criticize this movie for its lack of action, but this was never a problem for me. We see plenty of Iron Man flying around and blowing things up, but it&#39;s the character development that really shines. The only negative to this movie is the lack of a really strong antagonist. Finally, if you buy the DVD, splurge on the special edition version as it has some really good documentaries (best I&#39;ve seen since Star Wars II). <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="wall-e-2008-">Wall-E (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_wall_e.jpg" alt="" title="Wall-E">
Andrew Stanton once again takes the helm of the Pixar engine after a three movie reprieve since <em>Finding Nemo</em> to deliver another wholly wonderful experience worthy of both the Pixar name and his reputation. I think Ben Burtt, sound designer for both this film and, more notably, the <em>Star Wars</em> films, accurately described <em>Wall-E</em> as &quot;R2 the Movie&quot;. It follows the story of one garbage robot, Wall-E, as he is whisked away from a garbage-apocalyptic Earth and finds love and adventure amongst the stars. To pull off a film in which none of the main protagonists really talk, and do it so well, is a testament to both Stanton and Burtt&#39;s abilities. Everything about this film just oozes cute and feel good, but it&#39;s the first twenty or so minutes that really shine, both from a story telling standpoint but most especially from the art direction. The desolation of Earth is sold so well and the score underlines the mood perfectly. There is the environmental subtext, but I never found it so prominent as to be off-putting. <em>Wall-E</em> ties for first with Nemo as my favorite Pixar film of all time. <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="kung-fu-panda-2008-">Kung Fu Panda (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_kung_fu_panda.jpg" alt="" title="Kung Fu Panda">
I was expecting <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> to be a huge pile of crap. After having seen the trailers on TV time and again, I hated this movie before it had even hit theaters. After some prodding by friends, I grudgingly went to see it and thank heavens I did. There is so much to love about KFP. It&#39;s the story of a nredy, fat, noodle-making panda - Po - who is chosen to as the prophesied &quot;dragon warrior&quot; that will rid the world of the evil Tai Lung. The story and humor are excellent, the visuals and art direction are stunning and, for a kids movie, it has a lot of superbly executed action pieces. The opening sets the mood for the film so well and Jack Black does a spectacular job voicing Po, adding just enough of his personality to the character without overdoing it. There are plenty of genuinely humorous moments in the film and amazingly never resorts to fart jokes. Finally, the score is absolutely fantastic with many Asian motifs playing through and setting the tone for the film quite excellently. This is the first CG animated film that I would dare to put on par with any Pixar fare and it does so with flying colors. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="wanted-2008-">Wanted (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_wanted.jpg" alt="" title="Wanted">
This was another film that I was talked into seeing. Sadly, it&#39;s largely forgettable. The plot is so bizarre that I was never really sold on it and thus tainted the rest of the experience. A machine weaving binary messages into cloth? Please. The MythBusters episode where they tackled the curving bullets - one of the major elements to this film - was more entertaining. However, this is meant to be simply an action flick and I suppose it passes as that. <em>Die Hard</em> it is not, though. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="star-trek-2009-">Star Trek (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_star_trek.jpg" alt="" title="Star Trek">
SPOILERS AHEAD, YE BE WARNED. This was one of two films that I was really looking forward to seeing this year and honestly the only one that I was really hyped about. I even went to see it on opening weekend, the only other film to have that honor was Revenge of the Sith. What I received was, in my opinion, an enjoyable action flick but a poor <em>Trek</em> movie. The way that Abrams (whom I will address in just a moment) decided to rewrite the story was fine in theory, but came off as wholly unbelievable. Why would the cataclysmic battle at the beginning of the film so drastically change things in the design world (I.e. ship design, interfaces, etc)? How is it even possible that those characters would wind up in the same positions on the same ship as in the previous timeline? And what was with Uhura&#39;s random spontaneous thing for Spock? I was waiting for the reset button to be pressed at the end of the movie, but was depressed when there was none. Star Trek has never been entirely action oriented opting instead for more situationally based, cerebral stories. However, what we got in this was another over CGed affair with more eye candy than brain food. And, while I&#39;m on the subject, a direct message to Mr. Abrams:
They invented the tripod for a reason. It&#39;s so the camera isn&#39;t shaky. My vision is blurry enough without you giving camera control to Michael J. Fox (no offense, Mr. Fox). And all that lens flare and bloom? This isn&#39;t the 90&#39;s. They aren&#39;t cool, they don&#39;t add anything, so stop using them.
While being critically acclaimed, I do not believe that this film holds a candle to most of the even-numbered films in the series and place it on par with Nemesis (my least favorite). If you want a really good TOS <em>Star Trek</em> movie, my pick would be <em>Undiscovered Country</em>. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="up-2009-">Up (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_up.jpg" alt="" title="Up">
Much like <em>Cars</em>, the premise for _Up_ had me worried. The trailer only mildly interested me at best (though it looked great in 3D). Sadly, unlike <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>, it didn&#39;t do anything to sway my opinion in the other direction. The story follows an old man who attaches a crap ton of balloons to his house and flies to South America. While the opening few minutes of the movie are probably some of the best cinema has ever seen, the story that follows is simply to bizarre and disjointed. I didn&#39;t really find myself attached to any of the characters&#39; plights or that I even cared for them much. However, that said, this movie does offer up quite a bit in terms of comedy, especially through the character of Dug. There&#39;s really not much else to say about the film except maybe that Michael Giacchino&#39;s score was well-suited and enjoyable. This ranks second to last on my Pixar list, right about <em>Cars</em>. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="coraline-2009-">Coraline (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_coraline.jpg" alt="" title="Coralina">
Here&#39;s a deceptive one. &quot;From the director of Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was what they touted in the trailers and spots, knowing that most people think Tim Burton directed said movie. Well, he didn&#39;t and he had no involvement on this film (thank God). Based on the popular children&#39;s novel of the same name, <em>Coraline</em> is a thoroughly wonderful and enjoyable film. Coraline Jones finds herself in a new and strage house with a room containing a small doorway leading to many a fantastical adventure. It is unique but at the same time twisted and I believe that the way they translated the book to the screen worked very well (despite taking some liberties). What really shines in <em>Coraline</em>, though, is the animation. Stop motion is certainly not very favorable these days, what with CG being much faster and cheaper. However, what they&#39;ve pulled off in this movie is absolutely stunning and even more so when you watch it in 3D (like I was able to in the theater). I personally will be rooting this film for Best Animated Picture when Oscar season rolls around. <strong>9/10</strong>
If I had to choose which of these films I believe was best, I think the award would go to <em>Iron Man</em>. Everything about it is just so enjoyable and watching Downey Jr&#39;s performance is an absolute treat, something you don&#39;t see in cinema too often anymore.
Check back in a few days when I review video games from the last two years.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle">The Digg Debacle</a></h2><time>November 23, 2009</time><div><p>To say my October was an interesting one would be like saying that the sun is hot or that I&#39;m sick and tired of hearing about Twilight. There were numerous things that made it interesting, from my going to the Tulsa State Fair to sitting teaching myself HTML 5. However, the highlight of that month was my trip to San Francisco to interview with Digg.[break]</p>
<p>Somewhere towards the beginning of the month I had gotten an e-mail from Jobvite about a new Digg position as I am wont to do. The difference between this e-mail and the others was that I was actually qualified for the job in question. Without hesitating, I fired out my resume and cover letter but didn&#39;t really expect anything to come of it. After all, we&#39;re talking about one of the most visited websites in the world and certainly they&#39;d want somebody with real working experience (of which I really did not have).</p>
<p>But, to make a long story short, I got a call from the recruiter (while I was at aforementioned fair) and that interview went well. I was then setup to talk to one of the developers and interview with him. That interview also went well. Then began the week of craziness.</p>
<p>I had received an e-mail from the recruiter saying &quot;We&#39;d like to bring you out here for more interviews.&quot; I was, of course, more than a little excited at this proposition. I e-mailed back asking when so I could get tickets lined up and got a reply saying &quot;Oh, I forgot you were in Oklahoma. Well, we&#39;ll shoot for this date and time.&quot;</p>
<p>So. after a quick trip to Expedia, I had my tickets and hotel lined up shortly after which I received another e-mail stating that &quot;I need to get approval first.&quot; A dashing blow to be sure, but luckily this was brought to light fast enough that I could cancel my tickets without incurring any fees.</p>
<p>The next day or so dragged on as I waited to hear again about whether or not I would be interviewing. The answer was yes, a date was set and again I had my tickets ready to do. Then came a call saying &quot;Oh, hey. There&#39;s a developer meeting on the day you&#39;re having your interview. How about the day after?&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if this were any other company than Digg I may have said &quot;Really? If you can&#39;t get it together I&#39;m not going to bother.&quot; But, this was Digg and this was a dream job, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and cancelled/repurchased my tickets. Yes, I&#39;m at seven paragraphs and I&#39;ve yet to set foot on a plane.</p>
<p>Luckily, this was the end of the planning Hell and in a couple days I was on the plane flying out to the City by the Bay. I was excited to finally be moving forward with this. My plane left Tulsa at 6am cdt and arrived in San Fran at 11:40pdt, the entire time dressed in my interviewing clothes.</p>
<p>Now, on this last set of tickets I passed on both a car and hotel as these tickets were much more expensive due to the short notice. So, I hitched a ride on the train to some street close to the Digg offices and hiked the rest of the way. Initially, it took a while to get pointed in the right direction as everybody I asked on the street around the train station did not seem to know where any street was. Eventually, I did get there (after about a mile of walking in the San Francisco heat) and just in time. I entered the building with a bunch of developers who were coming off lunch and entered the Digg lobby.</p>
<p>The lobby is pretty much what I expected: trendy and slick. There were two couches with little digg pillows on them and a big digg sign on the wall. I checked in, signed an NDA, and began the actual interview. And a whirlwind that was.</p>
<p>Over the four hours of interviews I had I think I learned more than in my entire time at Full Sail. I was thrown all sorts of questions ranging from how to avoid duplicate entires in a database caused by two users submitting the same thing at the exact same time, to how to get paid even amounts of gold for a job over the course of seven days without cutting said bar more than two times. In the end, I was neutral about the interview as a whole; some went well some not so well. I didn&#39;t know what to expect as I exited the building.</p>
<p>The trip home was long as I had to stay overnight in the San Francisco smelling like sweat due to all the walking I had done that day. It was not pleasant to say the least and I apologize to any passenger who had the misfortune of sitting next to me. But, I figured if I got a job at Digg it would all be worth it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week where I finally received an e-mail from the recruiter saying that they had passed up on hiring anybody for the position at all. I&#39;m not too angry or disappointed as I am now employed with Griffin New Media and I did get an experience I&#39;ll remember for a good many years to come. Perhaps in the future I&#39;ll have the opportunity again and maybe will have a little more luck then.</p>
