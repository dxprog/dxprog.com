<p>Anyways, I have good news! And, no, I didn&#39;t save a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico. No, it seems that my laptop has FINALLY been repaired (going on over a month now, I believe). From the repair center: &quot;repaired- replaced fl inverter, fixed latch,and cleaned heatsink,very&quot;. It seems I got everything I asked for and thensome, though the  heatsink was very what? Very big? Very sexy? Very... whatever?! I dunno.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I finally managed to snag that which I have been seeking my entire life. The very purpose of man&#39;s existance. The driving force of all creatures... a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44121975@N00/191885027/">Super Nintendo Entertainment System!!</a> (in box, even). Of course, no SNES is complete without the greatest game ever made... FINAL FANTASY VI!!! Ah, the sweet, sweet days of care free gaming, when all was right in the world.... it&#39;s a pity those days are gone.</p>
<p>Ah, well. I shall be off with sweet dreams of snes&#39;s and laptops in my head :-)</p>
