As you can see the archives list is now sorted in descending order and I also have a little links bar (I can add as many side bars as I want too :-)). Also, fixed a few problems in the message board code and cleaned up a couple other things that had been bothering me for months.</p>
<p>I got my USBC card today which brings to to the following important note: tomorrow is bowling again. YAY! After that I&#39;ll be working three days and then get Saturday off. YAY! Then I&#39;ll work Sunday and I&#39;ll be off again. YAY! (I &#39;spect that&#39;s getting annoyiing :-P).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all I wanted to say. But before I go I&#39;ll give a shout out to my coworker buddy, Blake! :-D See ya :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s official... I check people out for a living</h2><time>January 7, 2006</time><div><p>And checking out hot babes is fun ;-). No, really. Yesterday my job code was officially changed to cashier so now, uhh.... it&#39;s official :-P. Today was my first 8 hour day doing cashier and what what a day it was. Standing in one spot and constantly leaning over to reach people&#39;s stuff takes a nasty toll on your back. And when you&#39;ve been waiting 40 minutes for the managers to send you home it&#39;s even worse :-P. But, overall, I quite enjoy the job (a lot of button pushing ;-)). Tomorrow I work six hours and then, hallelujah, I&#39;m off Monday and Tuesday :-D.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672326612/qid=1136691749/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4/103-2137882-6907848?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">3D game programming book</a> came the other and it&#39;s really a good book. It&#39;s actually written by one of the guys on the DirectX dev team so you know it&#39;s at least accurate :-P. But really, if you&#39;re starting out 3d game programming look into this book.</p>
<p>Lastly, last night I ordered up a (legit) copy of Yoshi&#39;s Island GBA so that should be coming some time next week. I look forward to playing that on my lunch breaks :-).</p>
<p>Yes, it seems my life nhas boiled down to two things: work and programming. But, heck, at least I&#39;m malking money (getting a few hundred dollar paycheck every two weeks rocks ;-)). Until next time, keep those prices rollin&#39;!</p>
