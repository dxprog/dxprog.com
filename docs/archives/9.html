At that time, I took this picture:</p>

<p>While I was visiting folks in September, I found my old vests back (which is to say my brother had held on to them all this time). Having hauled them back to the Bay with me, I decided that I&#39;d dress up as old cashier Matt for Halloween and wore the vest to work. Here&#39;s that same picture updated for modern times:</p>

<p>Looking back, I realized I was quite proud to be working at that store. Moreso than anything, I was probably just happy to have a job, but looking back on it, there was something to be proud of. During my not-quite-two years there, I went from quiet coder to a sociable person who could hold his own in the world. I worked in almost every department in the store in an attempt to be one of the most versitible people there. It was also slightly self-serving in that it allowed me to do something slightly different a lot, but that shit looks amazing in the eyes of management. I topped out at cashier &quot;management&quot;, which is really just ensuring the front-end was well manned and that cashiers get their breaks/lunch on time, gaining me the coveted red coat. It didn&#39;t last, as I went to cart pusher for the last few months there, but in retrospect, I&#39;m pretty proud of what I accomplished in the little time I was there.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a luxurious job, but I&#39;ll treasure what that time meant to me... always.</p>

<p>As was touched upon previously, I am the owner of a shiny CNC machine.</p>

<p>This thing excites the hell out of me because I basically have a tiny little wood shop robot that can make art, and parts, and gifts, and who knows what else. There&#39;s only one thing complicating the matter</p>

<p>Turns out it&#39;s not as simple as saying &quot;print&quot; like my 3D printer. No, there&#39;s much to know about endmills, feed rates, router speeds, plunge rates, and a whole plethora of maths and terminology. In the above, I tried to make a grid of holes, but these all failed in various ways. The holes were all lopsided and, towards the end of the milling operation, the whole router would take this weird turn too early and would chew up the rest of the work. I was confused and getting a bit frustrated and down on the whole thing.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am not the only one throwing a CNC party. In fact, I&#39;m the last one on the bandwagon. Between myself and a couple of other coworkers, we&#39;re kind of trudging through this world together, exchanging knowledge and tidbits as we learn them. It was during these CNC talk lunches that I overheard what my problem might be.</p>
<p>Check the belt tension.</p>

<p>Well, that fixed everything. There&#39;s still some things to consider like non-manual dust collection (I currently follow the router with a vacuum hose) and contraptions to hold the stock material down. But, you&#39;ve gotta admit. That hunk of cherry is a sexy piece of wood. Let&#39;s have another glamour shot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now stoked to start making a bunch of cool shit. Perhaps we&#39;ll being seeing more on the blog this month :O</p>
