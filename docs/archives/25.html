Following that, I will also document my thoughts and adventures on living in the famous Bay Area (lots of pictures &#39;n shit).</p>
<p>The ball that got this whole thing rolling was a simple email I received somewhere in mid-January. It was from a recruiter who thought that my skills might match a position they had open. Now, I&#39;ve gotten several of these every month for the last couple years, to which I generally politely decline and proceed with my life (except that one time where I accepted and went to Winnercomm). The difference here was that this email was from LinkedIn and the job was also at LinkedIn, something far more awesome and legit than a random offer Kazhim. I immediately consulted one of my coworkers whom I shall refer to as &quot;Kairu&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>me:</strong> Just got a job &quot;feeler&quot; to work for Linkedin
<strong>Kairu:</strong> to work for linkedin?
<strong>me:</strong> for
<strong>Kairu:</strong> damn son
<strong>Kairu:</strong> damn
<strong>me:</strong> yeah...
<strong>Kairu:</strong> welp, see ya later
<strong>Kairu:</strong> where is it?
<strong>me:</strong> Mountain View
<strong>me:</strong> CA&#39;
<strong>Kairu:</strong> col?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> ah
<strong>Kairu:</strong> figured
<strong>me:</strong> sme as google, iirc
<strong>me:</strong> *same
<strong>Kairu:</strong> going for an interview?
<strong>me:</strong> I... I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t expecting this
<strong>Kairu:</strong> what did they say?
<strong>me:</strong> I suspect it&#39;s a mass mailing, but still
<strong>me:</strong> I forwarded it to you
<strong>Kairu:</strong> Gondor has called for aid
<strong>Kairu:</strong> Will you answer it?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> It is indeed a mass mailing, but i would still respond. you never know what is down that path, and personally, i think you should check it out
<em>--- time passes ---</em>
<strong>Kairu:</strong> why arent you on the phone right now
<strong>me:</strong> because I&#39;m working?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> well you aint working on getting a massive fucking promotion
<strong>me:</strong> ...
<strong>Kairu:</strong> :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As can be seen, I wasn&#39;t exactly leaping for joy. My feelings at the time were more that a huge fucking train had just rammed itself through the quiet temple that was my life. I honestly considered just ignoring the email entirely or declining as was my norm. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that nothing would come of anything and (with some egging from Kairu), I responded with interest in the position.</p>
<p>With that response, the waves of interviews began. I had an initial phone interview with the recruiter just talking about the position and LinkedIn and to ensure I was interested. After that was a simple technical phone screen, where a room of devs questioned me on various basic web dev topics. I thought I had failed at that point because I had trouble understanding the devs, due in part to them being on speaker, thick accents, and me being in the lobby of a busy building on my cell phone. I kept asking them to repeat and felt that my answers somehow came up short.</p>
<p>But, that wasn&#39;t the end (obviously). A few days later, I had a phone session where I talked to a couple of devs and they watched me write code via an online collaborative text editor. I felt a whole lot more confident about this interview than the previous one because I was at home on the phone with ear buds (these make me more awesome at phoning in general, not sure why) and also had a code editor in front of me. I don&#39;t rely on autocomplete for coding, but I have an easier time visualizing things when I can type it. Two of these types of interviews I did (back to back) and I again waited for a response.</p>
<p>And their response was &quot;we&#39;re going to fly you out for more interviews&quot;. Obviously, this is a big step because the cost of booking a flight, hotel, and car is not cheap (to me, at least) and if they were going to do that, they were serious. All I could think of, though, was my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">interview with Digg back in 2009</a> and how horrible that went and how green I was compared to everybody else. With that in my mind, I kept waiting for the details of flight information, but it was not forthcoming. I worried that perhaps _I_ was supposed to set everything up (as I had at Digg), but as it turned out an email slipped through the cracks. I called to make sure everything was still on (the day before I needed to fly out) and it was all taken care of over the phone. Because of the last minute-ness of booking, I even got an extra evening in Mountain View.</p>
<p>The flight itself was more or less uneventful. This time I had an evening before hand to prepare and, more importantly, shower. I had a car, so I wasn&#39;t going to have to ask strangers to direct me and make a trek in the hot sun in my interview clothes. I even dressed &quot;down&quot; a bit for the interview itself, wearing jeans, a button down, and a jacket. I&#39;d been around the block enough times at this point that I felt pretty confident in how &quot;loose&quot; I would be able to present myself, both in appearance and tone. I was feeling nervous, as I am any time I meet people for the first time, but I was mostly confident about the interview itself.</p>
<p>And sure enough, things went very, very well. I had four or five interviews where I was asked code certain things on the wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor whiteboards. It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d be fun, but I really enjoyed taking everything &quot;back to basics&quot; as it were. Everybody I interviewed with was very friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy working for the company, which is a good impression to leave on one who may be employed there. I lunched with some of my interviewers at the company cafeteria (they had pizza that day) and we shot the shit about all manner of things. Honestly, nearly all of my apprehension was gone within the first five minutes of the first interview and I must say that I even enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>My entire day of interviewing lasted about six hours total and, since I had the entire evening free, I had asked the last person I interviewed with (who is now my boss boss) what I might do to kill the remainder of my day. He suggested a bar called 21st Amendment in San Francisco. And go to that bar I did and it was delicious. (Never thought bleu cheese would work on a hamburger.) It was a great way to cap off the day.</p>
<p>Even being there only two days, it was kind of sad to return home as I had caught the glimmer of what my life might become. But, that&#39;s how that goes and I just had to await their final decision. Now, even though I felt all of my interviews had gone well, I was split 50/50 on whether the job would actually be offered to me. So, when the recruiter emailed and said she&#39;d like to talk, I became even more apprehensive.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, I was offered the job and even though I was pretty certain I was going to take it (especially after she had listed off compensation and the benefits package), I slept on it for a weekend. Maybe it was just to make peace with myself and the situation, maybe it was to give the outward impression that I was doing to responsible thing and carefully considering the journey upon which I was about to embark. I dunno.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it&#39;s all kind of crazy. I entered 2013 with the idea that nothing new or momentous was going to happen, maybe some more dating but really just living life on cruise control.</p>
<p>A single email changed all of that.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/accountability-report-a-return-to-shaming">Accountability Report - A Return to Shaming</a></h1><time class="post__published">May 14, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/alcatraz.jpg" alt="" title="The feeling is similar"></p>
<p>It&#39;s been quite some time. About a month and a half, apparently. Now that I&#39;m slowly easing into life in <em>Cali</em>, it&#39;s time for the Accountability Report to return. Posts about me living here, the process of getting here, and the LinkedIn story will come at some time.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - There are certainly some interesting developments here. On the food front, I&#39;m eating probably the largest variety of food I ever have thanks to the company provided lunches. My vegetable consumption is definitely through the roof. I&#39;m staying hydrated with water, green tea, and fruit juices thanks again to the good folks who employ me. The downside is, they also provide unlimited free sugary snacks such as peanut M&amp;Ms and yogurt pretzels. I am weak to these items and have caved on a few occasions. My plan for this going forward is to eat some fruit (also company provided) when I feel the craving for something sweet. At home, the story is a bit different. My kitchen is 100% up to speed, so it&#39;s been a lot of frozen pizzas, peanut butter sammiches, and fried potatoes... also, there&#39;s a Taco Bell three minute&#39;s walking distance from me... and a 7-11 one and half minutes walking distance with many tasty sugary goods. Not eating at these places is going to be an exercise in will power.</p>
<p>Will power is a nice segue into exercise. I made the 1700 mile journey from my home with my bike strapped to the back of my car with the intention of using it as transportation for my daily commute. And I have indeed done that for a select few days. However, I&#39;m finding it harder and harder to motivate myself to exert this much effort early in the morning. Having a bike tire go flat and the bad tire that caused it has not helped. Short story made shorter, I need to stop being lazy.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - This has been ever present on my mind since my last day at Griffin. Moving has been no cheap task and my money reserves have been draining quite quickly. Higher rent, the cost of shipping my stuff out west, and the gas burned to get here are the biggest offenders, but also the lackluster final paycheck threw off the balance. Luckily, my first LI check and relocation money should be arriving soon and I will at least not have to worry about whether all the bills will get paid. If you read the paragraphs above, you know I don&#39;t have any fears about keeping fed. But, when that money does come in, a lot of it will be sunk into furniture-ing up my apartment as most of it was left behind. Also, that trip to Japan is going to be a huge cash suck. I think given a month or two, my financial outlook will be looking much, much better though and I should be able to hit all the goals I set out for in the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - With stability comes free time for me to again pick up the reigns of foreign language study. My intent was to have a better working knowledge for the trip, but that hasn&#39;t panned out due to my own laziness and the craziness of the situation around me. I&#39;m sad to say that my brother, who took his first college course on the subject, is now far more fluent in the language than I. くそ！</p>
<p>So, the reports to come should be interesting as I think my life stage has aligned itself with my intended goals. All I need to do is get my fat, lazy ass in gear and act upon them.</p>

<p>How do you feel?</p>
<p>Unlike Spock in Star Trek IV, I understand the question fine. However, my answer is the same. I don&#39;t really have one.</p>
<p>Moving several states west is, indeed, a very large &quot;life event&quot; and I am fully aware of this. Working for the company running the fourteenth most visited website in the <em>world</em> is no small thing to sneeze at. This is essentially my dream coming true: living in Silicon Valley making a living programming. I&#39;ve only wanted this for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And yet, I don&#39;t have any strong feelings about this. My general response thus far has been &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hit me yet&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m very excited that this opportunity has landed in my lap. As stated, it is my dream come true (at least, one of them). Being able to essentially start my life on a clean slate is certainly appealing and the potential for the future is quite bright.</p>
<p>To that end, I&#39;m also saddened that I have to leave such wonderful people behind. My family and all the friends that I&#39;ve made over the past few years are no longer going to be within quick driving distance. The &quot;clean slate&quot; I mentioned will apply here as well, moving into a state I don&#39;t know, full of people I don&#39;t know, and a culture that is going to baffle the crap out of this Oklahoma native.</p>
<p>But, I don&#39;t feel very strongly any of these emotions. It could very well be that the gravity of the adventure before me <em>hasn&#39;t</em> wormed its way from the conscious part of my brain to the emotion part. But, as I was driving back from my good-bye visit to my family, I had another thought.</p>
<p>I&#39;m ready.</p>
<p>Everything I&#39;ve done up to this point - starting from about the time I started working on YPN in earnest - has been to break into &quot;the industry&quot;. I had my shot back in 2009 when I <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">interviewed at Digg</a>, but looking back, I was nowhere near ready, neither as a developer nor as a person. Since then, I&#39;ve slowly acquired knowledge on both fronts, honing my craft, making friends and learning to better interface with people on a professional and personal level, and just learning how to live in general. It&#39;s been a slow but steady ascent to where I am now and every little experience has prepared me for what I&#39;m about to do.</p>
<p>LinkedIn and California... I&#39;m ready for you.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-internet-and-the-importance-of-being-seen">The Internet and the Importance of Being Seen</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 17, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Many years ago, right before I graduated, some of my fellow graduates and myself were asked to impart any knowledge we&#39;d gleaned from the previous two years upon a class full of freshmen. I said something to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Internet. If you make something, put in on the Internet. I don&#39;t care where, I don&#39;t care how. Get yourself and your work out there. Spam it on Facebook, announce it on twitter. Make as much noise as you can because you never know who might be looking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reasoning for such a bold statement is that twice during my tenure at Full Sail, I had been noticed by entirely random people for various personal projects I had done. One was from the head of the Madden series at EA when he ran across my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows/">Rock Band drums thing</a>, another from a company in Chicago who had run across my deviantArt profile (I actually made money off of that one). The point being, by making public everything I worked on, I was (almost) passively setting up a portfolio of work that could be stumbled across by anybody in the world at any time.</p>
<p>And if you think I stopped after I got my job, then you obviously don&#39;t know me or follow me on any of the various social media avenues. Even if I make something that isn&#39;t necessarily portfolio worthy, if I&#39;ve done something mildly interesting, it finds a home here, on my GitHub profile, or where ever might be a fitting spot. I even dig up and post past projects, because it can give a frame of reference from where I&#39;ve come and how my abilities have evolved.</p>
<p>Of course, just uploading things by itself only gets a person so far. You have to advertise it somewhere. These days, my most vocal platforms are Facebook and reddit, especially reddit, or /r/awwnime in particular. There&#39;s actually a method to that madness beyond making a life of posting cute anime artwork simpler; namely, engaging directly with an audience to gauge need and resolve issues.</p>
<p>My work on awwnime is not the first time I&#39;ve done this. There are quite a few projects of mine that started out as just something to entertain me or make my life simpler in some way, generally pretty niche projects. But, I would then find an audience for these things. A good instance would be <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/how-many-times-can-one-man-code-the-same-thing/">my Tetris Attack game</a> back in 2005. I wanted to ensure that I was being as accurate as I could and also squashing as many bugs as possible. The person writing the code is the worst one to do debugging, generally. So I tossed this out to the guys at the tetrisattack.net forums and got way more response than I could have imagined. This has happened time and again. Animal Crossing Pattern Designer, MP Skin Studio, all the various YPN engine incarnations, all projects that eventually got to the masses and various levels of &quot;acclaim&quot;. Without even really trying, I was building a public history that could prove that I at least know something about my craft while at the same time building my ability to work with people and resolve issues.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present where I&#39;m on the cusp of working for a major player in the Internet sector, and I know that all those years of tossing stupid projects to the masses, spamming the shit out of this blog on twitter and Facebook, keeping all my social profiles up to date, and just engaging with a larger audience be it relevant to anything at all has lead me to where I am today. You never know who is going to be looking at this stuff.</p>
<p>Make it public, make it awesome.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/remuse-the-breakfast-club">Remuse - The Breakfast Club</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 6, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3JSJ2Y9.jpg" alt="" title="The Breakfast Club"></p>
<p>Instead of packing my shit for the move to &quot;Cali&quot;, I&#39;ve been doing not much and also watching TV and movies. I may have stated earlier, but the Breakfast Club is almost wholly responsible for the creation of <a href="http://whatshouldmattwatch.com">whatshouldmattwatch.com</a>, and I finally just bought a copy and watched it. I feel that I will not be able to adequately review this movie because there is simply so much going on. To that point, I don&#39;t think a single watching is sufficient to really pick up on everything this movie has to offer. So, what I will do is offer my brief synopsis (as useful or not as it may be) and then muse about my thoughts on each character (hence the title of this post). Critical review really is not my forte and I don&#39;t want to try and pretend that I can.</p>
<p>Early one Saturday morning, five students find themselves stuck in detention for the remainder of the day. Seemingly, each person is of a different high school character archetype: the athlete, the criminal, the basket case, the brain, and the princess. Throughout the course of the day, each person gives up (willingly or not) details about their lives and all is not necessarily as it seems with the fronts they put up.
