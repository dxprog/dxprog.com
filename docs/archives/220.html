In a nutshell, they lauded the artwork and design (which I thought sucked) and criticised the writing (which I also thought sucked). Here&#39;s the full review: <a href="http://smacktalk.smackjeeves.com/04-digitaldouble">http://smacktalk.smackjeeves.com/04-digitaldouble</a>. Now for my take on things.</p>
<p>One criticism they mention is <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/73400/">A Comic for All Peoples</a> where my counterpart says that the comic is &quot;too deep for a person of average intelligence.&quot; This was actually something devusb mentioned when talking about the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/72976/">2001-WTF?!</a>. Of course, this leads to their other big complaint which is <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/92848/">too</a> many in-jokes. This is one of the reasons I switched formats, the other being I find it easier to write more story-like stuff as opposed to the gag-a-day I had been shooting for. Maybe I should employ the use of a writer.</p>
<p>As said above, I am the first to admit that my writing usually sucks pretty bad. For starters, any comic bearing the name F5 is going to suck. <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54191/">These</a> <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/63958/">comics</a> <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/88991/">suck</a>. Most everything else is pretty &quot;meh&quot; with the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/116184/">exception</a> of a <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/63395/">few</a>.</p>
<p>Their final comment in the cons section about &quot;being doomed to obscurity&quot; I&#39;ve pretty much comed to terms with. There are many people doing this that are a thousand times better at it than I. I&#39;ve just been using it as a creative and emotional outlet and that&#39;s probably all it will continue to be. If fame comes with it, cool, but I&#39;m not getting my hopes up.</p>
