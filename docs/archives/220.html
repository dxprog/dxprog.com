But before I do that I figured I'd post a "before" picture along with an in-depth analysis of what's on/around it. So, here we go:

[url=http://www.dxprog.com/pics/my_desk_dirty.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/thumb.php?file=pics/my_desk_dirty.jpg&size=320" "My Dirty Desk")[/url]

1) My laptop (under a couple of spindles of CDs, goodness knows what's on them)
2) My DS (under a rejection letter from Capital One :-P)
3) Camcorder
4) An empty cup. Probably had ice water in it at one time.
5) A pile of clean jeans under which is a box I still haven't unpacked from the move.
6) Library books (Dave Barry's Money $ecrets and Heir to the Empire to be exact)
7) Trash can (notice how it's empty?)
8) My financial crab
9) My bed
10) My headset (dutifully bringing you l33ts every week)
11) Some cables, a GBASP headset and various other junk
12) Easter candy, a pile of blank DVD-Rs, my CD case (mainly emtpy), a change sorter, my cell phone, both pairs of glasses *deep breath*, a socket set, a phone book, my GameCube memory card, and a lightbulb.
13) This is where my GBA and DS stuff is supposed to go. Mainly it's games and trash now
14) My Mario picture (lovingly hand stitched by grandma)
Pretty sad, eh? Well, this is my pet project for the remainder of the day (which means no work on YAVP for now), however, I will not let that get in the way of dutifully bringing you the next episode of t3h l33ts. Assuming I can get this whole thing clean I'll post the "after" picture tomorrow. Until then....</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/my-life">My Life</a></h1><time class="post__published">April 17, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last blogged mainly because a) I forgot and b) I was in a deep blue funk. But now I&#39;m feeling quite chipper for two reasons: a) I&#39;m going back to cashiering again in May, b) I&#39;ve been selected to join the <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/">ACC</a> Site Improvement Committee. For anybody who&#39;s paid attention, ACPD has been one of my major ongoing projects for the last two years. Now that I am officially connected to the site I&#39;ll be able to push it more and perhaps replace their existing flash editor with <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/acpd/">ACPD Online</a>.</p>
<p>I have yet to call the DMV, however I have been driving again lately and I&#39;m not as rusty as I thought. I WILL CALL TOMORROW!!! Okay, that&#39;s out.</p>
<p>Also, I have YAVP (yet another video project) of which should actually be seeing the light of day. However, I cannot at this time divulge any information aside from that it&#39;s the most expensive project to date. I have spent eighty whole cents on props (my gosh!). I may put the trailer up here soon, but I want to try to get the entire project finished. Also, I&#39;ve been thinking of rewriting Ramboella and filming that now that I&#39;m more buff than I was six months ago. More later...</p>
<p>Finally, before I go, I need to hand out gold stars. One to devusb for properly naming the &quot;Vista blows&quot;, a play off of some lyrics in the Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie song &quot;Every OS Sucks&quot;, and one to linkman2004 for getting the &quot;winds of change quote&quot; of which was uttered by Randall in Monster&#39;s Inc. (and again sarcasticly by Mike). Congratulations and keep your eyes peeled (hint: there&#39;s one in this post). Happy hunting, and happy belated Easter :-).</p>
