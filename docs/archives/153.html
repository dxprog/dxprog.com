My thoughts: This guy is way too nerdy. That doesn&#39;t look too good on his part considering that I am a self-professed geek.

My thoughts: This guy is way too nerdy. That doesn&#39;t look too good on his part considering that I am a self-professed geek. But he didn&#39;t stop there, he also addressed the school board dressed in [Jedi robes)(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJKkjcPLBzE)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJKkjcPLBzE)</a>. But, just because a guy is nerdy doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect upon his ability to perform the duties and obligations that come part and parcel with the position he is trying to fill. Oh, but wait... he&#39;s got a strike against him in that department as well:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m <em>extremely</em> happy with how good I did :-)&quot;</p>
<p>This was posted by Christopher Knight as a postmortem to the embedded video above. Anybody who wants to work in any kind of school environment should at least be able to use proper grammar (for those who didn&#39;t get it that should be &quot;how well [he] did&quot;). And that smiley face just isn&#39;t doing it for me.</p>

Even though I'll only be able to bowl twice I'm still excited. I've been bowling twice in the last couple of weeks and did really well, all games over average and two over two hundred. I could even have some beers if I wanted. T'will be an awesome time to be sure.

Today _also_ marks the two week mark until I leave for Florida. I'm not sure if I've said it before, but I'm currently bored out of my skull. I got most of my packing done _last_ week so that's done. I really don't have much to pack, really. What packing is left to do is of the stuff I use regularly... wait. I _have_ said this before :-/. Granted, I haven't packed the kitchen stuffs yet so there is something left to do. I also need to get my haircut at some point.

That isn't to say I've been completely idle. I did do that little [YPN](http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html) thingy. I've been playing some games that I never finished *ahem* Thousand Year Door *ahem*. I _was_ going to make another short movie, but lack of wardrobe kind of puts a damper on that. You'd think it'd be a simple matter finding a white wig, but no. Not in Bartlesville.

Whilst I was out on one of these wig finding missions I ran across something at a local craft store. It was a cheap glue gun (packaged and distributed in my good state of Oklahoma). It looks fairly standard to the casual observer but reading the fine print reveals, well see for yourself:

Needless to say I'm sending it in to Jay and hopefully it'll make headlines some night. If it does I'll be sure to have a YouTube clip up here the next day.
