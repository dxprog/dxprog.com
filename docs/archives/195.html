<p>As the title suggest, however, I have made another video. It&#39;s mainly just a fancy edit job of an otherwise fairly boring, yet monumental, event. Enjoy!</p>

Okay, so I cheated a little on this one. However, in my defense, I'm winding up a 6 day run at work with no break in between so what free time I have had I've spent doing other stuff. I promise that Friday's will be a good one (it's the one with the "complex" artwork I mentioned earlier).</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/digital-double-the-plagiarist-survivor-the-lost-edition">Digital Double - &quot;The Plagiarist - Survivor: The &quot;Lost&quot; Edition</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 13, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54195/">Comic</a></p>

Of course, since it isn't really optional anymore my camera has a phone on it. That said I've been having a little bit of fun with the thing and posting them to my flickr account. I'm sure you don't want to have to go to another site to see more of my crap so I made it easy and put a little flickr thingy on the right side below the archives. Enjoy :-)</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/digital-double-the-plagiarist-peanuts">Digital Double - &quot;The Plagiarist - Peanuts&quot;</a></h1><time class="post__published">August 11, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content">[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54194/)

I am actually a fairly large fan of Peanuts (at least, pre-80s Peanuts). However, one thing that drove me insane was that Charlie Brown never stood up for himself. He allowed his life to be a constant joke to everybody and everything around him. He should've taken Plankton's advice and asserted himself as he does here.

Interesting side note, there's currently a manager at Wal-Mart whose name is Charlie Brown (seriously, what were those parents thinking :-P).</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/196.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/194.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
