A handful of subjects and some words on how I failed to meet them. Works well today when I&#39;m buzzing a bit and just need to get a post out.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I actually did very well last week, biking to work four out of five days and keeping away from the sweets. I stumbled a bit on Friday where I had a heart stopping burger and didn&#39;t bike, but it could have been worse. The weekend was fairly low key calorie wise as well. Compare that to today where I had four beers while conversing with a certain USB input virtual accessor and killing digital robots and then following it up with Taco Bell. Not great to be sure. Also, it&#39;s been rainy, so I haven&#39;t biked. Tomorrow I plan on changing that.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I&#39;m still running through the list of stuff I need to get for living in my new quarters. This weekend, I acquired myself a new bed, one of much higher quality than I&#39;m used to having; certainly one that cost more money than I would&#39;ve otherwise been comfortable in parting with. Additionally, a small trip to Japantown drained a few dollars, but not too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Ain&#39;t done squat, and this is unacceptable. Though, I do often listen to some of the audio lessons when they pop up on random during bike rides... this isn&#39;t actually helping me, though. It does sometimes re-enforce the little Japanese I do know, I guess.</p>

Instead, I&#39;ll give you some pictures of in progress comics... that have been that way for probably a year now. A couple of these I&#39;ll probably finish eventually, and one I don&#39;t even remember the premise for, so it&#39;ll forever remain a mystery.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/i-intend-to-live-forever">I Intend to Live Forever</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 22, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I missed a day of blogging (again), so sue me. But, allow me to get philosophical for just a moment.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of interesting notions in quantum physics, most interesting of which (and relevant to my muse) are that of quantum suicide and the multiverse theory. Quantum suicide is a thought experiment wherein a person is placed in a room with a death machine that has a 50/50 chance of killing the person every ten seconds. Tack on the multiverse theory, and both outcomes happen, birthing a new universe with each outcome. In the end, the person both dies lots of times and also never dies. Obviously, to the subject, they always experience the outcome where they live because death isn&#39;t something you can really experience.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s assume all of the above is true. That means only one thing.</p>
<p>Each and every one of us would be immortal... to our own point of view.</p>
<p>From an observation stand point, the mortality rate of the human race is 100%. The odds of living after a certain age become enormously small, but perhaps never actually zero. As long as there were even the most tiny chance that a person&#39;s heart would continue beating another second, they would continue down the string of universes in which they can continue to observe. In a way, their universe really does revolve around them.</p>
<p>Now, why haven&#39;t we seen a person 5000 years old? Because to the rest of us watching, the odds generally win. Every once and again a person will continue chugging long after the average age and push in into their &quot;later&quot; hundreds, but the odds that they&#39;ll die &quot;any day now&quot; keep going up until the rest of us observe them dying.</p>
<p>Is this something I believe? No, not really. But it&#39;s kind of fun to think about. Only time will tell if it&#39;s correct.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ll be the only one that will know the answer in my observable universe.</p>

<p>Alright, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUMSzogqM_Y">General Specific</a>. The words uttered through your clenched teeth have moved me to pursue a career in art. I&#39;ll call that number.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNET MAGIC!</strong></p>
<p>Oh, shit! It came! Draw only <strong>one</strong> of the subjects, huh... guess I&#39;ll draw the pirate...</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sE8J0Ydh.jpg" alt="" title="Fucking, arg matey"></p>
<p>Hmmm... seems a little bland. I have drawn only one of their subjects, but I need to fill in this white space...</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nwtNjdih.jpg" alt="" title="Of course I would draw Squid Girl. Also, fuck hands!"></p>
<p>Sweet! Now to fill out the bottom section...</p>

<p>Now just to send it using the prepaid envelope. I hope these guys respond and give me some free blog fodder!</p>
