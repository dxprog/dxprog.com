The first phase of the brackets always sucks because it means a lot of tedious labor for me.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consists of people nominating the characters they&#39;d like to see make it to the actual voting. This year, I put a lot of additional rules in place, limiting the time span from which somebody could enter a character. This was done to give new characters a fighting change, keep things fresh, and also (hopefully) shrink the pool.</p>
<p>Well, that didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>As of me writing this, three days into the seven day long nomination period, there have been over 1500 nominations. I have had to go through each and every one of those and, for the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-girls-bracket/characters/">830 nominees that were eligible and not duplicates</a>, clean up the name and create a thumbnails. A few things have made this slightly easier this year than last.</p>
<ul>
<li>Better admin tools</li>
<li>A requirement that the user provide an image of the character so I don&#39;t have to go hunting for one</li>
<li>A type-ahead field that pulls data from <a href="http://myanimelist.com">MyAnimeList</a> that will prefill character name, media source, and image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MAL images always come in a 225x350 size, so I&#39;ve gotten the cropping down to muscle memory; I can complete an entrants record in under 10 seconds. Which is good, because even at ten seconds per, that&#39;s over two hours of solid work. But, the average is much higher because I still sometimes need to find a better picture, figure out if the character is eligible if I&#39;m not familiar with the source, etc and so forth. I&#39;ve probably put five to six hours into just cropping those fucking pictures.</p>
<p>But, still, I&#39;m happy with the turn out. To give you a bit of comparison, last year when there were no restricting rules, there were a total of 797 nominations of which 473 made it into the elimination rounds. I suspect part of that is due to the fact that this bracket is starting out with the traction we had at the end of the last one. But also, a lot of people are just nominating every female character from their favorite shows, regardless of how much actual screen time they may have had. I personally think this is a silly approach because only 256 characters will make it to the actual bracket and those will all be the heavy hitter characters. I mean, who seriously thinks that <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/z4.jpg">this</a> will win against <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/ln.jpg">this</a> on a battle based upon cuteness?</p>
<p>Not me, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

It&#39;s become a bad habit for sure.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ovHy1omh.jpg" alt="" title="Staxxx of anime"></p>
<p>On the left is the pile of shows I&#39;ve seen, but not from the versions I&#39;ve purchased. To be fair, the Lucky Star and Haruhi boxes were double dips; I already owned the complete series sets, but Amazon was selling the big ones for $3 (thanks for going out of business, Bandai). On the right are the shows I&#39;ve seen only partially or not at all. A bunch of it I got during RightStuf&#39;s Christmas sale last year (I&#39;m a sucker for deals).</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mje5.jpg" alt="" title="Don&#39;t play games with my heart"></p>
<p>Moving on to games, there are far less than the above movies/anime. Granted, this doesn&#39;t take into account my Steam collection. Still, a few items here fall into &quot;haven&#39;t completed on this particular media&quot; category, namely the Famicom games. Lego Indiana Jones I only purchased to hack my Wii U, so I doubt I&#39;ll ever play that at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8PTyXBgh.jpg" alt="" title="Books, check &#39;em out!"></p>
<p>You may recall some of these from my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/unjacking-from-the-matrix-an-experiment/">no internet experiment</a> last year. Well, many have gone unread and more have been added since. The Haganai book I only got a couple days ago, so perhaps that one counts less. Making matters worse, however, is the enormous stack of Japanese literature I&#39;ve acquired for that magical day when I can comprehend the language. I can <em>read</em> most of these (when there are furigana for the kanji), but I can&#39;t understand 99.97% of them. I have leafed through them all a fair amount, though, and a couple are really only art books.</p>
<p>So, it appears I have a problem pouring money into my hobbies and then not actually following up on them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this should be my new years challenge... to have done <em>before</em> 2014...</p>

<p>Obviously there have been some feature adds, but I was a bit shocked to see that I was essentially pixel perfect in coding this (something I rarely bother with in personal projects). I did have to go in and add the <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/css/mastering-css-reflections-in-webkit/">album reflection</a>, but it was fifteen minutes well spent. I looks fuckin&#39; DOPE!</p>

<p>Now, I just need to get the app looking as cool...</p>
