I&#39;m sure I say it every time I do this, but this iteration is by far the most advanced version of the site to date. I can pretty much wrap up all the updates in a nutshell by saying I&#39;ve had a lot of fun throwing in all sorts of jQuery and Ajaxy stuff, but I&#39;ll itemize.</p>
<p>The front page, for starters, shows the latest and greatest projects and blog posts on the site in the featured pane. The gallery has undergone a huge overhaul and is much more intuitive than it was before. I&#39;ve also uploaded quite a lot of new content to the gallery page, so go take a gander at that to see what awesome stuff I&#39;ve been up to. And finally, even the contact is looking spiffier with a picture of yours truly and a link to all the social media outlets I&#39;m currently signed up for.</p>
<p>With the new design out of the way, I&#39;ll shift focus to the new {mh}labs; section of the website, where you&#39;ll be able to find all sorts of little pojects that have never been released to the general public (and some that have).</p>
<p>The future is bright at dxprog.com, so be sure to bookmark us and return often for all sorts of goody goodness.</p>

So, after some digging through Twitter APIs and some refreshers on HTTP Authentication, I wrote this tiny, beautiful little script.

```php

// Return values
define ("TWITTER_OK", true);
define ("TWITTER_UNAUTHORIZED", -1);
define ("TWITTER_TOO_LONG", -2);
define ("TWITTER_COULD_NOT_CONNECT", -3);

function sendTweet ($status, $userName, $userPass)
{

	// Open a socket to Twitter
	if (!($socket = fsockopen ("twitter.com", 80)))
		return TWITTER_COULD_NOT_CONNECT;
	
	// Create the headers
	$headers = "POST /statuses/update.xml HTTP/1.1\r\n";
	$headers .= "Host: twitter.com\r\n";
	$headers .= "Authorization: Basic ".base64_encode ($userName.":".$userPass)."\r\n";
	$headers .= "Content-length: ".strlen ("status=$status")."\r\n\r\n";
	$headers .= "status=$status\r\n";
	
	// Send the headers
	fwrite ($socket, $headers);
	
	// Get the response
	$response = "";
	while (!feof ($socket))
		$response .= fgets ($socket, 1024);
	
	// Check for HTTP status OK (200)
	if (!strpos ($response, "200"))
		return TWITTER_UNAUTHORIZED;

	return TWITTER_OK;
		
}

```

It is as simple as it looks. Enjoy!</div></article><div class="paging"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/133.html" class="paging__link paging__link--next">Earlier Posts</a><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/archives/131.html" class="paging__link paging__link--previous">Later Posts</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2018 Matt Hackmann</p></footer></section></body></html>
