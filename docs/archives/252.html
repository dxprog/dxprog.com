<p>It&#39;s been over three weeks since I&#39;ve posted a comic so I decided to drag the wacom downstairs and make it on the parents&#39; computer. Speaking of which, there was no pencil work for this one. It was all sketched out digtally. That tablet rocks!</p>

Comment posting still doesn&#39;t work and the &quot;My Digg&quot; bar is broken, but I think this is probably one of the best designs I&#39;ve had in a while. But don&#39;t take my word for it, <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/new_design.png">see for yourselves.</a> The comic page is also done in this style, though it&#39;s not quite working yet.</p>
