<p>Some months ago, I was trying to beef up the user feedback that <a href="http://awwnime.redditbooru.com/">redditbooru</a> would give when making requests to the server. One thing I wanted to do was, during a reverse image lookup, have a continually updating status to the user. &quot;Retrieving image&quot;, &quot;Searching database&quot;, and then the final data. This required a couple of interesting things: implementing an event model in PHP, and the not-so-talked-about third readyState value in the XMLHttpRequest response: 3, or &quot;processing request&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="php-eventing">PHP Eventing</h2>
<p>Anybody who has coded JavaScript for more than thirty minutes will understand that it runs on a highly evented model. You attach a listener to an object with a function callback, the object fires and event, and the callback is called with data provided pertaining to the event in question. PHP, being a highly linear programming language, doesn&#39;t really have such a concept baked in. Being that I wanted something that could be easily reused through out an entire project, I came up with a stupid simple <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/lib/events.php">events library</a>. Pertaining to the internal event modelling, it exposes the following two methods:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">public static function addEventListener($eventType, $callback);
public static function fire($eventType, $data = null);
</code></pre>
<p>These work essentially as they do in JavaScript: subscribe to an event with addEventListener and provide a callback. Fire an event with fire of that event type with whatever relevant information that goes with. addEventListener is constructed such that you can add multiple callbacks for a single event, much like the sugary goodness that jQuery provides to the DOM. One possible drawback of my implementation is that the event bus is essentially global, being that all the methods are static. This means you could have naming collisions on event types. Granted, this could easily be converted into an abstract class that any class could later inherit, providing this functionality.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of quick production examples of <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/api/image.php#L215">event firing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/controller/images.php#L199">event subscribing</a>. One half of the puzzle solved.</p>
<h2 id="sending-and-parsing-evented-json">Sending and Parsing Evented JSON</h2>
<p>As stated previously, on modern browsers, the XMLHttpRequest response has a third ready state of &quot;processing request&quot;. Essentially, this fires at certain points as the request is receiving data. We can use this to our advantage to send small status updates to the user as the backend performs numerous/long running tasks. Part of the events library are some calls to handle what I refer to as &quot;evented Ajax&quot;, though I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a real term for it. It has the following methods:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">public static function beginAjaxEvent();
public static function endAjaxEvent();
public static function sendAjaxEvent($eventType, $data);
</code></pre>
<p>beginAjaxEvent and endAjaxEvent do essentially what you would expect: they prime the system for sending data out in this fashion and tidy everything up necessarily. sendAjaxEvent is where all the fun happens. I&#39;m going to go through this guy line by line.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">public static function sendAjaxEvent($eventType, $data) {
$out = new stdClass;
$out-&gt;eventType = $eventType;
$out-&gt;data = $data;
$out = json_encode($out);

// Pad out the request to a minimum of 4K for Chrome
if (strlen($out) &lt; 4096) {
$out = str_pad($out, 4096, &#39; &#39;);
}
echo $out;
flush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Line 3-7</strong> - pretty simple, preparing the data that will actually be sent to the browser as a JSON response.
<strong>Line 8-11</strong> - An oddity I ran into with Chrome while developing this. Apparently, it will only fire a processing event if the data received is 4K or greater. So, to ensure that the event is fired, we pad the response out to 4K at minimum.
<strong>Line 12-13</strong> - spit out the data and flush the buffer to the browser.</p>
<p>For the power this can wield, it&#39;s pretty simple stuff. Of course, you need to be properly set up to receive this type of response on the client end. Being as I&#39;m focusing on the PHP side here, I won&#39;t go into details, but <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/view/js/scripts.js#L78">you can check out my implementation</a>. The implementation is fairly tightly coupled with how it&#39;s piped out of PHP, particularly expecting the last and largest data coming down the pipe to be an event named &quot;data&quot;. But, I have yet to receive any user complaints that this doesn&#39;t work, so that&#39;s the important part.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is nice and all, but this particular intrigue of onreadtstatechange isn&#39;t compatible on some browsers (cough, IE, cough). For that, there are fallbacks in place to use a standard Ajax request a la jQuery. By setting &quot;evented&quot; parameter on the URL to the request, the event model can be effectively turned on or off. The internal events are ignored, and what would be sent in the data event becomes the response. It&#39;s a gracefully degrading solution to the issue. Granted, that query string parameter could go away entirely if one was to do user agent sniffing on the backend.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s my little write-up on what was probably an afternoon of coding. I haven&#39;t yet implemented this anywhere else, but I think that at least the events model could have some (or a lot of uses) in many day to day cases, especially if you were to start messing around with multi-threading in PHP.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s a post for another day.</p>

I couldn&#39;t just take that sitting down, so here I am in a [mother disapproved word removed]-wagging contest, a contest which really doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>I love to talk about how lazy I am. For instance, sometimes when I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;ll just continue being hungry because I don&#39;t want to stare into the cupboards and figure out what to make, or I just don&#39;t want to clean all the required hardware. Or perhaps there&#39;s just no food to be had. Either way, this is a thing that happens and it certainly has all the hallmarks of laziness.</p>
<p>But to say I&#39;m lazy overall isn&#39;t really true. I am selectively lazy. When it comes to programming tasks (or anything computer related, really) I&#39;m always up to something. At the moment, I&#39;m up to a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Work</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on and off all weekend trying to pump out a gratuitous amount of code in a stack that I have no business touching. During one of our team meetings, I set a bar for myself by telling everybody that I would take on a beefy amount of engineering work because I feel I have to prove myself (through many discussions with the people I work with, this is apparently incorrect thinking). That&#39;s actually only part of it; it seemed like a fun challenge. And this has shown to be more or less correct, as I&#39;ve lost some hours just pounding away at the keyboard. The long compile times aren&#39;t fun, but I&#39;ve learned a fuckton of stuff, both about how your <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/conanobrien">LinkedIn profile page</a> is pulled together, but also a bit about Java and a bit more about OOP. Besides, those compile times are easily whiled away by playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_25th_Anniversary_(NES_video_game">Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</a>) game for NES.</p>
<p>On top of that, there&#39;s a presentation I need to write pretty damn soon. I have been chosen to pitch web development at LinkedIn to a throng of up and comings at my alma mater next month. I haven&#39;t even started on that...</p>
<p><strong>Awwnime Bracket</strong></p>
<p>Last year&#39;s awwnime bracket only got a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/weekend-of-productivity/">couple</a> of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">nods</a> in the blog despite eating up nearly two solid months of my life. This year it&#39;s coming back, but we&#39;re also running an additional bracket for male characters (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1n5q2t/2013_boys_bracket_round_1_group_a/">which came with it&#39;s own set of problems</a>). In an attempt to make things actually manageable, I spent some time into moving all my one off shell scripts into the code base proper and writing an administrative interface around that. Additionally, I moved away from the money sucking <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me.s3.amazonaws.com/bracket/bracket_round1_groupB.jpg?v7">giant images</a> and switch to something <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-boys-bracket/view/">rendered in browser</a>. It&#39;s also much friendlier to interactiveness that way.</p>
<p><strong>Freelance</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that I keep promising myself I&#39;ll never freelance again, the sweet allure of &quot;free money&quot; is too much. Now, the upside is I haven&#39;t had to bust my ass on any of the one (possible two) projects in the pipeline at this point, but still, they hang over me ling a large, swinging axe.</p>
<p><strong>Other things in the wings</strong></p>
<p>On top of all that, there are still items in the backburner. Fixes/updates to redditbooru, especially the backend service. I majiggered the main part off of a cron job and into a node run task (initially to curb an issue I experienced after upgrading to php 5.5), but now that the code is there, I can multithread that bitch. On top of that, there are changes I&#39;d love to make to the music page, the music page physical controller I&#39;ve been tinkering with, and the iPhone app that I&#39;ve begun writing for it.</p>
<p>My plate is full of computery things for sure, despite what I say about laziness. I&#39;m probably heading straight for a burnout, but these things ebb and flow, and right now they&#39;re just flowing.</p>
<p>I guess you could say I&#39;m on my development period...</p>
