<p>Entry 1 - June 8, 2002</p>
<p>Well today was my birthday. Sixteen at last. While today was great, it was kind of odd too. It started off with me getting up at three AM. I checked my mail and watched cartoons. Jeff joined about four-thirty. While he was watching cartoons, I worked on my new VB site, Visual Basic Gaming Universe. My intent is to join the VB gaming webring, and maybe win an award. I fell asleep on the couch and didn&#39;t wake up until about ten or so. After I got dressed and ate, I started on my cake. Unfortunatly, I messed that one up. So mom rushed out and got a couple more boxes of mix and that one went okay. While that was baking, we had lunch. Then mom went out to take some newspapers to ARC, while Jeff, Chris and I picked up. When mom got back, she and I rushed right back out to get a camera. When we got back, I frosted my cake and Grandma came a few minutes after that. We had the normal ritual of opening presents. No duh! :) From Mom, Dad, and the rest I got a really cool pocket knife, Dr. Mario, this journal, and the Ep II soundtrack, and from Grandma I got thirty bucks. After Grandma left, Mom let me work on VBGU some more. Then she and Dad did shopping. When they got back I played some Dr. Mario. Joey jumped on me and I hurt him so I got in trouble. After that I went to our room and was sleeping until about now. So it was a pretty good day overall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much to say here, though my acceptance of commas in the year between journal entries is certainly welcomed. I still seem unable to write a non-disjointed narrative, though. It&#39;s disconcerting to say the least.</p>
<p>Also, webrings...</p>

<p>May 9, 2001 - Eleventh Entry</p>
<p>Hi! Lot of stuff goiong on. First of all I was actually succesful in making a game in vb. It is a game Jeff requested. You fly around in a spaceship and shoot down aliens. Also Im going to build a computer from stuff off of eBay. I have the process which is an Amd 486 Dx4 100mhz. I am currently watching a compatible motherboard. [various statement redacted] Oh well. I&#39;m on the St. Jhon&#39;s ball team this year, and I am not as pathetic as I thought. In fact i&#39;m pretty good. Maggie is crawling now. She is also pulling up on the couch. Well my hand is getting tired so it&#39;s time to wrap it up. Bye.</p>

<p>I recall quite well my time on my church&#39;s softball team. And, no, I was not good. Also, I was in early pubescence and emotional as shit. There is one particular instance of tear filled rage that I remember more clearly than I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>We&#39;d just lost game one of a double header and I was playing catcher (as I was wont to d0). Every time I failed to get the softball back to our pitcher, he&#39;d give me &quot;you-fucking-idiot&quot; look (which only exacerbated the issue); there was play at the plate where I fumbled the ball and, as I dejectedly moped after it thinking that this bout of activity was done, the jackass on third stole home. This only made my mood worse and by the end of the game I was a shaking, tear filled mess (needless to say we lost). I stormed off the field and, between sobs, angrily told my dad that I wanted to quit the team. I don&#39;t know really remember much after that, but I calmed down enough to play game two (which went better) and finished out the season. The team dissolved after that (perhaps I was to blame) and my softball career was cut short. I went on to join the bowling league the next year with much better results.</p>
<p>To this day, I still don&#39;t have a very high opinion of the guy who pitched that game. Ironically, he lives not far from my parents&#39; current residence, though I was lucky enough to never run into him. If I had, I probably would&#39;ve chucked a softball into his shins which would&#39;ve exploded from the sheer awesomeness of my pitch.</p>
<p>Because when I throw a ball now, it goes exactly where the fuck I want it to.</p>

<p>Tenth Entry - February 18, 2001</p>
<p>Hi! Now I have to catch up on the last 1/2 year of stuff. Maggie was born on october 2. Now she is almost five months old. This week she (and Joe and Steve) have been sick. And me... I&#39;M IMMUNE. My programming has progressed a ways. I&#39;ve mastered HTML and I&#39;m going on VBScript. I have been looking at versions of VBasic on eBay. Most of VB6 go for $70 or higher. So I&#39;m thinking of making my own computer from stuff on eBay. If you are wondering how I&#39;m going to get the dough, aside from my B-Day money, I got a, get some iron straps and brace yourself, $10.60 from sales at Biblio. Also, grandma has hired me to mow her lawn this summer. But now I&#39;m getting off the subject. I have learned some DirectX for VB. My webpage is pretty snazzy. I am now doing Algebra I for school. Two or three weeks ago I made a real bow. And it actually works. Well, that&#39;s all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I recall, this is the year that I managed to skip getting sick with the rest of the family (hence the &quot;I&#39;m immune&quot; comment). Sickness in the Hackmann residence is, on the whole, a very clock-work process: twice a year, generally in early fall and late winter, the entire family gets the basic cold. Sore throat, achey body, and what I affectionately refer to as the &quot;sickness delerium&quot;. I&#39;ve skipped a sickness cycle this year as well, of which I&#39;m mildly nervous about...</p>
<p>Moving on, the money of which I spoke was from taking some books into a local home school book consignment store (Biblio). That I would make any money off that at all blew my tiny, fragile little mind and I obviously extrapolated the potential to a ridiculous degree. Though, if my fourteen year old self were to know about the ~8 cheap, thrift store computers that are sitting in my closet, he&#39;d probably shit a brick. I plan to do something grande with those computers one of these days, but today is not that day.</p>
<p>Nor is tomorrow...</p>

<p>Spawned from yet another conversation with a certain Mr. Helton.</p>
<p>There is partial truth to this comic; the extra two grand that went into my eye surgery over standard LASIK involved additional scans to increase the accuracy of my prescription. Also, it was bladeless, which was a far easier idea to stomach.</p>
<p>Also, journal entries shall show up at some point. I lost the journal I was on somewhere while cleaning up after the move. The irony is, I had set it aside after unpacking it from its box...</p>

<p>Let us all celebrate the glorious return of my most shitty comic, Digital Double. My split personality counterparts will once again grace the interwebs, much to the ill of the general populace. I am most sincerely sorry!</p>
<p>In more seriousness, it felt good to make a comic again.</p>
<p>Also, naps are destroying my life.</p>
