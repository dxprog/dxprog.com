So, I&#39;m going to jump to the most important entry in there; the entry that, looking back on it, in many ways kick started my life on the path that has led me here. Without further ado:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today was the oddest/horrible days of my life. It started off fairly normal. We got ready for Mass and headed off as usual. We drove towards Tulsa in conditioned comfort. We were nearly in town when the van started acting up. Mom ordered everyone out of the van. It wasn&#39;t until I got out until I noticed the smoke billowing off the hood. As we backed away from the van we noticed flames under it. A couple of people from the parish stopped. Some other guy stopped and poked around in the van. Mom and Mary Cook were screaming at him to beat it. By the time the fire truck was passing on the other side the van was engulfed in flames. They did get it out and there stood the blackened courpse of what used to be our mode of transportation. So Jeff, Steve, Maggie and I hitched a ride to the curch with the Howzers. When the others got there, Mr. Howzer drove us home. Next to that nothing else has really happened. Okay, I scraped my knee. But it&#39;s late (and raining) and I&#39;m off to bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Name spelling errata aside, the van burning up was actually a fairly large turning point in family history. I don&#39;t think any one thing that followed is necessarily directly attributable, but it was the &quot;big event&quot; upon which other smaller, but more important events happened very close to.</p>
<p>Shortly after the car barbecue, we got the enormous, <a href="http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/express-1500/2001/">15 passenger van</a> that is now the Hackmobile and also the vehicle with which I learned to drive. With that in our possession, it seemed like we began to do more things within the parish, such as my creating and running of their website (my first real experience doing web work outside of for my own fancy or the YPN) in addition to myself and the two younger brothers behind me becoming <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/attention-span-0/">altar boys</a>.</p>
<p>In all this, I began to get my programming skills known and also begin the long process of shedding my introversion and bringing a level of normality to my social skills (a thing that is still ongoing, it seems). Again, I don&#39;t know if the event of the Crispy Van (as it was later called) is directly involved in any of this, but it was certainly something memorable. But, the fire was not without casualties.</p>
<p>My brother&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/KB-Gear-JamP3-Digital-Player/dp/B000050AVW">JamP3</a> didn&#39;t survive.</p>

<p>Surely this needs <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-year-of-music-now-with-interactive-graphs/">no introduction</a> at this point.</p>
<p>My brother Chris and I are heavy users of my music page to the point that we have &quot;fight&quot; over what songs show up in the trending list. Now, this is a bit difficult because our listening habits are quite different and we have a lot of overlap in music tastes.</p>
<p>Now, if you clicked that link up there (or recall from when that post when up), I log each and every song that is played. This is a never ending source of fun for me as I constantly find new ways of interpreting the data, the <a href="http://music.dxprog.com/dt10.php?year=2012">Dx Top 10</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>That said, it has been some time since I&#39;ve crunched these numbers into some nice graphs, so I thought it would be fun to display our battle for dominance as such. The following data was culled from February to April of this year (where I began accurately tracking who played what). For additional details, hover over a row.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Entry 2 - June 9, 2002</p>
<p>Well I have now been sixteen for twenty-four hours. Nothing special. We went to Mass as usual. Afterward we went to Gardener&#39;s and looked around a while. I found an HTML book for Chris. Mom found an old Catholic text book for a buck. We came home to some stew Dad cooked up. It was really good. After that I played some Dr. Mario. Then I worked up an ASP program to hold my financial stuff. Then we went to bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, there is something to be mentioned here. Gardners, erroneously spelled above, is a local used bookstore. Back in my youth, it was a great place to ogle over almost irrelevant programming books (most of which are actually still at the store today). Nowadays, I ignore the computer section entirely and mostly peruse the manga section ($5 tankoban is a pretty good deal).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 3 - June 10, 2002</p>
<p>An amazing this happened today. I completed every subject in school! I also finished my Mockingbird synopsis. Amazery! And on top of all that, I made it through level twenty of Dr. Mario. I also chatted with &quot;kpyro&quot; on AOL. So over today  was really good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>kypyro was one of the first and only people I ever talked with off the YPN boards and at that it was very brief. I don&#39;t recall why, but I came to distrust him at one point. The only actual person I chat with from those days anymore hadn&#39;t even joined YPN at that point.</p>

I reach the end, there are a few blank pages, and then I see this:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/journal_steve.jpg" alt="" title="The doorway into another realm"></p>
<p>It would seem that while I was away at college, my brother Steve saw fit to claim my property as his own and pour his own thoughts on paper. As payback for soiling my stuff, I will dump the best entries here. HAHA!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 3: 12-3-07</p>
<p>Today was  a regular day.Today on the advent calendar we saw a blind man. Thats it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 5: 12-12-07</p>
<p>Today was hectic. I woke up about 11:00 o clock. We had lunch. Then Mom and me went to pick up Verna. I had to go because Mom wanted to get me some new mass shoes because I had to serve tonight.  Mom bought a 60 pair of shoes. So we went to Wal Mart just in case we could find anything cheaper (and better). We found a pair but we didn&#39;t get them. Then we got me a mass shirt. Then we went. When it was time to go I put on all me new stuff. We got me socks to. Then we went. When we got outside I said shotgun first but didn&#39;t get to sit up front!! &gt;:( !!! When we got to church Mom escorted me to the sacristy. There I put on a cassick, surplice, and a cape. Father Festas was ate so immediately after he got dressed mass started. As we were walking down the aidle deacon Joe noticed that my cape was inside out. Well that really stank. After mass I put out the candles but I didn&#39;t put out the advent wreath candles because I didn&#39;t think I was supposed to. Then we went home. Dad got Taco Bell for supper because we hadn&#39;t had any supper because mass was at 5:15. Then we watched the Santa Claus. While mom and I were shopping everyone made peppermint bark. Well my hand is killing me now so I&#39;ll quit.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, out of the sixteen entries he wrote, this is the only one that doesn&#39;t end in the phrase &quot;Well, that&#39;s it&quot;.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting (or perhaps disconcerting) is the fact that his prose is nigh identical to my own in my first few entries. Those three word sentences are poetic beauty. Granted, he was only eleven at the time of these writings whereas I was thirteen. Perhaps I was a little behind the curve...</p>
<p>He&#39;s made up for it in the five years since, though. He recently entered a <a href="http://balmoraman.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4thww5">piece</a> into a writing contest held by the local library and took away <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2012/04/friday-at-last/">second place</a> (netting him a not too shabby $50 prize). More than I can say for myself at that age.</p>
<p>At sixteen I was busy destroying the YPN...</p>

This one seems to all be written in cursive (much to my dismay). But, we shall begin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entry 1 - June 8, 2002</p>
<p>Well today was my birthday. Sixteen at last. While today was great, it was kind of odd too. It started off with me getting up at three AM. I checked my mail and watched cartoons. Jeff joined about four-thirty. While he was watching cartoons, I worked on my new VB site, Visual Basic Gaming Universe. My intent is to join the VB gaming webring, and maybe win an award. I fell asleep on the couch and didn&#39;t wake up until about ten or so. After I got dressed and ate, I started on my cake. Unfortunatly, I messed that one up. So mom rushed out and got a couple more boxes of mix and that one went okay. While that was baking, we had lunch. Then mom went out to take some newspapers to ARC, while Jeff, Chris and I picked up. When mom got back, she and I rushed right back out to get a camera. When we got back, I frosted my cake and Grandma came a few minutes after that. We had the normal ritual of opening presents. No duh! :) From Mom, Dad, and the rest I got a really cool pocket knife, Dr. Mario, this journal, and the Ep II soundtrack, and from Grandma I got thirty bucks. After Grandma left, Mom let me work on VBGU some more. Then she and Dad did shopping. When they got back I played some Dr. Mario. Joey jumped on me and I hurt him so I got in trouble. After that I went to our room and was sleeping until about now. So it was a pretty good day overall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much to say here, though my acceptance of commas in the year between journal entries is certainly welcomed. I still seem unable to write a non-disjointed narrative, though. It&#39;s disconcerting to say the least.</p>
<p>Also, webrings...</p>
