<p>Alright, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUMSzogqM_Y">General Specific</a>. The words uttered through your clenched teeth have moved me to pursue a career in art. I&#39;ll call that number.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNET MAGIC!</strong></p>
<p>Oh, shit! It came! Draw only <strong>one</strong> of the subjects, huh... guess I&#39;ll draw the pirate...</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sE8J0Ydh.jpg" alt="" title="Fucking, arg matey"></p>
<p>Hmmm... seems a little bland. I have drawn only one of their subjects, but I need to fill in this white space...</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nwtNjdih.jpg" alt="" title="Of course I would draw Squid Girl. Also, fuck hands!"></p>
<p>Sweet! Now to fill out the bottom section...</p>

<p>Now just to send it using the prepaid envelope. I hope these guys respond and give me some free blog fodder!</p>

Seriously, you are all queer folk (yes, you pervert, <em>that</em> kind of queer).</p>
<p>So, you read and/or saw about the trip to Odaiba and the enormous Gundam statue. Well, the part that I mentioned but didn&#39;t detail was the walk across the Rainbow Bridge, a suspension bridge that runs across some water and into Odaiba. We walked that bitch, all 0.5 miles of it, not including the walk to from the station nor the walk into Odaiba. I put in nearly 30000 steps that day, or somewhere on the order of 10 miles of walking. Granted, some of that was from the Imperial Palace earlier in the day (we&#39;re traveling back in time on these posts, I guess).</p>
<p>But, enough of the chit chat, here be pictures.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-weekly-accountability-report-back-to-the-grind">The Weekly Accountability Report - Back to the Grind</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 17, 2013</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It&#39;s been a little while since I last did this, but since life is only going to even out from here, it&#39;s time to return to the Goals of the Year(R).</p>
<p><strong>Helth</strong> - Haven&#39;t been doing super awesome here. The allure of free M&amp;Ms is great indeed, and I&#39;ve now discovered the stash of breakfast burritos that work has in their infinite refrigerators. On top of that, laziness has lead to walks to Taco Bell and 7-Eleven (which doesn&#39;t make much sense). But, the &quot;no sugar, fruit&quot; rule is now enacted and a ban on fast food as well. Exercise wise, I&#39;ve just purchased myself a new and awesome bike that doesn&#39;t destroy my body as I try to ride, so there will be no more driving to work (weather permitting). These are now the two major areas of concern.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I&#39;m still in a pattern of getting things that I need to fill out my apartment, though the major purchases are tapering off (my big ass trip to Japan notwithstanding). Currently, the only items remaining on the list are new shoes (mine are quite literally falling apart), a table, and a bed. The bed will probably happen first as the couch is getting less and less comfortable by the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - If the Japan trip told me anything, it&#39;s that my skills in the language are nowhere near enough to actually get by day-to-day. I need to get back on this pronto. Perhaps not this year, but taking the ACT and enrolling for actual classes would probably be wise.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - FUCKIN&#39; DONE, SON. Scratch that off the list!</p>

Had to subscribe to Creative Cloud for After Effects to make it happen, but now I have more of a compulsory reason to do video stuff since I&#39;m stuck to it for a year. Still, $20/mo for professional video software isn&#39;t terrible.</p>
<p>But enough rambling, here&#39;s the video. I apologize for the ending. It&#39;s just a thing.</p>
