I&#39;m hoping I can get a refund and if I can&#39;t get that I hope at least that these games won&#39;t fritz on me immediatly. But, my ALttP cart (which I learned is also pirated) hasn&#39;t gone nutzy on me yet, so maybe if I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ll still be playing these when I&#39;m 50 :-P.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve finished with my changes to the <a href="http://www.parishofstpeter.net">parish site</a>. I had a fun journey into RSS land and the nightmares of PHP&#39;s XML handling came back to haunt me as well :-P. I also decided to put up scanned copies of the bulletin due to the format changes it undergoes each week. It makes me look like a hypocrite because a couple weeks ago the guy who runs the Our Lady of Guadelupe site was on my case for not getting the bulletin up-to-date and was talking about how he just scanned theirs in. I stupidly answered &quot;Nah, that&#39;s cheating. I couldn&#39;t do that.&quot; Well, I did it. However, in my defense, I have a high quality, lossless scan whereas his, well, <a href="http://www.ourladyofguadalupe-dewey.org/bulletin.htm">you make the call</a>.</p>
<p>This afternoon mom and I are going to look at houses (my opinion is highly valued ;-)). With any luck we&#39;ll find something spacious enough for us at a decent price. Maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll post on how all that went, but until then...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Canon to Real Life</h2><time>July 27, 2005</time><div><p>It seems I may be launched from my protective shelter at home with my family right into &quot;real&quot; life soon (what is &quot;real&quot;? ;-)). I&#39;m currently being considered for a job at Gamespot/TV.com/MP3.com doing web work for them. Now that in itself is cool but it would mean relocating to San Fransico (a good several hundred miles from here). It&#39;s kind of an exciting thought, though. Finally making my own money, putting aside worries of my future at least for the time being.</p>
<p>In other news, I&#39;m getting the parish site up to speed again (basically the last job that really needs to be done) and I&#39;m going to rewrite my GBA bowling program. I&#39;ve been trying to think of a game to write, but it hasn&#39;t been coming lately. Oh well.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been having some nasty hankering to play old Mario World again (probably thanks to my last write up). So, after collecting some money from VB.NET, I bought it for my beloved GBA :-). Of course, you can&#39;t have Mario World 1 without Mario World 2 (aka Yoshi&#39;s Island) so I got it too :-). Now my game collection should be complete (though Mario Kart would be fun and the Wario Ware games look like a blast :-D).</p>
<p>And, this just in, we finally found a AC adapter for the old keyboard and now I can start teaching myself how to play :-).</p>
<p>Well, I shall sign off for the night. Maybe next time I&#39;ll put up my next autobiographical installment.</p>
