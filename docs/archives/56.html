Anybody who has perused this blog for more than five minutes is acutely aware of this. One thing I did in August &#39;09 was to add play stat tracking in so I could see what had been listened to when. Now that this functionality has been in for a full calendar, I&#39;ve culled all the data to present a bunch of pure CSS graphs filled with 2010&#39;s listening habits.</p>[break]

Any kind of original documentation that resided on Lik-sang where I oriinally released MPSS is now gone (thanks, Sony) so, I&#39;m here to provide a real tutorial as there seems to be interest for the old skinner that I didn&#39;t realize still existed. So, here is the official MP Skin Studio tutorial, brought to you by dxprog. I&#39;ll go through the entire process making a real skin as I go.[break]</p>
<p>What you&#39;ll need:
MP Skin Studio [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/docs/MPSkinStudio.zip">download</a> ]
The GIMP [ <a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/">download</a> ] (or any other imaging software that can create 256 color bitmaps). This tutorial will be written with GIMP in mind
VisualBasic runtimes [ <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=7b9ba261-7a9c-43e7-9117-f673077ffb3c&amp;displaylang=en">download</a> ] - Only needed if you get some DLL missing errors when running MP Skin Studio.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-creating-your-images">Step 1 - Creating Your Images</h2>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll need to do before even opening MPSS is to create all the images for your skin. Here&#39;s a list of everything there is to create:</p>
<p><strong>Backgrounds - 240x160</strong>
There are four different backgrounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>main</li>
<li>file</li>
<li>e-book</li>
<li>music
All background are 256 color images. More on this in a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main icons - 64x64</strong>
There are six different icons that go on the main screen. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>movie</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>picture</li>
<li>game</li>
<li>e-book</li>
<li>help/setup
These icons share the same 256 color palette as the background images. Again, more later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>File icons - 16x16</strong>
There are two small icons used for the file screen, one for directories and one for going back a level. These share the same 256 color palette as the file background.</p>
<p>So, after you&#39;ve gathered up all your images (assuming you&#39;re not creating them from scratch, which I won&#39;t be), we&#39;ll need to take them into GIMP for cropping and color reduction, which I will now explain :)</p>
<p><strong>256 colors? Palettized? What now?</strong>
For anybody who&#39;s never messed around with palettized file formats, this part will be the most annoying. Without going into too much technical detail, the GBA can only display so many colors at a given time to save on space and speed up render times. This means take our images, which could have a possible 38,400 colors and reduce them down to 256. This is where the GIMP comes in.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-simple-background">Making a Simple Background</h2>
<p>We need to take a different approach for creating backgrounds that have icons and those that don&#39;t, though if you&#39;re feeling lazy you can use this method for all of them and MPSS will do it&#39;s best to make things look all pretty. Enough preamble, let&#39;s fire up GIMP. It&#39;ll take a while to start up the first time, but with some patience you should see something like this once it&#39;s done:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg</a> &quot;Kind of like this, but with less Toradora! Christmas wallpaper&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>First you&#39;ll need to crop up your background image, so click File-&gt;Open, navigate to where you&#39;ve saved the image you want and click open. It should now display in the main GIMP window. This is the image I will be using for this tutorial:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg</a> &quot;Thank you for donating your likeness, Nagisa!&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve got your image ready, it&#39;s time to crop. In the tool window, click the drop tool (or press Shift+C). You&#39;ll want to check &quot;Fixed Aspect Ration&quot; and make sure it&#39;s set to 240x160:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_crop_tool.jpg" alt="" title="Crop tool settings"></p>
<p>Select the area you want to crop your background to and press enter. Now we need to resize the image to 240x160. To do that, click Image-&gt;Scale Image using 240x160 as your size:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_resize.jpg" alt="" title="Resizing the image"></p>
<p>Now we&#39;re ready to convert this to 256 colors. Click Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Indexed. Make sure &quot;Generate optimum palette&quot; is checked and set to 256 colors. You can mess around with dithering if you like to test different results, but I usually leave it off (personal preference). Here&#39;s what the settings window should look like:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_palette.jpg" alt="" title="Reducing the colors"></p>
<p>Our image is now ready for importing into MPSS! Here is what the final product looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_final.jpg" alt="" title="All ready to go"></p>
<p>Before we can take the next step, however, we must save this. So click File-&gt;Save As. You&#39;ll want to save this as a BMP file, so select Windows BMP Bitmap from the format drop down:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_save.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_save.jpg</a> &quot;Save options&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>Name your file appropriately (with a .bmp extension) and click save. You&#39;ll be nagged with a window asking if you want to save with run-length encoding. Leave this unchecked and press OK.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you can create all your backgrounds this way, but to get the icons looking all nice we&#39;ll need to go a step further. First, let&#39;s create some icons.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-icon">Creating an Icon</h2>
<p>The steps to create an icon are very similar. In fact, it&#39;s just changing a couple of values. So, here they are:</p>
<p>Cropping: set your ratio to 1:1 instead of 240:160
Scaling: Depending on which icon, you&#39;ll use 64x64 or 16x16 when scaling your image (see above reference for which icons use what size).
Transparency: If you would like an icon to have a transparent part, you&#39;ll need to select a color will be the transparent color and paint any areas you want transparent with that color (I use the pencil tool with a 1 pixel brush). I usually use an unsightly green, like so:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_ushio.jpg" alt="" title="A demonstration of transparency"></p>
<p>Done!</p>
<h2 id="making-a-background-w-icons">Making a Background w/ Icons</h2>
<p>Here is where things can get a little tedius. This step needs to be performed BEFORE you set your image to 256 colors. With your background and icons all open, start copying all of your icons to your background image on new layers. Here&#39;s how we do that. On your icon, select the entire canvas by press Ctl+A and the press Ctl+C to copy. Now, move over to your background image and press Ctl+V. Your icon should appear in the middle of the screen. We want this on a new layer, so now click the New Layer button in the layers window:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_layers.jpg" alt="" title="Click new layer after pasting"></p>
<p>Note - It doesn&#39;t matter where your icons are placed, just as long as they&#39;re there.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve gotten all your icons pasted over, reduce the colors as before. Your icons and background are now using the same palette and will look all pretty for your skin. Now we need to save out all of our images. First, start with the background. Hide all of the icon layers by click the little eyeball icon next to it in the layers window:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_visibility.jpg" alt="" title="The eyeballs turn layers on/off"></p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve hidden these, save the background image as above. Now to do all the icons. Turn all your icons back on in the layers window reversing what we did before. Now, right click on the layer with your icon and click &quot;Alpha to Selection.&quot; Click Ctl+C to copy the icon to the clipboard. Now click File-&gt;Create-&gt;From Clipboard. Your icon should show up. Sadly, the palette information isn&#39;t carried over in the copy, so you&#39;ll need to switch the mode to indexed again. Now save your icon as a BMP as before.</p>
<p>After all your icons and backgrounds have been sized, palettized and saved, we&#39;re ready to put it all together in MPSS!</p>
<h2 id="pulling-it-all-together">Pulling it all together</h2>
<p>Now that all the graphics have been prepared, we&#39;re ready to pull it all together in MP Skin Studio. So, open it up and you&#39;ll be greeted with the following screen:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_startup.jpg" alt="" title="MP Skin Studio"></p>
<p><strong>The Main Screen</strong>
Since the main screen covers most all areas of MPSS&#39; functionality, we&#39;ll start there and fill in where needed. First thing we&#39;ll do is load up our background. To do this, click the large black square in the center of the window and you will be prompted to select your background image. Pick the image you made for the main screen and it will display in the black area we just clicked:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_background.jpg" alt="" title="The background loaded"></p>
<p>Done! Now we&#39;ll load up all our icons. These are all lined up on the right side of the screen under the &quot;Icons&quot; text (surprised?). These aren&#39;t set right now, so they appear as white squares. Above each square is the name of each icon (movie, music, etc). To load an icon image, <strong>right-click</strong> the icon you want to load and select your bitmap from the resulting dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_icon.jpg" alt="" title="Icon loaded"></p>
<p>Now, as can be noted by the tell-tale ugly green color, this icon was intended to have transparency, so we need to tell MPSS that this color is supposed to be transparent. To do this, select the color dropper tool:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_dropper.jpg" alt="" title="The dropper tool"></p>
<p>Now, <strong>right-click</strong> the color you wish to be transparent on your icon. This color will now be replaced with a color checker background indicating transparency:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_transparency.jpg" alt="" title="Transparency in an icon"></p>
<p>Rinse and repeat this step for all of your icons. Note that you do not need to set an image for any icon if you wish. That said, I&#39;m going to use only the one icon for this demonstration. Now that we&#39;ve loaded all of our icons, it&#39;s time to place them on the screen. To do this, click and drag an icon to the position you&#39;d like it be on the background:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_position.jpg" alt="" title="Positioning an icon"></p>
<p>The &quot;location&quot; label underneath the background image will update with the current X and Y coordinate to allow you more precision. Again, rinse and repeat this process for all icons. Any icon you do not place will default to position 0, 0. There a couple things to note before we move on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Icon text: this allows your skin to display (or not) the captions that appear underneath the icons:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_text.jpg" alt="" title="Toggling text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bounding box: this is an editor feature. Enable this will draw a box around all of the icons to help in positioning them:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_box.jpg" alt="" title="Icon with bounding box drawn"></p>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve finished the icons, it&#39;s time to set font colors. You&#39;ll find this area in the bottom left of the window. There are three different font colors to set. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu text: this is the text that appears on the main and file screens.</li>
<li>Highlighted text: Highlighted versions of the above text items.</li>
<li>E-book/help text: Text that appears for e-books and in the help section.</li>
</ul>
<p>To set the font color, simply click the color block to the right of the item you want to change. Select your color from the color picker dialog and click OK. Done!</p>
<p><strong>Odds and Ends</strong>
All the other screens utilize what we&#39;ve just done for the main screen, but I&#39;ll run through them real quick. To switch to a different screen, click on one of the gray pills at the top that read &quot;Main&quot;, &quot;File&quot;, &quot;E-Book&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;. You&#39;ll notice that as you click through these, the background image will change. To set the background image for a screen, just click on the large box as we did above. Even though they&#39;re still displayed, there are no large icons associated with these other screens with the exception of the file icons.</p>
<p>After you&#39;ve set the &quot;File&quot; background image, you can load in your file icons. To do this, right click on the white box to the right of &quot;Folder&quot; or &quot;Back&quot; underneath &quot;File Icons&quot; and load in your icon. Setting icon transparency works the same as it does for large icons, using the dropper tool and right-clicking the color you wish to be transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Up</strong>
Once you&#39;ve gotten all your graphics loaded, positioned and such we&#39;re ready to save our skin. Click File-&gt;Save BACKIMG. Be sure to name your file BACKIMG.ext where ext can be whatever you want. If you&#39;ve chosen to leave out some backgrounds or icons you may receive a warning. Just click OK and it&#39;ll save anyways. You&#39;re now ready to put your skin onto your GBAMP or M3!</p>
<h2 id="errata">Errata</h2>
<p>During the writing of this tutorial I&#39;ve encountered more than a few bugs. As I originally wrote this software six years ago, I can&#39;t offer much in the way of support in terms of fixing them (I&#39;m missing at least one source file :(). However, I will list what I discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having the bounding box enabled prevents you from loading in a new background. Just disable it and all is good.</li>
<li>Changing an icon&#39;s transparent color more than once will result in errouneous display.</li>
<li>If you open/create a skin that has all icons and then try to save a skin that is missing some icons, the missing icons will be replaced with the ones from the previous skin. You can clear this by deleting all the files in PROGRAM_FOLDER\temp where PROGRAM_FOLDER is where you&#39;ve extracted MPSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find any other issues, please e-mail me at matt@dxprog.com. If there&#39;s enough demand, I might find my way to rewriting this piece of software, but no promises.</p>
<p>Happy skinning!</p>

Let&#39;s suspend our disbelief for a second.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for Inception</strong> - As the movie states, the dreamer must be three layers deep for Inception to work. This requirement is met if one considers each ghost of Christmas it&#39;s own layer (past, present, future). Of course, this requires a particular level of sedation. Scrooge complains of indigestion, so his food could easily have been drugged. By whom? Marley, of course. His ghostly face appeared on the knocker of Scrooge&#39;s house, so we know he&#39;d already been there.</p>
<p><strong>The time required</strong> - At the end of the story, Scrooge is surprised that the spirits managed to do everything in one night. He easily satisfies that thought with a &quot;Oh, they&#39;re spirits. They can do whatever they like.&quot; Inception tells us that a dream is several times faster than real time and each level of dream adds to that. This allows for an exponential amount of time especially as Scrooge was three layers in.</p>
<p><strong>The setup</strong> - Everything up till now is good, but here&#39;s where things get tricky. One would think that the layers of dreaming would go in the order presented in the story: past, preset, future. However, careful observation of the time each layer tells us that the opposite is true. Past takes the longest, so it has to be the last level of dream with present and future going up the chain. There is a complication that this brings: in future (first layer of dream) Scrooge remembers present and past. There are two possible explanations:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Most probable - Scrooge, upon entering the future, is immediately put to sleep. Upon entering in present, the same happens. This kicks him automatically to the third layer where everything can play out working backwards.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Scrooge is actually experiencing all three dreams at the same time, each layer&#39;s experiences adding to the previous in real time. Since the bottom layers play out much faster then the previous, all the information required would be in place for the story to play out as seen.</p>
<p><strong>Whodunnit?</strong> - Given we assume all of the above is true, who is the person that started the whole thing? Who is the architect. A simple question - Jacob Marley. He&#39;s already a ghost, let&#39;s face it, but his closeness to Scrooge puts him at an advantage to know all the key points to hit upon.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. It seems Christopher Nolan&#39;s seemingly original idea was actually conceived by literary genius Charles Dickens in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Or perhaps I just have too much time on my hands...</p>

As I am wont to do, I watched anime again and I am here to review it for you, my fine reading populace. However, my anime watchings is not something I do alone with a bucket of Haagan Daas in hand. I watch it while downing manly drinks and filling myself with sugar in the company of a couple of my many brothers. So, this year, I&#39;m turning this series of reviews into a family affair. Since they missed out last year, we&#39;ll also be touching on some stuff I&#39;ve already reviewed. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="outlaw-star">Outlaw Star</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_outlaw_star.jpg" alt="" title="Outlaw Star">
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
Another entry in a long line of 90s space westerns. Gene Starwind and Jim Hawkings are the purveyors of a business that handles various odd jobs (think Han Solo). Through one of these jobs, they find themselves with a highly advanced spaceship which leads to many a crazy space adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
I do not have many kind words for Outlaw Star. The largest problem with this show was the plot, They set things up for something large and arcing in the first couple episodes, but then dropped it until the last two. Everything in between is useless filler that doesn&#39;t do anything for the plot or characters. Adding to that, the dub was bad and the visuals were inconsistent at best. At least it had one good closer song. <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
Don&#39;t watch this shit, dude. Most of time it&#39;s going nowhere, and when it is moving foreward, it only does so in small steps that are completely outweighed by the amount of useless drivel that serves only to bore or annoy you. <strong>-?/10</strong>. No, I do not think my score is harsh.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Outlaw Star?  More like Outhouse Stall.
I can&#39;t count how many times this show promised something more and then turned around and kicked me in the balls.  Throw in some super annoying characters and crappy character designs and you have one of the worst shows ever made, not even taking into consideration the beach episode(in a sci-fi show?) which scarred my eyes in ways razor blades and nails never could.
I&#39;ll give it a point for the accurate physics on that prison planet, though. <strong>1/10</strong>

<h2 id="k-on-">K-ON!</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_kon.jpg" alt="" title="K-ON!">
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
K-ON! follows the day to day happenings of four students at an all girl school who have formed a music club/band.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
There isn&#39;t really much to say about this show. Much like Azumanga Daioh, it&#39;s just a slice of life show that kind of, but doesn&#39;t really go anywhere. It&#39;s pretty much fluff for fluff&#39;s sake and that makes it easy to ingest. The characters, while stereotypical anime fare, are enjoyable and offer up a few chuckle worthy moments. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
&quot;K-ON!&quot; is entertaining, to say the least. And that&#39;s all I have to say on the matter. <strong>7/0</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
K-ON! is a show about cute girls in a high-school music club... and that&#39;s pretty much it.  Those looking for simple things like a plot should look elsewhere, but for those who just want a fun, light-hearted romp, this is a good choice.
While not really unique -- all of them conforming to the usual archetypes -- the characters are all likeable and work well together.  Throw in superb Kyoto Animation character designs and some good songs, and you have solid entertainment that never tries to turn serious on you.  And sometimes, that&#39;s all you need in a show. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="higurashi-no-naku-koro-ni-and-kai-">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (and Kai)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_higurashi.jpg" alt="" title="Higurashi no Naku Koro ni">
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
Keiichi Maebara moves to the remote village of Hinamizawa in the summer of 1983 when weird things begin happening. Everybody clamors on about Oyashiro&#39;s curse, but is there more afoot?</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
Higurashi is what you get when you combine cute moe with myster/thriller. It draws a lot of parallels to my favorite episode of Next Generation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">Cause and Effect</a>). All the loops culminate with everybody dying and we&#39;re shown a few loops from multiple perspectives. Nothing is really solved until season 2, but it has a lot of great edge of your seat moments and some characters who seemed kind of obscure initially turn out to be pretty important. This show is just some really good myster/sci-fi. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
When a show begins with the gruesome murder of two girls by a crazed classmate with a baseball bat, you know shit is going to get real. And it does. Twisted and confusing at first, but wholesomely satisfying by the end, &quot;Higurashi&quot; is filled with adventure, mystery, and horror that leave you on the egde of your seat. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Given my love for shows with cute girls, this one seemed like a no brainer.  Then I found it was a horror deal, which gave me feelings of &quot;eeeeaahhg&quot;.  Then I saw the first episode and was all like, &quot;MOAR&quot;.
Higurashi may seem like an odd show on paper, with the way that it switches from light-hearted comedy fair to the much darker horror aspects.  But the creators pulled it off remarkably well, making for a show that&#39;s light fun one moment, then dark and disturbing the next.
The plot is engaging from beginnning to end, with everything starting out shrouded in mystery, but as time goes by and the questions are answered things are sown together to create an intricate story that culminates in a satisfying ending.  All of this is helped along by a large cast of likeable characters, each with intersting back stories of their own.
Overall, Higurashi is one of the best anime I&#39;ve seen, and it certainly ranks in my top shows of the year. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="trigun">Trigun</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_trigun.jpg" alt="" title="Trigun">
[b]<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-2/#break">Matt</a>[/b]
I watched Trigun as the result of a deal with one of my many, many brothers. The stage is set on some distant planet with an old west style theme. The story is told from the perspective of a couple of girls working for an insurance claims department as they follow the world reknowned outlaw, Vash the Stampede. It feels like Trigun tries to tackle too many issues at once, attempting to be episodic while having a larger story arc. The further the show goes on, the more things fall apart, but I&#39;ll cut it some slack as the manga went into hiatus in the middle of animation. All in all, it&#39;s good but not great. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
In all honesty, I have a soft spot for the wild west. I like the idea of cowboys and outlaws, showdowns at high noon and spending time drinking in a saloon between gunfights. If you add space travel science fiction, manmade sentient biological power sources who run amok with mechanical limbs, ridiculous killing techniques, overpowered revolvers and shit and you have yourself a winner. At times lighthearted and at others completely serious, &quot;Trigun&quot; is a must watch/read in my opinion, always entertaining while still giving you something to think about. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Set on a planet far from Earth where mankind has built up into a society much like the wild west, Trigun has an appealing premise.  From the sets and the characters everything feels as though you&#39;ve stepped into nineteenth century western America.
Unfortunately, the plot isn&#39;t as well thought out as the setting.  While not bad, it takes a while to warm up, and even when it does it often times ends up dragging its feet.  By the time you&#39;ve reached the end, the plot hasn&#39;t had enough time to develop itself fully and ends up falling flat.  Combine this with lackluster animation and oftentimes awkward character designs and things aren&#39;t looking too good.
Thankfully, most of the characters are likeable, especially Vash, who is light-hearted and fun most of the time, but can be serious if necessary, although oftentimes he comes off as a pussy.
However, in the end, the show doesn&#39;t live up to it&#39;s true potential, which is truly a shame. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="azumanga-daioh">Azumanga Daioh</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_azumanga_daioh.jpg" alt="" title="Azumanga Daioh">
<strong>Matt</strong>
Watch my review of Azumanga Daioh <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-taste-of-things-to-come/">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
Highschool girls? Check. Insane teacher? Check. Weird english speaking cat who fathered a human? Check. Implied bestiality? Double check that shit. What about a G rating(or maybe E10+)? Yeah, it gets that, too. Somehow... <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Azumanga Daioh is, in many ways, similar to K-ON!, with it&#39;s focus being on cute high-school girls, but ultimately excels in ways that latter does not.
While most of the characters are reminiscent of your usual anime archetypes, they  manage to set themselves apart from their peers, all of them being well-written and playing off eachother perfectly.  Tomo and Ms. Yukari spring to mind in this case, both being good characters in their own right, but soaring to new heights when playing off of other characters and giving them Hell.
With its focus on character driven comedy, Azumanga Daioh is a must see for any anime fan.  If you watch this and don&#39;t walk away smiling, you have no soul. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p>Remember, as the title suggests this is only part one. There&#39;s at least one, possible two more to come. Stay tuned!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Relaunch... again!</h2><time>December 14, 2010</time><div><p>After many, many months of development and fretting over design, I&#39;ve finally completed the latest iteration of dxprog.com! There&#39;s quite a bundle of changes in this version both under the hood and... over it? Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New look</strong> The most obvious change is, of course, the new look. I&#39;ve opted to go for a super clean look with more attention paid to the textual layout.</li>
<li><strong>Unified content model</strong> This means that items from my portfolio, artwork, videos or blog can all be displayed in the same list yet be treated differently for display. It reduces a lot of code and makes for a much nicer, streamlined presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Commenting upgrades</strong> In addition to being able to use your twitter account to sign-in, there&#39;s now the option of Facebook and anonymous. Also, comments are broken down into pages of fifty (there&#39;s <a href="http://matthackmann.net/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows">only one post</a> where you can see this in action).</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> I&#39;ve done a lot of changes to the backend structure to enhance load times. The average load time as I&#39;m writing this is well under a tenth of a second.</li>
<li><strong>Comics</strong> As much as I loathe some of those comics, dxprog.com is meant to be a repository of all my work. As such, you can view the entire Digital Double archive by clicking &quot;Comics&quot; up on the top nav. I&#39;m going to work on getting the newer stuff in as I finish importing content.</li>
<li><strong>Sidebars</strong> There have been many tweaks and additions made to the various sidebars. The first I&#39;d like to point out is the &quot;Most Popular&quot; which, as the name implies, is a listing of the current most popular items on the site. Another interesting one is &quot;Last Listend To&quot; which displays the last song I&#39;ve listened to through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. Finally, the archives and tag clouds have been given some nice overhauls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these are just the noticable differences. The amount of changes in the codebase are wide sweeping and quite substantial, but will allow for a much more maintainable codebase in the future. I plan on releasing the source within the next month or so after I&#39;ve had a opportunity to watch it in the wild and fully document it. Until then, I hope you enjoy the new site. If you&#39;re having issues or have a suggestion, please feel free to leave comment!</p>
