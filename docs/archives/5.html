Giving myself four minutes out of the gate, this time. And... WE&#39;RE OFF!</p>
<p>The easiest thing to start this off on is my day. Or my weekend? We&#39;ll stick with day, it&#39;s a lot shorter and I only have so much time.</p>
<p>Attempted to move the voltage converter circuit off the breadboard and onto a circuit board. Got everything designed up in Eagle, fidgeted with the printer for a bit because printers suck, and then attempted to iron it onto a copper board. Well.... that didn&#39;t go so great, so maybe I&#39;ll just solder everything up on a perfboard. Still, I want to get this etching shit figured out.</p>
<p>Other things I did today was gorge on &#39;Nilla Wafers. There are a lot of things I would say are &quot;krytonite-esque&quot; for me, but &#39;Nilla Wafers are the real deal. I fucking love these things and always have. They&#39;re cookies, clearly, but there&#39;s something special in their simplicity. The way the crumble under the pressure of your tongue as the spit in your mouth begins to slowly dissolve the cookie. The rush of flavor that dances across your taste buds as those little crumbles brush past. Oh, what&#39;s this? Looks like somebody has decided to douse the whole scene in some lovely, lovely milk. The flavors are mingling together, creating an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. You savor the -</p>
<p>TIME&#39;S UP!</p>
<p>Guess I had a bit of a Remy from Ratatouille moment, there. Play with matches only if you&#39;re going to do something cool... like set things on fire!</p>

Instead, here&#39;s a video of a thing I&#39;ll be writing about <em>very</em> soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16qvLoxmdak&amp;youtube-thumb"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/16qvLoxmdak/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/1-and-2-a-and-b">1 and 2, A and B</a></h1><time class="post__published">November 11, 2016</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>The last couple years or so, I&#39;ve been on a big Alan Parsons Project kick. This no doubt stemmed from my dad getting me a compilation album for Christmas. Since, I&#39;ve purchased most of the albums on LP and have listened to them quite often. The aforementioned compilation set gets frequent playback in the car, which means I&#39;m listening to it a lot because the Bay&#39;s commute traffic is awful.</p>
<p>When listening to an artist so much, you start to pick up on things they like to do. One of these I noticed about Alan Parsons Project is what I&#39;m going to call &quot;setup, opposite comparator&quot; (or SOC). Over the course of a verse, a series of back-to-back comparisons (often opposites) are made. Here&#39;s a bunch of examples:</p>
<h2 id="what-goes-up-pyramid-">What goes up... (Pyramid)</h2>
<p><em>What goes up, must come down</em>
<em>What must rise, must fall</em></p>
<h2 id="gemeni-eye-in-the-sky-">Gemeni (Eye in the Sky)</h2>
<p><em>Watching, waiting</em>
<em>Rising, falling</em>
<em>Listening, calling</em>
...
<em>Touching, feeling</em>
<em>Seeing, believing</em></p>
<h2 id="psychobabble-eye-in-the-sky-">Psychobabble (Eye in the Sky)</h2>
<p><em>It ain&#39;t Kodachrome and it isn&#39;t black and white</em>
...
<em>Well, I&#39;m never on my own but there&#39;s nobody in sight</em>
...
<em>It&#39;s in Dolby stereo but I never hear it right</em>
...
<em>Well, I see the way to go but there isn&#39;t any light</em></p>
<p>and the Queen Mother of all of them is <em>You Don&#39;t Believe</em> which I won&#39;t write down, because the whole song is a series of SOCs. Check for yourself:</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed a few of these, but those were the one&#39;s off the top of my head. It&#39;s an interesting hallmark of the group for sure.</p>

Instead, here&#39;s a non-edited, slightly stoned, 100% stream of consciousness that was typed over the course of two minutes starting... NOW!</p>
<p>As I hit the enter key, &quot;Stay Alive&quot; (the last ED for Re:Zero) started playing. I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;m probably waning on favor of this song. It&#39;s a good song, no doubt, but I have a hunch I won&#39;t be listening to it in a week.</p>
<p>Speaking of a week, I came up with a hair brained scheme. In my 1:1 with my manager tomorrow, I&#39;m going to pitch the idea of working remotely in Japan for 3-6 months. I think it&#39;d effectively scratch that itch, because I do love that country so much. People talk about having home sickness, well I&#39;ve had this feeling only a couple of times:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2008 when I was in college and about to leave back for Orlando following Christmas break</li>
<li>Every single God. Damned. Time I come back from Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t know what it is about being over there that feels so right, but I want to have the opportunity to test if it&#39;s just me following the &quot;high&quot; of something new or if I really resonate with life over there that much.</p>
<p>Okay, so the timer went off while writing the above bit, but I had to finish it and added a couple of minutes. I suppose I can bullshit until it goes off...</p>
<p>Sheep are weird, right? They&#39;re both meat AND clothing. That&#39;s not weird, I suppose. Pigs and cows provide leather, after all. And that&#39;s like... a car delicacy.</p>
<p>Oh shit! The timer went off.</p>
<p>Alright, folks. Remember to drive safely and that drugs are bad, m&#39;kay.</p>

While getting there, I ran into this gem of a photo:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/img/ad_content/kitchen_images/20171_nkdp10a_04PH135990.jpg" alt="" title="COPYRIGHT IKEA COM INT"></p>
<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>Why is she holding a dirty spoon? She&#39;s clearly not cooking as can be noted by the exceptionally clean counters.</p>
<p>What exactly is she doing? Singing into her dirty spoon?</p>
<p>Where is the oven? Were there any dishes around, I&#39;d expect to see maybe a chocolate cake or brownies... but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a place to cook them.</p>
<p>Her outfit seems very 90s. Denim jumper thing with leggings. Hell, the might even be stirrup pants and the stirrups are covered by socks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a curious thing.</p>
