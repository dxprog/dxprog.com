Seeing as I am planning on paying for such a trip within the next couple of years, I figured it&#39;d be worth a shot to try and get one for free. Granted, my art skills are probably nowhere near the level of the more devoted and talented frequenters of ANN, but hey. Never hurts to try. So, here&#39;s my entry for your viewing pleasure/horror.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Rise From Your Grave - Chainploder</h2><time>November 19, 2010</time><div><p>I was poking around my giant hard drive a couple days ago, looking at a bunch of old programming projects I&#39;d done. Some of these had some pretty cool concepts behind them but, for whatever reason, I never completed them. So, in a series of blog posts shamelessly ripping a line of dialog from Altered Beast, I will present to you some of the cooler of these projects - complete with all their original source code. Today&#39;s highlight is Chainploder.[break]</p>
<p>Chainploder is, in its essence, a blatent rip off of some game I saw on digg and then again on Facebook. This game consisted of a playing field full of bouncing circles and you had to clear a certain amount of them by starting a chain reaction from a single point. I figured this would be a pretty simple thing to code, so I got on Skype and spun up another coding challenge with my bro  (as I am wont to do). I don&#39;t recall all the details, but I don&#39;t think I spent much more than an hour working on this.</p>

<p>As you can see, my weapon of choice was Flash (I was into that at the time). You may also notice that the game buggy and crappy. Granted, it&#39;s not terrible for 162 lines of code.</p>
<p>So, there is my first highlight. This is probably the most recent project of the things I will showcase later, and probably one of the only ones that won&#39;t be Visual Basic. But, I believe it&#39;s a good kick off.</p>
<p>Oh, you can get the source here: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.fla">Download</a> (Flash CS4)</p>
