I&#39;ve been dicking around with some simple projects, but on of the things that I&#39;ve been eagerly looking forward to doing is a computer controlled Christmas lights setup. There are some selfish reasons, I&#39;ll admit, like winning the company Christmas decorations contest. But, I digress.</p>
<p>To that end, I horked some code from a Taiko no Tatsujin clone I&#39;d been writing a few years ago and tossed the output at the Arduino via serial data. Here&#39;s the result:</p>

<p>Code is after the break!

Perhaps it&#39;d be more challenging to actually create new content for an entire month, but I&#39;m too lazy for that.</p>
<p>Instead, you get random scraps of things I started and never completed from my sketch books. So, yeah. Enjoy that. Or have a beer. Or have a beer and then enjoy that.</p>

This was the first thing I drew with the complimentary box of Crayons I got from Crayola. I was not in the least bit bitter.

I have redesigned and relaunched this website. Granted, I managed to go nearly two years without touching it. That&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s new? Outside of an enormous code reworking to take into account the wonderful new OOP changes in PHP 5.3 and the obvious new look, here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive design: not everything has this treatment (art page), but all the main pages should display themselves nicely no matter what device you view them on.</li>
<li>Threaded comments: if you reply to a message, your reply will display underneath, <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/useless-justification/#comments">like this</a>.</li>
<li>Removal of SSO for comments: no more twitter, no more facebook. Gravatar is also used for avatars.</li>
<li>Better lightbox: every image in a blog post will display in a lightbox when clicked (larger if there happens to be a larger image). This same lightbox is also used for the art page</li>
<li>Art page is all pintresty. Because, hey, why not.</li>
<li>Content reorganization: gone is the video tab, here is the &quot;code&quot; tab with all sorts of random code projects of mine.</li>
<li>Popular art module. That&#39;s new.</li>
<li>Cloud tag has been removed.</li>
<li>Archives is a list again and smarter in that it will select what year to show depending on the context of the page you&#39;re on.</li>
<li>Code snippets use the Solarized theme</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#39;s what&#39;s new on the front end. As stated, most of the fun stuff is all in the code changes. And, for the first time ever, you can see the code that&#39;s running this site on its <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/DxCMS">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/useless-justification">Useless Justification</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 27, 2012</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/the_bed.jpg" alt="" title="My dojo of solitude"></p>
<p>One of the things that seems to come up with some frequency at work is the size of my bed. I don&#39;t know how or why, but there it is.</p>
<p>Anyways, I sleep in a twin bed and one of my coworkers can&#39;t quite comprehend how I can sleep in a bed so small. My general response is it takes up less space and I&#39;m the only one sleeping in it (also, it&#39;s <em>fucking comfortable</em>). I also have a reverse claustrophobia when it comes to beds: the larger they are, the more uncomfortable I am. But, today as I was lying comfortable in said bed, I realized that there is a more objective way to prove my twin bed is more awesome than all other beds: it&#39;s widescreen.</p>
<p>We all know that widescreen is the preferred video format of choice these days as it closer matches the aspect ratio of our own vision; we can see a wider field of view than we can in height. Here&#39;s some aspect ratios of common video formats:</p>
<p>Anamorphic widescreen (film) - 2.39:1
HDTV, aka 16:9 - 1.78:1
SDTV, aka 4:3 - 1.33:1</p>
<p>These are width to height ratios, so let&#39;s take that and apply them to standard bed sizes:</p>
<p>Twin - 1.92:1
Full - 1.38:1
Queen - 1.33:1</p>
<p>As you can see, twin falls right in between film and HDTV, which is a particularly awesome place to be. However, the larger beds are all standard definition (with queen size being right on the money). We all know how much standard definition sucks.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ll be on my modern day standards sized bed.</p>
