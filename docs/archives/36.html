<p>So, in the stead of a video, here are photos of the peanut butter cookies I made after midnight last night. I had a hankering for cookies and, seeing as I have barred myself from stepping foot back in Wal-Mart again this week, conjured these up. I make the rules and if I decide I want cookies, I&#39;ll make some cookies regardless of the hour.</p>

</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/lunch-musings-november-11-2011">Lunch Musings - November 11, 2011</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 9, 2012</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>I was walking on my lunch break as I oft do and I saw sign with &quot;11-1-11&quot; scribbled on the back. This reminded me of the big stink that nerds raised last year on 11-11-11 and how it was the &quot;last binary date of our generation&quot;.</p>
<p>But, nerds. You should know this wasn&#39;t true.</p>
<p>Yes, 111111 is 63 and, no, we&#39;re never going to encounter a date like that again in our lifetimes or in the next thousand years, for that matter. But for any nerd to try and assume that 11-11-11 is a valid date is stupid. There was this little thing a few years ago called Y2K.</p>
<p>You may recall it.</p>
<p>The whole issue with Y2K, for those who don&#39;t recall or never knew, was in the data depiction of years in a date. The first two digits were discarded and only the last two saved. Computers automatically stuffed a &quot;19&quot; in front and called it a day. Obviously, when those two stored digits were &quot;00&quot;, all the dates would read 1900 and there would be mass pandemonium.</p>
<p>But, since the crossing of the (almost) new millennium, we&#39;ve had to differentiate by storing the entire date, meaning all years would be stored/displayed as a four digit number.</p>
<p>So, in nerd terms, there never <em>was</em> a 11-11-11, just 11-11-2011 (or, 20111111 if you like being able to sort your dates numerically). And now that we can store dates ranging from 1/1/0001 to 12/31/9999, there was no excuse for the &quot;whooaaahh&quot; moment.</p>
<p>Now, January 19, 2038 03:14:08? <em>That&#39;s</em> something to look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">forward to</a>.</p>

It&#39;s a great place for comedy, feels, and elitism. As it turns out, it&#39;s also a great place for crazy awesome food ideas such as <a href="http://imgur.com/a/avjMU">pizza cupcakes</a>.</p>
<p>That photo series is scant on details, but there&#39;s really no recipe to follow here. I used the recipe on the back of a package of pizza yeast, stuffed into muffin tins, and filled with deliciousness - pizza sauce, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, and mozzarella (the stuff you find in the hispanic section, not shredded). Stuff in a 400F oven for 10-15 minutes (depending on how you like your crust) and you get amazingness:</p>

<p>As it turns out, FedEx delivers Tuesday through Saturday, so my lost weekend is less so.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been wanting a decent camera for some time as the point and shoots do not deliver the kind of quality I would prefer (and tend to fall apart rather quickly). I was actually planning on picking up a dSLR last year before the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/from-the-con-floor-day-1/">anime convention</a>, but, I couldn&#39;t find one for a decent enough price that also did video. The answer to that problem, apparently, is to simply wait a year.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now - still wanting a good camera for the con - and the camera I&#39;ve purchased, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J3V90Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p421_d6_g421_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=19H1SBQ8D7AXT6FGWZCS&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938811&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Canon Rebel T3i</a> retails for $750, well under the lower end numbers from last year. Toss in some clever shopping about and selling off of soon-to-be deprecated hardware (my old camcorder), and that $750 is brought down to a much more tolerable $350.</p>
<p>Even at $750, it would have been worth every goddamn penny. The picture above was taken with the flash <em>off</em> in my poorly lit bathroom. AND IT STILL LOOKS AMAZING (my troll face notwithstanding)!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not yet played around with the video option much, but expect some new movies this month now with fancy, movie style <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzC0Ek6X5FY">rack focus</a>!</p>

So, tonight I&#39;ll just repost this comment I left on reddit some days ago (because that&#39;s what we do):</p>
<p>My moronic roommate had invited some person from his class to stay at our place. I already hated my roommate, but I was in my last few months of college and it meant paying less, so I agreed to it.
Few days later, he&#39;s helping move the new guy&#39;s stuff in when he waddles into my room (overweight) all red in the face and out of breath. He asked if I would help get a couch up the stairs (we were on the second floor of the apartment complex). I reluctantly agreed and went out to help.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, I must explain how the stairs were laid out in the complex. There were two sets of stairs up: one with a bend half way up and one that went straight up. Here&#39;s a handy diagram:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1XpZX.jpg" alt="" title="A Diagram"></p>
<p>Gradients are stairs, red arrows how one gets up them.</p>
<p>So I walk out and see that they&#39;re trying to take the couch up the set of stairs with the bend and they were stuck getting it around the last corner. This is idiotic in and of itself as they could&#39;ve taken the straight stairs up and encountered no issues. It was the system of ropes and winches that literally caused my jaw to drop as I stared in disbelief for nearly a minute. The couch was actually dangling above the ground, anchored from the stairs going to the third floor.</p>
<p>I did wind up helping them get around the corner and immediately retreated to my room still in disbelief.</p>
