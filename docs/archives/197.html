If I recall correctly I complained about directing my younger brothers in the video. Well, I guess I can quit complaining... because now they&#39;re international movie stars!</p>

<p>This is taken from the pages of <a href="http://www.europanet.com.br/euro2003/modelos/exibe_img.php?img=/image_gen/resizeimg.php?cod_produto=75002&amp;size=w500">Ngamer Magazine (Brazil Edition)</a> and was kindly sent in by YouTuber, muzinfa (thanks, bro). It&#39;s quite awesome that somebody was tickled enough to put it in their publication but the fact that it also crossed the language barrier is doubley sweet.</p>

I did make a <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/202494/">comic</a> for Monday, though I hate it. Art&#39;s not bad, but... ugh.</p>
<p>However, this is not the reason I am posting. Nay! I&#39;ve completed what is probably my best work since my <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/55866864/">Maya</a> picture. Interestingly enough it started out as a <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/61854617/">practice sketch</a>, working on form and stuff. A few embellishments later it&#39;s a pretty cool sketch. Many hours, a few hair and grass tutorials later and it&#39;s this:

<p>One thing I&#39;ll say about it is I love the colors. It&#39;s bright and cheerful. I&#39;m really happy with it over all.</p>
