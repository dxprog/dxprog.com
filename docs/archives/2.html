The one thing I hadn&#39;t tried was the ever popular &quot;blow on the cartridge&quot; trick. It was the one thing that worked. I then proceeded to make a whole video of me playing it in the glitched up state...</p>

I don&#39;t regret my choice. It was a sweet movie with crazy effects and magic and some good old Marvel humor.</p>
<p>That said, it&#39;s now a bit late and I want a quick way out. So, here&#39;s a before and after photo of one of my recent broken NES aquisitions.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kW0U3hu.jpg" alt="" title="If you look closely, you can see a wire near the top right corner."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3Z3i8qw.jpg" alt="" title="SUCH A SHINY WITH THAT BLURRY DEPTH OF FIELD"></p>
<p>I have both of these machines, but the one on the right is the one in the after picture. The internals of the thing were fine, for the most part. The connector was shoddy as hell, though, so I refurb&#39;d the pins with a dental pick. After a little soak in the tub and a little scrubbing, it now plays games fabulously and <em>looks</em> fabulous too.</p>
<p>The one on the left has board issues of some sort, so when it does play at all, the graphics are all crazy go nuts. I wanted to grab a picture of Mario 3, but couldn&#39;t get the game to boot.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/that-time-i-resolved-a-copyright-complaint">That Time I Resolved a Copyright Complaint</a></h1><time class="post__published">November 17, 2016</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/that-time-i-got-to-file-a-copyright-claim/">yesterday&#39;s post</a>, I received an email from the company that produces the Ben Heck show. They were, of course, wondering what was up with the copyright claim and apologized since the production company switched between when the video was originally posted and now. The dude&#39;s name was Matt, so you know this is an an individual to be trusted.</p>
<p>Humor aside, I found working with him on the whole thing to be rather easy and pleasant. As stated above, he was apologetic, but professionally so. All he wanted was to have the video restored, all I wanted was an ask for permission and attribution. Over the course of a handful of emails, I retracted my copyright complaint, and the video reappeared on YouTube with one small change:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pNHr7su.png" alt="" title="That&#39;s my name, don&#39;t wear it out!"></p>
<p>Now that this whole issue has been nicely resolved, I can finally feel that little bit of accomplishment knowing that some of my design work is being seen hundreds of thousands of people and enticing them to watch the video.</p>
<p>Really, that&#39;s pretty cool.</p>

While I was there, I did things with Adobe programs. One of those things was a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/wherein-the-author-imparts-upon-his-audience-the-ongoings-of-his-life/">vectored NES</a>. That version is actually the second of two attempts for that class. My original was based off of an <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/nintendo_nes_1s.jpg">image I&#39;d found on google search</a> and it was fucking awful.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tCifkJ1.png" alt="" title="There&#39;s a reason it never got finished"></p>
<p>Unhappy with that, I took my own photo, getting the angles and such that I wanted.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Q7tGZh4.png" alt="" title="That&#39;s my DAD portfolio bag in the background"></p>
<p>Which, if you didn&#39;t click the blog link above, resulted in this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fmeztvu.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s actually not bad."></p>
<p>While I&#39;m here explaining the whole backstory, I will call attention to two things wrong with this image:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Nintendo&quot; has no registered trademark symbol.</li>
<li>&quot;Entertainment System&quot;, &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;Reset&quot;, and the controller port numbers are some computery looking system font that ships with OS X.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast forward nine years.</p>
<p>Recall in a post <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/hobbies-hobbies-hobbies/">a few days ago</a> where I mentioned how I was currently binging arcade repair videos (a thing I&#39;m still doing). That stemmed from just watching a bunch of electronics videos before that, and when you do this a lot, YouTube catches on and recommends other similar videos. One channel that&#39;s right up that alley is the <em>Ben Heck Show</em>, the long running electronic projects series by Internet famous console modder and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Video-Game-Consoles-ExtremeTech/dp/0764578065/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1479359208&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;keywords=ben+heck">published author</a>, Ben Heckendorn. So, consider my surprise when I&#39;m scrolling through recommendations and I see this:</p>
<p><img src="http://videos.revision3.com/revision3/images/shows/tbhs/0067/tbhs--0067--slot-loading-nintendo-game-system-part-1--marge.thumb.jpg" alt="" title="Mighty familiar..."></p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow, but didn&#39;t think too much of it at the time. I figured that it was just a really similar image or they&#39;d used the same photograph I based mine off of. It&#39;d been nine years, and I&#39;d forgotten that _I_ took that photograph. So, life moved on.</p>
<p>But YouTube was apparently desperate for me to watch this video, because they would not stop recommending it. Each time I saw the thumbnail, I&#39;d inspect that NES a little harder. I was skeptical enough to dig up my version from deviantArt and saw the similarities. <a href="https://twitter.com/dxprog/status/780199222448500736">I tweeted Ben Heck that something seemed amiss</a>. Eventually, that nugget of doubt brought forth the vague recollection: &quot;wait... didn&#39;t I take that photo?&quot;. Lucky for me, I have nearly all of my source files from school and I was able to dig that out of the Illustrator file. But just to be extra certain, I dug up the big thumbnail picture, fired up After Effects, and made this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/3o7TKuMqE7kV9siYnK.gif" alt="" title="Oh shit..."></p>
<p>That&#39;s pretty damning, but the final nail in the coffin is in the small details: the registered trademark on Nintendo is missing, and the &quot;Nintendo Entertainment System&quot; font is that shitty LED sign font. (Now that I think about it, I may have snatched that from dafont.com. I baked the paths in my Illustrator file, so I can&#39;t tell.)</p>
<p>Ben Heck and his show ripped off my work.</p>
<p>I was a little ticked, but more out of principle. This was a professionally produced show and, instead of acting like professionals and ensuring all royalties and licensing is squared away for externally sourced assets, just waltzed into Google image search and picked whatever suited their fancy without caring. Sadly, I&#39;m sure that this happens all the time. Luckily for me (and I literally just realized this), but I released that image under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">an atribution/non commercial Creative Commons license</a> (very forward thinking on my part). Long story short: you can use the image only for non-commercial purposes (Ben Heck show is very much commercial) and if you do use it, give me credit (which they did not do).</p>
<p>And you know what? If they had just <em>asked</em>, I would have gladly given permission and been beside myself that my work was seen to be good enough for use on a show that I already enjoyed. They certainly couldn&#39;t hide behind the excuse of &quot;we couldn&#39;t find the creator&quot;, because when that image shows up on Google image search, it goes to that deviantArt page or my blog. All of these have non-hidden ways of contacting me.</p>
<p>Armed with my little gif and a bit of anger, <a href="https://twitter.com/dxprog/status/780421116875550720">I passively aggressively tweeted all this at Ben Heck, his sponsor, and the production company</a>. No response. (In Rev3&#39;s defense, I think they&#39;re dead.)</p>
<p>It would probably have ended there, my small rage subsiding with the passing forgetfulness of time. However, YouTube just. Kept. Recommending. That. Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvijyBIgazE&amp;t=34s">I think Christmas Story summed up my feelings best</a> (and, no, the irony of linking to an illegal clip of a video in a post about copyright is not lost on me).</p>
<p>So, I filed a copyright report on it.</p>
<p>Next day, YouTube&#39;s copyright department emailed back asking for additional proof, which I provided in a more compact version of the above. This morning, I received this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UQiSPYf.png" alt="" title="Delicious.">
As of this writing, that video has been removed from YouTube search, Google search (surprisingly fast on that), and if you try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdzZIeemumo">visit the video itself</a>, you&#39;re greeted with this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LUgvlSS.png" alt="" title="So, so delicious"></p>
<p>My favorite part is how it says my name.</p>
<p>Morals of the story are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&#39;re working professionally in a professional industry, be professional</li>
<li>Just ask. It doesn&#39;t hurt anybody and you might just get permission.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t fuck with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>All things considered, I could still &quot;win&quot; this thing if I missed a day. But, who said this was a contest? It&#39;s more of a &quot;this is a thing we want to do, let&#39;s draw strength and encouragement from each other&quot;. Kinda like a diet buddy, but with words instead.</p>
<p>I&#39;m forced to wonder, however: what exactly am I getting out of this? Sure, for the past year or so I&#39;ve wanted to write about serious topics that weigh on my mind. But, instead of actually trying to put that stuff to words, I&#39;m bullshitting a paragraph of text. The weird thing is, as I&#39;m typing this, I know that all this rambling will come off like some disturbed and emo teenager on LiveJournal in the mid-00s.</p>
<p>I was just telling my mom this evening that I write this blog for me. So, given that, why should I care what words I lay down? I&#39;m me and I understand the context within all this is written. Of course, come next year I&#39;ll have lost that and be just another outsider looking in with only a vague recollection of the times my current self was going through. But, even given that, it&#39;s still me so why should I worry?</p>
<p>Aha!</p>
<p>Despite this notion of writing for my future self, I&#39;m fully aware of the publicness of these ramblings. Any Joe Schmoe (or people I know and know read this blog) can and will happen upon this post. If they&#39;ve made it this far, they&#39;re wondering &quot;okay... just how crazy _is_ Matt?&quot; And I&#39;m aware of all this.</p>
<p>As I continue to type.</p>
<p>Fully knowing that eyebrows will be raised. Raised in a curious pondering, perhaps a tinged with a little worry.</p>
