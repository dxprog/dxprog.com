<p>Well, here we are again. It&#39;s always such a pleasure. Remember when I did this <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done/">last year</a>? I do. Seems like it wasn&#39;t that long ago. But, time flies, as they say, and with increasing age, it does so with increased velocity, it seems. This calls for some retrospective and forward contemplation.

<h2 id="best-show-of-2011">Best Show of 2011</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - Steins;Gate</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_steins_gate.jpg" alt="" title="Steins;Gate">
Time travel stories are amazing, and this is something I&#39;ve always known.  However, Steins Gate -- a show I started watching out of idle curiosity - has confirmed how badass I think they are.  Why is that, exactly?  Sit your ass down and I&#39;ll tell you.  </p>
<p>Like all good time travel stories, the show starts out all, &quot;Huh?&quot; then proceeds to, &quot;Ah!&quot; and ends on a &quot;I FUCKING UNDERSTAND <em>EVERYTHING</em> NOW.&quot;  You know what really helps these temporal feelings along?  A refreshing cast of badass and well developed characters -- surprisingly light on school girls -- teams up with the plot to create a story so badass that you will sit down on the stoop of your Manhattan apartment and think like a <em>GODDAMN MAN</em>.</p>
<p>Convinced yet?  Not enough info for your tastes?  TOUGH SHIT.  Absorb it through every orifice and be glad you did.

<h4>Best Character</h4>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Chris - Rintarou Okabe (<em>Steins;Gate</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_okarin.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>Rintarou Okabe -- aka, mad scientist Hououin Kyouma -- is the main element that makes Steins; Gate amazing.</p>
<p>Okabe starts off over the top, telling everybody he&#39;s a mad scientist and making grand claims about a secret organization that&#39;s keeping tabs on him.  Over the course of the show, however, you see him develop into a very troubled character as the show&#39;s events begin to take their toll on him.  This depth later on really makes you feel for him as a character.</p>
<p>But you know what the best part is?  He&#39;s an ass most of the time, but in a good way, asserting himself over his supposed suboordinates in an over the top fashion.</p>
<p>Gotta love it.</p>

That is, the end of the year and the beginning of another. As has become a normal thing for my website, I am here doing reviews of anime series I watched during the year. However, I will be changing it up a bit and instead of reviewing everything, things will be done in a categorized award fashion. Joining me again this year are my brothers Jeff and Chris. So, without further ado, let&#39;s begin!</p>

<strong>Chris - First half of the first episode of We Without Wings</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I watched the first episode of this show because I wanted to see some mad panty shots.  What did I get?  An initial two minutes of fan service that made _me_ uncomfortable, followed by ten minutes of a couple of dick weeds in a bar having a boring ass conversation.</p>
<p>I will never get those twelve minutes of my life back.

All of a sudden, the song I&#39;m listening to cuts out and I hear <a href="http://dxmp.s3.amazonaws.com/songs/futurepoop.mp3">this</a>. Unfortunately, due to the design of my music listening system, my living room stereo is controllable from anywhere, hence this was made possible.</p>
<p>But, I have also written things so that I can control the playlist of any person currently using the page. So, I fired the following back at my brother:</p>

<p>Best $0.99 I&#39;ve ever spent on a karaoke song.</p>
