Here&#39;s a bunch of pictures and little write up because... well, there&#39;s not really a story here and sadly no swan boats.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - A Little Tipsy</h2><time>June 25, 2013</time><div><p>Contrary to yesterday&#39;s post, I should embrace the accountability report because it&#39;s stupid simple to write. A handful of subjects and some words on how I failed to meet them. Works well today when I&#39;m buzzing a bit and just need to get a post out.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I actually did very well last week, biking to work four out of five days and keeping away from the sweets. I stumbled a bit on Friday where I had a heart stopping burger and didn&#39;t bike, but it could have been worse. The weekend was fairly low key calorie wise as well. Compare that to today where I had four beers while conversing with a certain USB input virtual accessor and killing digital robots and then following it up with Taco Bell. Not great to be sure. Also, it&#39;s been rainy, so I haven&#39;t biked. Tomorrow I plan on changing that.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I&#39;m still running through the list of stuff I need to get for living in my new quarters. This weekend, I acquired myself a new bed, one of much higher quality than I&#39;m used to having; certainly one that cost more money than I would&#39;ve otherwise been comfortable in parting with. Additionally, a small trip to Japantown drained a few dollars, but not too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Ain&#39;t done squat, and this is unacceptable. Though, I do often listen to some of the audio lessons when they pop up on random during bike rides... this isn&#39;t actually helping me, though. It does sometimes re-enforce the little Japanese I do know, I guess.</p>
