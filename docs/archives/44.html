This weekend, as I was visiting my folks, we held another one. Same premise: each person chooses a picture, all three must draw said picture to the best of their ability. All laying around my iPad, the battle began.</p>
<p>[gallery=Joe&#39;s Pick - Wind Waker Link]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_link.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_link.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_link.jpg" alt="" title="Link">Steve&#39;s Version[/img]
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_link.jpg" alt="" title="Link">My Version[/img][/gallery]
I would&#39;ve figured Joe would have this in the bag as he draws Wind Waker Link A LOT and without reference, even. But, such was not to be. As can be seen, I got a little bored waiting for everybody to finish.</p>
<p>[gallery=Steve&#39;s Pick - L from Death Note]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_l.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_l.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_l.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_l.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Now, I will go on record and say I didn&#39;t like the chosen picture much, but there it is. I&#39;d actually call this a three way tie because we all hit and miss aspects of the picture (there&#39;s something going on with the eyes on mine).</p>
<p>[gallery=Matt&#39;s Pick - Haqua from World God Only Knows]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Joe decided to sit this one out for whatever reason pretty much leaving me the winner by default. Both Steve and I quit prematurely because we were getting bored with the whole thing. I&#39;m just happy mine doesn&#39;t look &quot;lumpy&quot; and even Chris agreed.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Our second art battle with me, yet again, taking away the trophy. I think next time we should try not copying a source image and just toss out a subject to draw. It could very well level the playing field. All in good fun, though.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>From the Con Floor - Days 2 &amp; 3</h2><time>July 17, 2011</time><div><p>So, Tokyo in Tulsa has come to a close for the year, ending the fourth convention I&#39;ve been to and the first where I&#39;ve actually cosplayed at. Yes, I&#39;ve teased you all long enough. Feast your eyes on the 100% sexiness below:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_matt.jpg" alt="" title="DE GESO!"></p>
<p>It&#39;s a male variant of <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XED8rrt6EgU/TfS0zX1EqsI/AAAAAAAAAlI/XAmi15NjBOQ/s1600/0008-Shinryaku-Ika-Musume-Squid-Girl.jpg">Squid Girl</a>, and I&#39;ll take over this squidding planet!</p>
<p>Check out the rest of the pics after the break (there&#39;s a lot, 56k warning).[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_avatar.jpg" alt="" title="Not that James Cameron bullshit">
Tai Ling and Azula from Avatar (the Airbending variety). They were part of a larger group, though where those other guys were when I took this picture, I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_chris.jpg" alt="" title="ME GUSTA!">
This was Chris&#39; last minute cosplay, printed on my printer while I was at work, affixed to a piece of cardboard with flour/water paste and finally attached to his sunglasses. He got stopped for pictures more than anybody else. And free hugs. How I hate him &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_me_gusta.jpg" alt="" title="Mmm... yuri....">
Appropriate, methinks.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_dn.jpg" alt="" title="I AM JUSTICE">
A pretty good Death Note group consisting of L, Misa Amane and Light Yagami (from left to right). Though, I think this L is a girl...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_higurashi.jpg" alt="" title="Gomen na sai!">
Satoka Hojou and Rika Furude from Higurashi. Seeing these two was a bit of a surprise (but a welcome one).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_kitty.jpg" alt="" title="The Whore of Sanrio">
I myself don&#39;t care for Hello Kitty, but I thought my sisters would enjoy it. Not to mention, watching this person awkwardly walk through the crowded vendor room was a bit amusing.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_medic.jpg" alt="" title="MEDIC!">
The medic from TF2. I don&#39;t think this person has a license to practice medicine.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_tf2.jpg" alt="" title="Burn, baby burn!">
Pyro and Demo man, also from TF2. btw, I should say: Two Fort is the greatest map of all time. OF ALL TIME!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_naruto.jpg" alt="" title="A-ano?">
Hinata Hyuuga and and Gaara of Naruto fame. There were plenty of Naruto cosplayers, most not as good as the ones I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8rHf70GFg">saw at Jacon</a>, but these were okay enough to warrant a picture. And that Gaara&#39;s actually a guy. Good for him.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_pokemans.jpg" alt="" title="Gotta catch &#39;em... ugh, so 1999">
Three various Pokemon trainers. The right one is Ash (I think) and I know the middle one is the new girl option, but I don&#39;t know much Pokemans anything. I do know, though, that when they return to their respective pokeballs, there&#39;s enough energy create to fuse oxygen and ignite the atmosphere. Cooool.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_sakura.jpg" alt="" title="Hadouken?">
Sakura from Street Fighter. Honestly, don&#39;t know much SF either, but she is wearing a school girl outfit. HAHA! I&#39;m not creepy &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_snake.jpg" alt="" title="SNAAAAAAAKE">
Solid Snake... again. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen at least one Snake at every con I&#39;ve been to.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_stormy.jpg" alt="" title="TK-1138">
I don&#39;t need to explain this one, though I will say the whole suit was damned amazing, right down to the vocoder in his helmet.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_wolfwood.jpg" alt="" title="That ain&#39;t no Jesus cross, ladies and gentleman.">
Wolfwood from Trigun. Poor guy was trying to fix his &quot;cross&quot; when I bugged him for a picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_yoko.jpg" alt="" title="PIERCE THE HEAVENS">
I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: I want a Yoko &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_zelda.jpg" alt="" title="What can I say here? These guys don&#39;t talk...">
A much better Zelda cosplay. So good, in fact, that the girl dressed as Zelda got second place in the cosplay contest.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_fett.jpg" alt="" title="No disintegrations">
A black garbed Boba Fett? Regardless, still a bitchin&#39; costume.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_hammer.jpg" alt="" title="The hamme is his penis">
Captain Hammer from Dr. Horrible&#39;s Sing-a-long Blog. Something I would not have expected.</p>
<p>So, those are all the pictures I have for all you fine people (19 photos should be more than enough to satiate you). I may write some thoughts on the panels and con itself later this week. Till then... DE GESO!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>From the Con Floor - Day 1</h2><time>July 15, 2011</time><div><p>Today was the first of our three day long anime convention that is Tokyo in Tulsa. Before you ask, I did not cosplay today. That will be for tomorrow, the largest and busiest day of the con. So far, this year has far and away kicked the pants off of TnT last year. The panels have been better so far (thank you, Todd Haberkorn; you are truly hilarious) and the fact that they acquired the convention center over the cramped hotel has made it much nicer, though it&#39;s still cramped. Good times were had and I hope tomorrow will go even better.</p>
<p>But, you want pictures. So pictures you will have. Hit them after the break.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_rebel.jpg" alt="" title="Where are your Rebel friends now?"></p>
<p>First guy to get his photo snapped was a Rebel trooper, one of those men who carelessly tossed themselves in front of Imperial fire on the Tantive IV. First time I&#39;ve seen one of these guys at a con.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_l.jpg" alt="" title="Nobody knows for sure what his name is..."></p>
<p>L, Ryuzaki or Hideki Ryuga from Death Note. Yes, it&#39;s considered the cop-out of all cosplay, but at least I can appreciate the series now.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_weegee.jpg" alt="" title="Weegee!"></p>
<p>What is with this man&#39;s grimacing look? Perhaps it&#39;s because he has spent too long living in the shadow of his shorter, fatter brother. That 1-up ain&#39;t gonna help you here, son.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_link.jpg" alt="" title="..."></p>
<p>It&#39;s Link as portrayed by a girl... not too uncommon, actually. Relatedly, they were selling that shield (though better made) for $60 at the vendor room.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_bazaar.jpg" alt="" title="Lotta stuff, a yup"></p>
<p>An overhead shot of the artist alley. This is probably about half as crowded as it was immediately after the opening ceremonies.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_artiste.jpg" alt="" title="Not bad, brah"></p>
<p>Some dude drawing in a quieter area of the building, and doing so pretty well at that.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_peach_alice.jpg" alt="" title="Maarriooooo"></p>
<p>Princess Peach and I assume Alice of Wonderland fame. An odd combo, but hey. Why not?</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_mudkip.jpg" alt="" title="So..."></p>
<p>This one is for my brother Steve. If you&#39;re aware of the meme, nothing more need be said.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s the report from day one. I&#39;m going to save any longer/deeper impressions I have for after the whole thing is wrapped up, but I like how things have started so far.</p>
<p>And I must hear more of Todd Haberkorn. He was pretty damned hilarious.</p>
