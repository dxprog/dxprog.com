Hey, you! Throwing objects into the lake is against
park rules!

Yeah, so what are you going to do about it?

Hey! I thought you couldn&#39;t throw things into the lake

RANGER BOB
I didn&#39;t throw you, I pushed you

Some people are eating when Ranger Bob approaches</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
I&#39;m sorry, but the park calorie limit is 500. Eating that
will exceed the limit. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to take it.

This campfire is illegal.

No it ain&#39;t! We&#39;re not over the border.

<p>On Boat Day(TM), aka the day where I was drunk for ~14 hours straight, the finale of the evening was at some shady looking Mexican restaurant in a part of San Francisco I was unfamiliar with. Not that I would&#39;ve known where I was anyways, I had just had something called an &quot;Aviator&quot; (it was alright, iirc). But while I was there, I had quite possibly the most delicious hunk of Americanized Mexican food of all time. Today - utilizing all my available means of free transportation - I sought that place back out, a certain <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?authuser=0#!q=El+Farlito+Bar&amp;amp;amp;amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d5512!2d-122.4179414!3d37.7523817!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x808f7e474d4864e5%3A0xd8b448aadf21925!3m8!1m3!1d5546!2d-121.8337824!3d37.2942532!3m2!1i2560!2i1342!4f13.1!4m2!3d37.752696!4d-122.418371">El Farolito</a>, to see if it was just the drunkenness or if it really was that good. I took the scenic route getting there, so begins my visual tale.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s6ZJfZ7h.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up this hill with railway tie stairs"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aftp40Mh.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up several 45 degree streets until I got to the top with a very impressive view of the city"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NeSQlALh.jpg" alt="" title="Saw this on the way. Not sure what&#39;s going on..."></p>
<p>And so, after much trekking and a lot of cursing the people who built their city on a fucking cliff, I arrived at the promised land. And let me tell you, that burrito was just as awesome as I was hoping it&#39;d be. And super cheap too, only ~$7 for the burrito and a Sprite.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o6vcqwS.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s only 5000 calories"></p>
<p>I debated at this point whether I should literally walk the ten steps down to BART for my return trip or walk back home and attempt to exercise off the guilt. I chose the latter and I&#39;m kind of glad I did. I didn&#39;t realize it on the initial part of the trip, but I&#39;d had my back to the bay the entire time. So as I summited the last hill, I was greeted with a rather picturesque sight.</p>

<p>San Francisco is run down, shit covered, piss scented, creepy bitch of a city, but if you find the right spots, it can be downright beautiful. Still...</p>
