I didn&#39;t think I could do it, but it turned out to be not so difficult. Yay me! Now that that&#39;s out of the way, let me weave you a tale.</p>
<p>Four days a week, I eat Hot Pockets(R) for lunch (the fifth is usually Subway). I have a very specific routine:</p>
<p>1) Walk to break room
2) Grab Hot Pocket(R) and set microwave for 2 minutes
3) Leave break room and take a leak
4) Return to break room and retrieve Hot Pocket(R)</p>
<p>Mundane, yes? Nothing special happening here, right? That&#39;s where you&#39;d be wrong. By the time I return to the break room from the the bathroom, the microwave will read, WITHOUT FAIL, between 18 and 22 seconds left.</p>
<p>This routine, with all the variables (how fast I walk, how much I need to piss, people I might bump into along the way, etc), takes 1 minute and 40 seconds with an error rate of -2/+2 seconds. That&#39;s pretty damn good if you ask me.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Art Battle Redux!</h2><time>July 23, 2011</time><div><p>A few months back, my two youngest bros and myself had a little <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/art-battle-fighting-small-children-for-my-ego/">art battle</a> which I summarily won quite handily. This weekend, as I was visiting my folks, we held another one. Same premise: each person chooses a picture, all three must draw said picture to the best of their ability. All laying around my iPad, the battle began.</p>

I would&#39;ve figured Joe would have this in the bag as he draws Wind Waker Link A LOT and without reference, even. But, such was not to be. As can be seen, I got a little bored waiting for everybody to finish.</p>
<p>[gallery=Steve&#39;s Pick - L from Death Note]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_l.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_l.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_l.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_l.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Now, I will go on record and say I didn&#39;t like the chosen picture much, but there it is. I&#39;d actually call this a three way tie because we all hit and miss aspects of the picture (there&#39;s something going on with the eyes on mine).</p>
<p>[gallery=Matt&#39;s Pick - Haqua from World God Only Knows]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Joe decided to sit this one out for whatever reason pretty much leaving me the winner by default. Both Steve and I quit prematurely because we were getting bored with the whole thing. I&#39;m just happy mine doesn&#39;t look &quot;lumpy&quot; and even Chris agreed.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Our second art battle with me, yet again, taking away the trophy. I think next time we should try not copying a source image and just toss out a subject to draw. It could very well level the playing field. All in good fun, though.</p>
