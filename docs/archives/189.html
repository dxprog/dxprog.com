I&#39;m not even necessarily all that busy, just no real drive to write anything on this blog. However, there is something I need to bring to light and here it is:</p>

<p>Maybe some more on me later after I&#39;m done with finals and stuff this week.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Apple keeps getting me...</h2><time>September 29, 2007</time><div><p>I do not consider myself an Apple zealot, but I&#39;ll have to admit that they make very nice hardware. I&#39;m completely loving my Mac Book Pro. It&#39;s doubley more awesome that my Mac mini in almost every respect. Clock speed, RAM, hard drive space, video, you name it this thing is better. And it&#39;s portable. And it gets blazing hot when it&#39;s doing heavy processing, hotter than the surface of the sun I&#39;d say.</p>
<p>Yesterday I picked up my books and softwares, those being Final Cut Studio 2 and Adobe Creative Suite 3 (adds up to a grand total of $3000+). I loaded up CS3 immediately and had fun doing stupid Photoshop jobs all day.</p>

<p>I tried screwing around with FCS2 last night but didn&#39;t really get anywhere. Final Cut Pro itself seems fairly straight forward so far but I couldn&#39;t figure out Color (color grading app) which is a bummer because one thing that my videos need are to be color graded.</p>
<p>School doesn&#39;t start until Tuesday and I&#39;m beginning to get a little bored. E and I have been playing Halo 2 and we watched all the Back to te Future movies, but I&#39;m ready for school. I do have my copy of Eternal Sonata now so maybe that&#39;ll ease the pai of waiting even if just by a little bit. I could always draw, I suppose. But I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to top this:</p>
