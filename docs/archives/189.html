In the mean time I am recovering from a... ahem... computer problem. I shall just say this: don't go around deleting things unless you are absolutely, one hundred precent sure they don't have some sort of low-level hook into your system. And on top of that don't go stopping services unless you are completely certain you aren't going to need it. So, yeah.

I'll probably put something up on Tuesday.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/digital-double-the-nativity-crystal-chronicles-edition">Digital Double - &quot;The Nativity, Crystal Chronicles Edition&quot;</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 29, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content">[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/66183/)

But that's about all I have to say about that.</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/dxprog.github.io/docs/entry/digital-double-the-nativity-crystal-chronicles-edition">Digital Double - &quot;The Nativity, Crystal Chronicles Edition&quot;</a></h1><time class="post__published">September 29, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/66183/">Comic</a></p>
