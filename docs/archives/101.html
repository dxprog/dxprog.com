<p>Another comic, yay! Anybody who has ever played multiplayer FSA will know exactly where I&#39;m coming from... force gem hogs!</p>

You can start <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/?p=67">here</a>. And now the highlights of the last year:</p>
<ul>

<li>I applied for a job (<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/the-canon-to-real-life/">twice</a>, actually) and was <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/my-first-day/">hired</a></li>
<li>I got a <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/laptop-whoooo/">laptop</a></li>

<li>I bought an <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21128349&amp;postID=114145540870772689">iPod</a></li>
<li>I <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21128349&amp;postID=114184015940905673">bowled</a> a hell of a season</li>

<li>Got my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/well-the-video-says-all-basically/">driver&#39;s license</a></li>
<li>I&#39;ve fallen for a girl and been <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/f5-pictures-speak-louder-than-words/">heart broken</a> (going for two times now, on the same girl even)</li>
<li>I&#39;ve become a <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/ddr-mania/">DDR addict</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, that&#39;s quite a year. I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m far more mature now than I was this time last year, at least I&#39;m a tad wiser. Well, it&#39;s 4:30am and I really should be in bed. See ya</p>

<p>It&#39;s been over three weeks since I&#39;ve posted a comic so I decided to drag the wacom downstairs and make it on the parents&#39; computer. Speaking of which, there was no pencil work for this one. It was all sketched out digtally. That tablet rocks!</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/new-design-coming">New Design Coming!</a></h2><time>July 7, 2006</time><div><p>A while back I worked up a new design for the site and I&#39;ve been working on getting it finished the last few days. Comment posting still doesn&#39;t work and the &quot;My Digg&quot; bar is broken, but I think this is probably one of the best designs I&#39;ve had in a while. But don&#39;t take my word for it, <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/new_design.png">see for yourselves.</a> The comic page is also done in this style, though it&#39;s not quite working yet.</p>
</div></article><article><h2><a href="http://staticr.dxprog.com/entry/sketches-oh-joy">Sketches, oh joy</a></h2><time>July 4, 2006</time><div><p>No laptop and as such I am forced to put up more random selections of my artwork.</p>

This is actually some concept art for an upcoming comic. I&#39;m trying to work more emotion into the characters&#39; body language.</p>

Originally started out as just some kid, but give him the right hair and you have First-grader Gabe!</p>

A bust of Captain Haddock from the Adventures of Tintin comics.</p>

Captain Jack is back!</p>

A quick sketch of my hand. An <a href="http://www.cubetoons.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=1">exercise</a> prescribed by JKR.</p>
<p>Well, there you are. One semi-interesting thing to note is that Captain Haddock is the only drawing here done with a no. 2 pencil. Everything else was done using my wonderful 0.7 Pentel mechanical pencil. Oh, it is a thing of beauty :-)</p>
