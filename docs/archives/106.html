So, given the spirit of the season, I shell delve into Christmas related subject. Today, I will be violently tearing apart a Christmas song (no, not the Nat King Cole one).</p>
<p>On the whole, I enjoy Christmas music. Arguably, I don&#39;t quite as much now as I did in my younger years, but it still is an important part of the season. There are, however, some songs I cannot stand. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a_Y1wAJ2MU">Christmas Shoes</a> ranks pretty high on that list, for example. And, of course, let us not forget songs about  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTNheCEUP_A#t=15s">attempted Christmas date rape</a>. Not to mention that song that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33o32C0ogVM">ISN&#39;T EVEN A FUCKING CHRISTMAS SONG!!!</a></p>
<p>Sorry, that one always hits a nerve.</p>
<p>Today, however, I will discuss <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWVU7ZbbVps">Do You Hear What I Hear?</a>. Aside from being incredibly repetitive and musically <em>blah</em>, the lyrics (when over-analysed) make about as much sense as mayonnaise taking a brisk vacation on the shores of Hawaii. So, let&#39;s begin![break]</p>
<p><strong>Said the night wind to the little lamb</strong>
Because air particles can talk and animals comprehend their mutterings. I&#39;ll let this one slide because I watch shows where <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/midori-kasugano/">humans</a> can replace <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">other humans extremities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A star passing in the night with a tail as big as a kite</strong>
Multiple things going wrong here. Firstly, stars don&#39;t have tails. Those are comets (I will also allow meteors). Secondly, should that be &quot;a tail as big as a kite&#39;s&quot; comparing the tails of both objects, or are we actually comparing the tail of the &quot;star&quot; to the body of the kite? Because kites are not that large and I am left unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy</strong>
Why the hell not? The lamb is already getting its daily news from the wind...</p>
<p><strong>With a voice as big as the sea</strong>
Another sad comparison here. You can&#39;t compare physical size with perceived volume. They are on two totally different scales. I was actually going to try and figure out what this would equate to in decibels given the size of some sea, but quit when I realized the answer would regardless blow out your eardrums. You can amazingly fix this lyric by changing out the word &quot;big&quot; for &quot;loud&quot;. Not only does it still fit the rhythm of the song, but now it makes sense!</p>
<p><strong>A child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold</strong>
You know... I can (almost) appreciate the thought here. But, how about bringing a more immediately solution... like maybe a goddamn blanket. We&#39;ve established that poor baby Jesus is freezing his buns off so, obviously, the solution is to bring him cold metal. It&#39;d be a shame if he were to <strong>die</strong> of hypothermia before he can enjoy those precious metals. Luckily, he&#39;s Jesus and will forgive your stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>The king&#39;s declaration to the &quot;people everywhere&quot;</strong>
In a nutshell, this lyric has the kind from the previous stanza declaring to his subjects that Jesus is going to save the world.</p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s think about this for a second. Wasn&#39;t Herod king at this point? Wasn&#39;t his first act upon hearing about Jesus to [b]<em>slaughter</em>[/b] all male children up to the age of two? Isn&#39;t turning this blind eye towards history the same thing as the holocaust deniers? And yet this song is not only accepted, but no doubt sang in buildings of worship. Amazing.</p>
<p>Before you get all pissed off writing a nasty comment about how I &quot;don&#39;t get it,&quot; I do understand the intention of the song. I&#39;m just a snarky asshole and that&#39;s how I roll.</p>
<p>Later, bitches :D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My Ideal First Date</h2><time>November 19, 2011</time><div><p>So, I was talking with an a college buddy of mine and he&#39;s all trying to get me to join the dating site &quot;Plenty Of Fish&quot;. I went along with it for kicks and giggles, mostly just porting over info from my OkCupid profile (which I also maintain primarily for kicks and giggles). However, one question on there set my writing mind ablaze: &quot;First date?&quot;. Now, this field was optional, but I really wanted to paint a picture for this one. Below is what I wrote:</p>
<p>[quote]A first formal date, in an ideal scenario, would pan out as such:</p>
<p>The time is 6:30. The sun is beginning to set, casting a crimson hue over the city. I gaze in the mirror to ensure everything is in order before heading down the stairs and entering my car. It&#39;s still thirty minutes early, but all has been calculated to arrive at her doorstep five minutes early given the distance and traffic for this time of day.</p>
<p>I arrive at the dwelling of my lady friend at 6:54pm, ever so slightly ahead of schedule. I take a deep breath, willing away my nervousness, step out of the car, and walk up to the door announcing my arrival by knock or door bell (if one is available). Lady friend opens the door and I comment her on how lovely she looks. We walk over to my chariot and I open the door for her, because I swing that way (pun intended).</p>
<p>Our first stop of the evening is to a mildly formal, sit down restaurant. We&#39;re not talking Chateau Le Blanc, but Fridays, Olive Garden, something in that vein. We make lighthearted conversation over the next hour and a half or so. We don&#39;t want to dawdle too long, because the movie begins at 9:15pm. I pick up the tab and we make our exit.</p>
<p>The choice of movie for the evening has been left entirely up to the lady friend. I do this because I&#39;m shooting for date number two (when I get to pick the movie/activity). As we sit there in the dark, eyes taking in the sea of colors projected before us, I might just make a move to hold her hand. No putting my arms around her or anything. This is left for stage two. The movie over, we exit the theater and once again make our way to my ride (with all it&#39;s lack of &quot;pimpin&#39;&quot;) and, as I&#39;ve done all night, I open the door for her. Chivalry isn&#39;t dead, ladies.</p>
<p>I return her to her place of dwelling and I see her to the door. I put out a couple of verbal probes to see how the evening fared. Second date and a continuation of seeing each other is my only goal, though a small peck on the cheek is most certainly welcome (nothing full on, this only the first date, people!).</p>
<p>I return to my house and reflect upon the evening. Once I&#39;m bored of that, I fire up some porn and masturbate furiously for the rest of the night. The end![/quote]</p>
<p>I can see the throng of ladies making their way for my door already...</p>
