<p>A littel late, but there you have it. You definitely have to have been listening to diggnation the last few weeks to get this one.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s time for Name.. that.. Star!!</h2><time>May 16, 2006</time><div><p>While digging through the site of an unamed famous celebrity, I found this interesting picture:</p>

<p>So, can you figure out who it is? Here&#39;s a little hint:</p>

<p>Whoever correctly guesses the person gets a shout out in the next podcast (coming this Thursday, it&#39;ll be good. Trust me).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>BEST... COMIC... EVAR!</h2><time>May 14, 2006</time><div><p>I&#39;m not sure how many of you (all three of ya) saunter over to <a href="http://www.revo-news.frih.net/">my bro&#39;s site</a>, but if you don&#39;t you&#39;re really missing out because it is home to one of the best web comics on the net (and I&#39;m not just saying that to be nice). <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060515/">Today&#39;s comic</a> is what made me say &quot;Hey! I need to share this with people!&quot;. So go check it out, keep checking it out, it&#39;s all good.</p>
<p>As for my own comic don&#39;t expect the next one till Tuesday. I don&#39;t even have the thing scribbled out on paper yet let alone coloered and all that malarkey :-P.</p>

<p>Note - I was originally going to call Kevin a mustard in that last frame (only not quite as nice), however, I thought it would be more in character for him to swear.</p>
<p>Note 2 - Oh, and since I don&#39;t know what the heck Keith looks like, I decided to have Gabe from <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> make a cameo appearance. I may do things like that from time to time. &#39;Tis fun ;-)</p>

<p>Warning: For this series of strips you really need to be a <a href="http://www.diggnation.com/">diggnation</a> listener to get the jokes.</p>
