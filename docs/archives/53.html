<p>If you were unfortunate enough to have sat through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-top-5-list/">top 5 anime video</a>, you&#39;ll know that Clannad was pretty high up there on the list (number one, to be exact). To this day, I still consider it my favorite anime so when I wandered past a &quot;Clannad - Motion Picture&quot; DVD at Hastings, I had to rent it even though I knew it was going to be terrible.</p>
<p>I had no idea just how bad it was going to be. Ah, where to begin?

I&#39;m currently suffering from what I can best describe as culture shock. A good many things are polar opposite from how they were at Griffin. There&#39;s no phones ringing all the time, no boss interrupting every ten minutes and also it is very, very quiet. Like, I haven&#39;t really spoken to anybody all week and it seems (from where I sit) that there are no other impromptu coworker conversations breaking out. That part I kind of miss, but the quiet certainly does lend well to productivity.</p>
<p>I cannot say, however, that I still don&#39;t find the calm a little unnerving. Seeing how I&#39;ve lived in a house with a lot of people for nearly my entire life, I&#39;ve grown accustomed to the noise that comes with it. So much so, it seems, that whereas most people would notice the abundance of noise, I am keenly aware of its absence. But it&#39;s something I&#39;d best get used to because I&#39;ll be endeavoring out on my own in just a couple of short months.</p>
<p>Yes, my own place. Something I&#39;ve daydreamed about for quite some time (and still am doing as the time draws near). Thinking about how I&#39;ll arrange things, what kind of furniture and wall adornments I&#39;d like, extra-house activities I can take part in, etc. It&#39;s certainly an exciting time, but also one that carries a bit of somber weight. Certainly, I&#39;ve done this &quot;moving away from home&quot; thing before, but last time came with a fair certainty that I would be returning for some time. This time is it. The true closing of this chapter of my life and the opening of a new one with all the experiences that will come with. Like hitting the dating scene. That will certainly bring both some interesting, awesome and probably incredibly awkward moments.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different.</p>
<p>As you may or may not be aware (which would be sad if you weren&#39;t), Japan got hit by a big ol&#39; quake yesterday. Now, usually I don&#39;t really &quot;feel&quot; much when these natural disasters strike. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m cold and heartless (or maybe I am), but things Katrina, Sri Lanka  or Haiti really only elicited an &quot;oh, well that kinda sucks&quot; feeling from me. I believe this probably stems from the fact that I have no real connection to any of these places or people (Louisiana even). But, through all the games, manga and anime I&#39;ve consumed over the last few years, I&#39;ve developed a deep respect for Japan, its people and its culture and I think that is why this disaster has touched me more than the others. That all said, my thoughts will be with these fine people as they pull themselves back together. I&#39;ve no qualm in my mind that they will do so admirably.</p>

I will be moving on to bigger and better things at Winnercomm, doing web work for the Outdoor Channel it seems. At least it comes with a significant raise and the title of &quot;web developer.&quot;</p>
<p>To commemorate the event, I thought I&#39;d do a small photo montage to my old job as captured by my iPhone&#39;s camera.

As I was walking, I noticed somebody washing the outside windows of a building. I immediately heard an oft used phrase of my parents: &quot;Keep your face/hands off the glass, somebody has to come along and clean those.&quot; That&#39;s when it hit me: this adage doesn&#39;t really hold any water. Why?</p>
<p>Those windows are going to be washed regardless of child prints on them. The dirt and grime that accumulate from dust or the elements far outweighs in terms of amount and regularity anything my greasy kid hands could leave behind. And even if these were not a factor, these panes would be cleaned anyways just because of general routine.</p>
<p>Nice try, parental units.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have some shop windows to lick.</p>

<p>In what was a certainly very odd week, I was finally able to return the the Hackmann homestead Friday afternoon. I&#39;ve not really explained exactly what happened during this hellish week, so I will take the time to do so now.</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> - The morning was spent shuffling my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/round-2-my-morning-in-pictures">shattered car</a> in for repairs and commencing some work from home. It was repaired by ~11:30 and I figured, hey, I can make it down to work before my lunch hour is up and get some real work done before I&#39;m snowed in for the week. However, the powers that be saw fit to keep me stranded in a hotel in downtown. Home was not forthcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> - This is where the days begin to blur together. I had to report for duty at 6am just in case something went wrong (it didn&#39;t). What followed was a long, slow twelve hours of work. Returning to the hotel I learned that the wifi wasn&#39;t working. Stuck without interwebs, I decided to head down the the bar for alcohol and food (found some scraps of internet down there, too). One $34 meal down.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> - Much the same as Tuesday. 6am, ~12 hours and no internet to greet me when I returned. I decided to skip the bar in lieu of some <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/snowpocalypse-2011-coffee-noodles">instant noodles</a> and a little &quot;film making&quot; to keep me company. Also interesting, the fire alarm went off during my evening nap. In a half awake stupor, I grabbed my effects (phone, wallet, keys) and ran out of the room without shoes or my room card, down 14 flights of stairs and into a huge as snow drift. I proceeded to make my way around the exterior of the hotel (in the snow, in my bare feed) to the entrance to inquire as to what was going on. Short answer: nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong> - Thursday was a more normal day, appearing to work at the usual 8:30am. Some other coworkers were able to make it in that day as well, so it wasn&#39;t quite as boring. Returned to the hotel where I found the internet had returned. I returned to the hotel bar again that night, again for food and alcohol. I also mingled with completed strangers for some time (one of which was female).</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> - Friday was a short day. The powers let me leave at 11:30am so I could begin my perilous journey back to the homestead. It took a little more than twice as long as usual and almost getting stuck in a snow drift at QuickTrip, but I made it.</p>
<p>So, we&#39;re now at Sunday. I have to return tomorrow plus there&#39;s the possibility of more snow this week. It&#39;d be an understatement to say that I am not looking forward to returning.</p>
