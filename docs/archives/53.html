Fun fact: the fat kid in the commercial - my brother Chris - is very not fat now.</p>

Using a sewing machine kindly borrowed from my sisters, I laid down the first stitches to that end today.</p>
<p>I spent the first thirty minutes battling the contraption before I decided to just google the damn thing. I eventually stumbled upon some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEvMTv2xVg">scrap book sewing how to video</a> that happened to be using mostly the same model of machine I had (same machine, different paint job).</p>

<p>After watching all twentyish minutes of tutorial, I was finally up and running and created a successful debug output piece.</p>

<p>With all the pre-work out of the way, I got started on one of the pieces. It turned out pretty shitty and I&#39;ve got nine more to go...</p>

As such, I have made use of it quite a bit in my one month of living here. I thought, perhaps, I could give some quick thoughts on the movies I have watched there.</p>
<h2 id="thor">Thor</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_thor.jpg" alt="" title="Thor">
I know pretty much nothing about the Marvel universe (outside of what I&#39;ve seen in movies), so I went into Thor with no idea of what to expect. It has a much different tone than previous Marvel movies, a feeling I attribute to the source material being more based on Norse mythos as opposed to straight up sci-fi. It was an enjoyable film, but not near as awesome as the first Iron Man. - 7/10

So good to be back at my computer with a real keyboard and a copy of Photoshop with which to make stupid blog headers.</p>
<p>So, in my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/ipadly-thing">previous post</a>, I mentioned a particular game called SeaGlass. It is, or at least attempts to be, a Tetris Attack type clone. It&#39;s obvious that there was no love or effort put into this game and, being my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/welcome_to_the_week_of_top_5/">favorite game of all time</a>, it makes me sad inside.</p>
<p>I simply cannot stand for this.</p>
<p>So, as I am already in a heated battle with my much maligned <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/linkman2004">younger brother</a> developing just such a game, I will scrap the XNA codebase I&#39;ve spent some evenings working on and move over to the iOS platform for development. Using the <a href="http://www.airplaysdk.com/">Airplay SDK</a>, I will create a game for the App Store that is a truly worthy entry to the game series it plays homage to.</p>
<p>That and I can charge 99 cents and make a tiny profit. Really, this is me testing the mobile development world with an application I am already <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/">quite familiar with</a>. I&#39;ve been wanting to break into the arena for some time and this is where it begins.</p>
