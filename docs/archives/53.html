<p>Yes, those are <em>ahem</em> protrusions in an aptly placed spot. They&#39;re made of the same material you&#39;d find in a keyboard/mouse wrist rest (yes, I touched it). My brother was quite taken by the material (he claims just the material).</p>
<p>Writing up enormously long posts is quite cumbersome on this laptop and are also so schizophrenic that it detracts from the awesomeness of individual locations visited. Thus, I will be penning shorter yet more informational articles when we return to the states, sometime &quot;tomorrow&quot; (or the day after tomorrow in American time). Look forward to it!</p>

We&#39;re heading out early for more sightseeing, I&#39;ve slept in late (6:45 am), so all you get today is a video of Chris and I bashing out some Taiko goodness at the SEGA arcade in Akihabara (who gracefully didn&#39;t have any photography bans that I could see). Ja ne~!</p>
