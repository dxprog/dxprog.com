<p>E3. For gamers, it&#39;s like a second Christmas. People are giddy with anticipation and large corporations are out to get your money. And the only gift we actually receive is information. It truly is a magical time of year.</p>
<p>It&#39;s getting a tad late for Sony and Microsoft (though I was pretty damn close with Gears 3 and Kinect shit, little else), but I wanted to toss my predictions for this year&#39;s Nintendo conference up to be mocked and ridiculed by the passage of time.</p>
<p><strong>1. Zelda: Skyward Sword</strong>
This is the easy one. We&#39;ll see more video, maybe get some more insight into the story and get a release date. There may be a surprise or two as to what console it comes out for, though. My guess is we&#39;ll have another Twilight Princess scenario (i.e. current and next console simul-release).</p>
<p><strong>2. 3DS</strong>
Of course, the newly released Nintendo 3DS will get a fair amount of time in the press release. We&#39;ll get some more info on the Kid Icarus game, the Mario game that&#39;s been teased, third party titles and and I&#39;m guessing either a Zelda game (that&#39;s not OOT) or, going out on a limb, Smash Bros for 3DS.</p>
<p><strong>3. The New Console</strong>
Of course, this will be the show stealer. But, in Nintendo fashion, little will actually be said this time &#39;round (look for more info at TGS). Will it be faster and close to on par with the 360/PS3? Yeah, but they won&#39;t give us hard facts. Will there be a fancy, 6&quot; touch screen controller? I&#39;m calling bullshit on that one. Firstly, it directly competes with their existing handheld line. Secondly, the unit would become far too expensive (imagine buying four iPhones at full retail price). There will be a gimmick in there somewhere, but I can&#39;t see this one coming to fruition. We&#39;ll also be teased some visuals of games we&#39;ll never actually see, but I don&#39;t expect just a lot of details on <em>Project Cafe</em>.</p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s my predictions. Nothing earth shattering, sure, but there they are. What we find out about the new console may make or break my future in gaming. We&#39;ll see what happens tomorrow.</p>

The ordeal went down like this:</p>
<p><em>walks over to iPad table in Apple store like a boss</em></p>
<p>Apple dude: Hi! Can I help you?</p>
<p>Me: 16GB wifi iPads. Have any?</p>
<p>Apple chick: I have one. Black.</p>
<p>Me: It&#39;s mine!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s verbatim how it went down.</p>
<p>I am enjoying this thing, as I thought I would. My eyes particularly enjoy the very large screen. Been checking out the apps available and sighing over the apps I have that aren&#39;t iPad formatted (lookin&#39; at you, Skype).</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve been looking for options for iOS development on Windows and have a few things I&#39;m going to try. Whilst I may have caved to Apple once again for mobile computing, I refuse to use OS X in areas where I can avoid it.</p>
<p>And just as soon as somebody hacks Windows 8 for this thing, iOS is gone....</p>
<p>(no more blog posts typed on this thing...)</p>

<p>Pretty sure I promised pictures some time ago. Well, my iPhone sucks at taking pictures and video is better. Plus, it gave me an excuse to bust out some kinetic typography!</p>

<p>Ha! Now there&#39;s a title!</p>
<p>This year my bros and I will be attending <a href="http://www.tokyointulsa.com/">Tokyo in Tulsa</a> - a local anime convention - much as we did last year. However, this year not only will we be splurging on all three days, but we&#39;ll be shedding all our inhibitions and cosplaying. Well, at the very least I will. This is my fourth con, after all.</p>
<p>In addition to the costume getup itself, I am using this as an excuse to get my sorry ass into better shape. Since I&#39;ve started my new job, I&#39;ve been spending most of my lunch breaks climbing the stairs to the top of the building, about seventeen floors. In addition, lately I have also been walking around the small park adjacent to the building after said stair climbing (about a third of a mile or so).</p>
<p>Now, however, I will be stepping it up even more. My apartment has a pretty decent exercise facility and I plan to take advantage of it. So, tonight when everybody else has gone to sleep, I and my iPhone will make a trip across to the office and I will hit the treadmills.</p>
<p>My goal is that in the month and a half until the con, I can lose <em>some</em> of the fat roll and maybe even bring myself under 200 again. Honestly, that last part wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch - couple pounds a week, really.</p>
<p>So shall it be written, so shall it be done!</p>
</div></article><article class="post"><header class="post__header"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/the-balding-truth">The Balding Truth</a></h1><time class="post__published">June 2, 2011</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>So, I was watching a video today and the pre-roll ad was for some hair restoration product/service (don&#39;t recall which). At some point, one of the testimonials was all about how much more confidence this guy had now that he wasn&#39;t balding. And I&#39;m all like... you really rely on your hair to instill confidence? Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but I&#39;ve never understood what was so terrible about balding.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;ve always relished the thought of a receding hairline (sadly, the general consensus is that those genes passed me over). Sure, I&#39;ve always hated my hair and the fuss that must be made over it so it doesn&#39;t look stupid, but I&#39;ve always thought of bald as being both bad ass and/or dignified.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t share that mindset? Let&#39;s look at some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/patrick_stewart.jpg" alt="" title="Make it so!"></p>
<p>This guy has made his career out of being bald...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/bruce_willis.jpg" alt="" title="Yipee-ki-yay"></p>
<p>...and Mr. Willis here has proven that you can still be bad ass without hair (even if you make a shitty movie based upon a complete lack of knowledge of computers).</p>
<p>My only guess as to the negative imagery would probably be people who went bald, tried to correct it and failed:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/donald_trump.jpg" alt="" title="I demand your hair show it&#39;s birth certificate!"></p>
<p>My answer: just shave your head and stop worrying about it. Certainly don&#39;t go basing all your confidence on its existence.</p>
<p>Now, that beer belly is something different...</p>
