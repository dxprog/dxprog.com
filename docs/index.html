<p>2017 was not a great year. I&#39;m sure many others would say the same for various purposes and reasons, but mine are my own. I&#39;d argue that it was probably one of my most depressed years on record. Nothing seemed to click, outside of drinking and wallowing in similar misery with friends. There&#39;s <em>some</em> hyperbole in there; there were some reasonable moments of 2017, but it had the lowest lows, I think.</p>
<p>But we&#39;re not here to talk about depression. That&#39;s a post (or more) all its own.</p>
<p>Can you believe it&#39;s been <em>six years</em> since I last redesigned this blog? Indeed, for a sequence of time, <a href="https://dxprog.com/entry/this-site-of-yore/">redesigns were nearly annual</a>. I&#39;ve no doubt that part of the cool off was simply my entrance into web developent as a profession. I&#39;ve exactly one redesign since beginning my employ at the end 2009. No doubt running <a href="https://redditbooru.com">RedditBooru</a> and <a href="https://animebracket.com">AnimeBracket</a> on the side has contributed to the slacking as well. Who wants to rewrite a blog when you&#39;ve got two successful websites that demand attention?</p>
<p>But, six years man... that&#39;s a long time.</p>
<p>This redesign comes at a time where minimalism is at the forefront of design. Gone are the days of small text, gaudy colors, and rounded corners. In is simple to read typography and spatially considerate layouts. Makes it easier to style a website, for sure. But, I also went waaaaaaay back to basics on the site engine itself. Instead of the behemoth do-everything-and-framwork-for-the-rest CMS, this site is static. You won&#39;t find comments. You won&#39;t find metrics driver &quot;popular content&quot;. There is simply... content. And it&#39;s all created by me.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;ve not gone back to the days of hand authoring HTML files. I&#39;m better than that. This iteration of dxprog.com is powered by a static site generator that I wrote, because I&#39;ve not made one of those. The content is all markdown files and the layout is put together with React components. Initially, it was going to be a bunch of handlebars templates, but the notion of using nothing but a bunch of shareable React components to statically stitch a page together intrigued me. Seems to have worked, because here we are. My intention for the site generator itself was to be both standalone and also extensible via an npm package. This site is built the latter way. But, enough technical shit.</p>
<p>When will the next redesign be? Who knows. Six years from now, I&#39;ll be pushing forty.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a scary thought...</p>

So, Happy Thanksgiving, everybody, and I&#39;ll catch y&#39;all on the flip side. Maybe I&#39;ll have something to say. Maybe I won&#39;t. Who can tell?</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Soba</h2><time>November 21, 2016</time><div><p>Switching gears for a moment to document some soba I made off the top of my head. I&#39;ll try to keep the words to a minimum and let the pictures talk (zoom into the picture for recipe type shits).</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Q6KGxTN.jpg" alt="" title="Throw some water on to boil. Be sure to add salt!"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HyJpoOW.jpg" alt="" title="Get some butter melting in a pan."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j13cKrg.jpg" alt="" title="Chop up some onions and garlic. I used about a 1/4 and 3 cloves, respectively."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7wlC7QO.jpg" alt="" title="Saute the chopped stuff up."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j1btAYe.jpg" alt="" title="Once that water&#39;s boiling, add the soba. I like to swish it around for the first 15-30 seconds with chopsticks. Then, allow to boil for five minutes."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/h9lbBPC.jpg" alt="" title="Add a little water (2-3T), soy sauce (@-3T), mirin (1-2T), and honey (1-2T) into the sauteed stuffs, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer."></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gI0bGx9.jpg" alt="" title="Coat noodles with sauce and then enjoy!"></p>
<p>Chris and I had cold soba while in Sendai this year, though I&#39;m pretty sure the broth was nothing like this. To be honest, I haven&#39;t yet bothered to look up a recipe, but this sauce has worked pretty universally with various Japanese types of cuisine.</p>
<p>Authentic? Probably not.</p>
<p>Delicious?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Oh, Lordy Lord</h2><time>November 20, 2016</time><div><p>After finishing up last night&#39;s post, I decided to give that NES another try. The one thing I hadn&#39;t tried was the ever popular &quot;blow on the cartridge&quot; trick. It was the one thing that worked. I then proceeded to make a whole video of me playing it in the glitched up state...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mHXBIk91w"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/n9mHXBIk91w/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>Just a Quickie</h2><time>November 19, 2016</time><div><p>Just got out of a showing of Dr. Strange, a showing I opted for 3D over standard 2D. I don&#39;t regret my choice. It was a sweet movie with crazy effects and magic and some good old Marvel humor.</p>
<p>That said, it&#39;s now a bit late and I want a quick way out. So, here&#39;s a before and after photo of one of my recent broken NES aquisitions.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kW0U3hu.jpg" alt="" title="If you look closely, you can see a wire near the top right corner."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3Z3i8qw.jpg" alt="" title="SUCH A SHINY WITH THAT BLURRY DEPTH OF FIELD"></p>
<p>I have both of these machines, but the one on the right is the one in the after picture. The internals of the thing were fine, for the most part. The connector was shoddy as hell, though, so I refurb&#39;d the pins with a dental pick. After a little soak in the tub and a little scrubbing, it now plays games fabulously and <em>looks</em> fabulous too.</p>
<p>The one on the left has board issues of some sort, so when it does play at all, the graphics are all crazy go nuts. I wanted to grab a picture of Mario 3, but couldn&#39;t get the game to boot.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>That Time I Resolved a Copyright Complaint</h2><time>November 17, 2016</time><div><p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/that-time-i-got-to-file-a-copyright-claim/">yesterday&#39;s post</a>, I received an email from the company that produces the Ben Heck show. They were, of course, wondering what was up with the copyright claim and apologized since the production company switched between when the video was originally posted and now. The dude&#39;s name was Matt, so you know this is an an individual to be trusted.</p>
<p>Humor aside, I found working with him on the whole thing to be rather easy and pleasant. As stated above, he was apologetic, but professionally so. All he wanted was to have the video restored, all I wanted was an ask for permission and attribution. Over the course of a handful of emails, I retracted my copyright complaint, and the video reappeared on YouTube with one small change:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pNHr7su.png" alt="" title="That&#39;s my name, don&#39;t wear it out!"></p>
<p>Now that this whole issue has been nicely resolved, I can finally feel that little bit of accomplishment knowing that some of my design work is being seen hundreds of thousands of people and enticing them to watch the video.</p>
<p>Really, that&#39;s pretty cool.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>That Time I Got to File a Copyright Claim</h2><time>November 16, 2016</time><div><p>About nine years ago, I went to college. While I was there, I did things with Adobe programs. One of those things was a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/wherein-the-author-imparts-upon-his-audience-the-ongoings-of-his-life/">vectored NES</a>. That version is actually the second of two attempts for that class. My original was based off of an <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/nintendo_nes_1s.jpg">image I&#39;d found on google search</a> and it was fucking awful.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tCifkJ1.png" alt="" title="There&#39;s a reason it never got finished"></p>
<p>Unhappy with that, I took my own photo, getting the angles and such that I wanted.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Q7tGZh4.png" alt="" title="That&#39;s my DAD portfolio bag in the background"></p>
<p>Which, if you didn&#39;t click the blog link above, resulted in this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fmeztvu.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s actually not bad."></p>
<p>While I&#39;m here explaining the whole backstory, I will call attention to two things wrong with this image:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Nintendo&quot; has no registered trademark symbol.</li>
<li>&quot;Entertainment System&quot;, &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;Reset&quot;, and the controller port numbers are some computery looking system font that ships with OS X.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast forward nine years.</p>
<p>Recall in a post <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/hobbies-hobbies-hobbies/">a few days ago</a> where I mentioned how I was currently binging arcade repair videos (a thing I&#39;m still doing). That stemmed from just watching a bunch of electronics videos before that, and when you do this a lot, YouTube catches on and recommends other similar videos. One channel that&#39;s right up that alley is the <em>Ben Heck Show</em>, the long running electronic projects series by Internet famous console modder and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Video-Game-Consoles-ExtremeTech/dp/0764578065/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1479359208&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;keywords=ben+heck">published author</a>, Ben Heckendorn. So, consider my surprise when I&#39;m scrolling through recommendations and I see this:</p>
<p><img src="http://videos.revision3.com/revision3/images/shows/tbhs/0067/tbhs--0067--slot-loading-nintendo-game-system-part-1--marge.thumb.jpg" alt="" title="Mighty familiar..."></p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow, but didn&#39;t think too much of it at the time. I figured that it was just a really similar image or they&#39;d used the same photograph I based mine off of. It&#39;d been nine years, and I&#39;d forgotten that <em>I</em> took that photograph. So, life moved on.</p>
<p>But YouTube was apparently desperate for me to watch this video, because they would not stop recommending it. Each time I saw the thumbnail, I&#39;d inspect that NES a little harder. I was skeptical enough to dig up my version from deviantArt and saw the similarities. <a href="https://twitter.com/dxprog/status/780199222448500736">I tweeted Ben Heck that something seemed amiss</a>. Eventually, that nugget of doubt brought forth the vague recollection: &quot;wait... didn&#39;t I take that photo?&quot;. Lucky for me, I have nearly all of my source files from school and I was able to dig that out of the Illustrator file. But just to be extra certain, I dug up the big thumbnail picture, fired up After Effects, and made this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/3o7TKuMqE7kV9siYnK.gif" alt="" title="Oh shit..."></p>
<p>That&#39;s pretty damning, but the final nail in the coffin is in the small details: the registered trademark on Nintendo is missing, and the &quot;Nintendo Entertainment System&quot; font is that shitty LED sign font. (Now that I think about it, I may have snatched that from dafont.com. I baked the paths in my Illustrator file, so I can&#39;t tell.)</p>
<p>Ben Heck and his show ripped off my work.</p>
<p>I was a little ticked, but more out of principle. This was a professionally produced show and, instead of acting like professionals and ensuring all royalties and licensing is squared away for externally sourced assets, just waltzed into Google image search and picked whatever suited their fancy without caring. Sadly, I&#39;m sure that this happens all the time. Luckily for me (and I literally just realized this), but I released that image under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">an atribution/non commercial Creative Commons license</a> (very forward thinking on my part). Long story short: you can use the image only for non-commercial purposes (Ben Heck show is very much commercial) and if you do use it, give me credit (which they did not do).</p>
<p>And you know what? If they had just <em>asked</em>, I would have gladly given permission and been beside myself that my work was seen to be good enough for use on a show that I already enjoyed. They certainly couldn&#39;t hide behind the excuse of &quot;we couldn&#39;t find the creator&quot;, because when that image shows up on Google image search, it goes to that deviantArt page or my blog. All of these have non-hidden ways of contacting me.</p>
<p>Armed with my little gif and a bit of anger, <a href="https://twitter.com/dxprog/status/780421116875550720">I passively aggressively tweeted all this at Ben Heck, his sponsor, and the production company</a>. No response. (In Rev3&#39;s defense, I think they&#39;re dead.)</p>
<p>It would probably have ended there, my small rage subsiding with the passing forgetfulness of time. However, YouTube just. Kept. Recommending. That. Video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvijyBIgazE&amp;t=34s">I think Christmas Story summed up my feelings best</a> (and, no, the irony of linking to an illegal clip of a video in a post about copyright is not lost on me).</p>
<p>So, I filed a copyright report on it.</p>
<p>Next day, YouTube&#39;s copyright department emailed back asking for additional proof, which I provided in a more compact version of the above. This morning, I received this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UQiSPYf.png" alt="" title="Delicious.">
As of this writing, that video has been removed from YouTube search, Google search (surprisingly fast on that), and if you try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdzZIeemumo">visit the video itself</a>, you&#39;re greeted with this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LUgvlSS.png" alt="" title="So, so delicious"></p>
<p>My favorite part is how it says my name.</p>
<p>Morals of the story are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you&#39;re working professionally in a professional industry, be professional</li>
<li>Just ask. It doesn&#39;t hurt anybody and you might just get permission.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t fuck with me?</li>
</ol>
</div></article><article><h2>The Fabric Unravels</h2><time>November 15, 2016</time><div><p>I don&#39;t know what to write about.</p>
<p>All things considered, I could still &quot;win&quot; this thing if I missed a day. But, who said this was a contest? It&#39;s more of a &quot;this is a thing we want to do, let&#39;s draw strength and encouragement from each other&quot;. Kinda like a diet buddy, but with words instead.</p>
<p>I&#39;m forced to wonder, however: what exactly am I getting out of this? Sure, for the past year or so I&#39;ve wanted to write about serious topics that weigh on my mind. But, instead of actually trying to put that stuff to words, I&#39;m bullshitting a paragraph of text. The weird thing is, as I&#39;m typing this, I know that all this rambling will come off like some disturbed and emo teenager on LiveJournal in the mid-00s.</p>
<p>I was just telling my mom this evening that I write this blog for me. So, given that, why should I care what words I lay down? I&#39;m me and I understand the context within all this is written. Of course, come next year I&#39;ll have lost that and be just another outsider looking in with only a vague recollection of the times my current self was going through. But, even given that, it&#39;s still me so why should I worry?</p>
<p>Aha!</p>
<p>Despite this notion of writing for my future self, I&#39;m fully aware of the publicness of these ramblings. Any Joe Schmoe (or people I know and know read this blog) can and will happen upon this post. If they&#39;ve made it this far, they&#39;re wondering &quot;okay... just how crazy <em>is</em> Matt?&quot; And I&#39;m aware of all this.</p>
<p>As I continue to type.</p>
<p>Fully knowing that eyebrows will be raised. Raised in a curious pondering, perhaps a tinged with a little worry.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>I Guess I&#x27;ll Write About Anime?</h2><time>November 14, 2016</time><div><p>I dunno. Running out of ideas to write about that aren&#39;t heavy, heavy topics. So, instead I&#39;ll write little blips about the anime shows I&#39;ve sampled this season.</p>
<p><strong>WWW.Working!!</strong> - Sidequel to one of my favorite shows, Working!! Same universe, same restaurant chain, different actual restaurant and, thus, different cast of characters. Each one has their own particular tick, and each week we&#39;re given a glimpse into their interactions with each other. I haven&#39;t warmed up to these new characters yet, but I&#39;ll give it time.</p>
<p><strong>Flip Flappers</strong> - Just watched this last night, but don&#39;t recall much. Some space girl finds some other girl and then are teleported by a pet robot into some &quot;Illusion Zone&quot; or whatever. Hijinks ensue, turns out everybody is a magical girl, there&#39;s some yuri undertones, and the credits roll. It was bright and shiny and had some fluid animation. Reminded me of a studio Trigger knock off.</p>
<p><strong>Girlish Number</strong> - Looks like my favorite characters from &quot;Gekkan Shouko Nozaki-kun&quot; and &quot;Humanity Has Declined&quot; have been rolled into one up-and-coming voice actor. Sweet on the outside, utterly cynical on the inside, you have that ol&#39; fashioned Japan cute factor mixed with sassy inner monologue and it&#39;s quite lovely. I think I shall continue to watch this show.</p>
<p><strong>Kiss Him, Not Me</strong> - Here&#39;s a fun one to explain. Nerdy, pervy (creepy pervy), overweight girl is so destroyed by the death of a character in one of her shows, that she locks herself in her room for a week and, when she exits, is suddenly thin and gorgeous. Naturally, she gathers a harem of love-struck boys at school. I&#39;ve never watched a reverse harem before, but after seeing this, all the flaws in the harem shows I&#39;ve sometimes enjoyed are completely exposed. Naked before my mind to comprehend... I might watch a couple more episodes.</p>
<p><strong>My Wife is the Student Council President</strong> - I&#39;m convinced the animators of this show are just trying to find the line with the censors. There&#39;s really nothing more that can be said. It&#39;s a terrible piece of garbage and I am watching it...</p>
<p><strong>Yuri on Ice</strong> - It&#39;s the ice skating equivalent to &quot;Free&quot;. Kid did a bunch of figure skating in high school, flopped at some big competition, got fat for a while, but suddenly his Russian rival (and man crush) swoops in to train the poor boy. There&#39;s lots of pretty boys and abs and cleverly placed branches. The story itself is compelling enough that I may continue to watch, but I do not believe I&#39;m the target audience...</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen. Oddly busy season for me.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Round 2</h2><time>November 13, 2016</time><div><p>Want to polish up my LED grid a bit before writing more on that, so I&#39;m going to do that &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; thing again. Giving myself four minutes out of the gate, this time. And... WE&#39;RE OFF!</p>
<p>The easiest thing to start this off on is my day. Or my weekend? We&#39;ll stick with day, it&#39;s a lot shorter and I only have so much time.</p>
<p>Attempted to move the voltage converter circuit off the breadboard and onto a circuit board. Got everything designed up in Eagle, fidgeted with the printer for a bit because printers suck, and then attempted to iron it onto a copper board. Well.... that didn&#39;t go so great, so maybe I&#39;ll just solder everything up on a perfboard. Still, I want to get this etching shit figured out.</p>
<p>Other things I did today was gorge on &#39;Nilla Wafers. There are a lot of things I would say are &quot;krytonite-esque&quot; for me, but &#39;Nilla Wafers are the real deal. I fucking love these things and always have. They&#39;re cookies, clearly, but there&#39;s something special in their simplicity. The way the crumble under the pressure of your tongue as the spit in your mouth begins to slowly dissolve the cookie. The rush of flavor that dances across your taste buds as those little crumbles brush past. Oh, what&#39;s this? Looks like somebody has decided to douse the whole scene in some lovely, lovely milk. The flavors are mingling together, creating an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. You savor the -</p>
<p>TIME&#39;S UP!</p>
<p>Guess I had a bit of a Remy from Ratatouille moment, there. Play with matches only if you&#39;re going to do something cool... like set things on fire!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Phoning it in for a Thing I Did</h2><time>November 12, 2016</time><div><p>My Mario 64 cart arrived today, so I clearly can&#39;t be bothered to write a full blog post. Instead, here&#39;s a video of a thing I&#39;ll be writing about <em>very</em> soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16qvLoxmdak"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/16qvLoxmdak/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>1 and 2, A and B</h2><time>November 11, 2016</time><div><p>The last couple years or so, I&#39;ve been on a big Alan Parsons Project kick. This no doubt stemmed from my dad getting me a compilation album for Christmas. Since, I&#39;ve purchased most of the albums on LP and have listened to them quite often. The aforementioned compilation set gets frequent playback in the car, which means I&#39;m listening to it a lot because the Bay&#39;s commute traffic is awful.</p>
<p>When listening to an artist so much, you start to pick up on things they like to do. One of these I noticed about Alan Parsons Project is what I&#39;m going to call &quot;setup, opposite comparator&quot; (or SOC). Over the course of a verse, a series of back-to-back comparisons (often opposites) are made. Here&#39;s a bunch of examples:</p>
<h2 id="what-goes-up-pyramid-">What goes up... (Pyramid)</h2>
<p><em>What goes up, must come down</em>
<em>What must rise, must fall</em></p>
<h2 id="gemeni-eye-in-the-sky-">Gemeni (Eye in the Sky)</h2>
<p><em>Watching, waiting</em>
<em>Rising, falling</em>
<em>Listening, calling</em>
...
<em>Touching, feeling</em>
<em>Seeing, believing</em></p>
<h2 id="psychobabble-eye-in-the-sky-">Psychobabble (Eye in the Sky)</h2>
<p><em>It ain&#39;t Kodachrome and it isn&#39;t black and white</em>
...
<em>Well, I&#39;m never on my own but there&#39;s nobody in sight</em>
...
<em>It&#39;s in Dolby stereo but I never hear it right</em>
...
<em>Well, I see the way to go but there isn&#39;t any light</em></p>
<p>and the Queen Mother of all of them is <em>You Don&#39;t Believe</em> which I won&#39;t write down, because the whole song is a series of SOCs. Check for yourself:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylcHHb93GRo"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ylcHHb93GRo/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed a few of these, but those were the one&#39;s off the top of my head. It&#39;s an interesting hallmark of the group for sure.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Blurp Blop Bloop</h2><time>November 9, 2016</time><div><p>We&#39;ll not consider what today means. Instead, here&#39;s a non-edited, slightly stoned, 100% stream of consciousness that was typed over the course of two minutes starting... NOW!</p>
<p>As I hit the enter key, &quot;Stay Alive&quot; (the last ED for Re:Zero) started playing. I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;m probably waning on favor of this song. It&#39;s a good song, no doubt, but I have a hunch I won&#39;t be listening to it in a week.</p>
<p>Speaking of a week, I came up with a hair brained scheme. In my 1:1 with my manager tomorrow, I&#39;m going to pitch the idea of working remotely in Japan for 3-6 months. I think it&#39;d effectively scratch that itch, because I do love that country so much. People talk about having home sickness, well I&#39;ve had this feeling only a couple of times:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2008 when I was in college and about to leave back for Orlando following Christmas break</li>
<li>Every single God. Damned. Time I come back from Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t know what it is about being over there that feels so right, but I want to have the opportunity to test if it&#39;s just me following the &quot;high&quot; of something new or if I really resonate with life over there that much.</p>
<p>Okay, so the timer went off while writing the above bit, but I had to finish it and added a couple of minutes. I suppose I can bullshit until it goes off...</p>
<p>Sheep are weird, right? They&#39;re both meat AND clothing. That&#39;s not weird, I suppose. Pigs and cows provide leather, after all. And that&#39;s like... a car delicacy.</p>
<p>Oh shit! The timer went off.</p>
<p>Alright, folks. Remember to drive safely and that drugs are bad, m&#39;kay.</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>Why is she holding a dirty spoon? She&#39;s clearly not cooking as can be noted by the exceptionally clean counters.</p>
<p>What exactly is she doing? Singing into her dirty spoon?</p>
<p>Where is the oven? Were there any dishes around, I&#39;d expect to see maybe a chocolate cake or brownies... but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a place to cook them.</p>
<p>Her outfit seems very 90s. Denim jumper thing with leggings. Hell, the might even be stirrup pants and the stirrups are covered by socks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a curious thing.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s a Whatever Kind of Post</h2><time>November 7, 2016</time><div><p>I don&#39;t have anything particular to say, this evening. I&#39;ve just returned from a team bonding exercise, aka going out to bar and having drinks and conversation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is election day, and dear god will I be happy for that to be over. The previous election seasons have been a bit of a shit show, but this year takes the fucking cake. My voting has already been taken care of, thanks to the mail in ballot, which is probably the best way to vote. I was able to sit down for an hour or so and, while I was filling out my ballot, research all the various questions, what they were really introducing, and make an informed decision about my vote.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just for the state propositions. I skipped most of the &quot;position&quot; votes because I don&#39;t care or am not informed enough (even with that research), save for two:</p>
<p>I voted for Hillary, because I feel she&#39;s just going to be status quo. Not only that, but I can&#39;t pretend to stand behind my morals and cast a vote for Trump. Unlike my father who, despite years of decrying the man, will vote for him regardless because it&#39;s a vote for his team, which has lost in the last two elections. That&#39;s all it boils down to for him, and I clearly disagree in this regard. Though I don&#39;t think Trump would have enough political power or clout to do the heinous things he&#39;s talked about, I&#39;m not about to sully what&#39;s left of my soul by backing the man (party affiliation be damned).</p>
<p>The other position I voted for was a write in. Why? Because there were only two options to vote fore: the one guy that was on there, or whomever I pleased. So I voted for my friend <a href="http://cmimg.dxprog.com/cm_20060430_1.png">devbus</a>. because it clearly doesn&#39;t matter how that vote goes.</p>
<p>I suppose this was slightly more than a &quot;whatever&quot; post, but scrolling through my Facebook feed gave me the ire to talk about how much I&#39;m sick of this goddamned election, much like I&#39;m sick of it every year it happens. I&#39;m ready for things to go back to normal.</p>
<p>Whatever that is...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Music... Sunday Evening?</h2><time>November 6, 2016</time><div><p>My mom does this thing on her blog called &quot;music monday&quot; where she chooses some song and then writes about the lyrics and how it relates to her or discussing the meaning. I&#39;m going to do that, but with two changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&#39;s Sunday</li>
<li>the song I&#39;m choosing is sung in Gaelic and I have no idea what it means</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-best-is-yet-to-come-metal-gear-solid">The Best is Yet to Come - Metal Gear Solid</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6miaTf1gF4g"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/6miaTf1gF4g/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p><em>The Best is Yet to Come</em> is the song you hear upon completing Metal Gear Solid. It begins playing after we&#39;ve watched Snake and Meryl (or Otacon, if you fucked up) take off across the snow swept plains of Alaska. It&#39;s a lovely and haunting piece that captures the exact essence of &quot;Alaskan Plains&quot;.</p>
<p>I first heard this song back in college upon completing Metal Gear Solid for the first time. You could say it was love at first... hear? and made it straight into rotation. I have a particularly vivid memory of a long walk on the Cady Way Trail on my way to deposit a living expense check. There&#39;s a point on the trail where it runs through a bunch of trees, making it feel like walking through a tree tunnel. This was on a particularly fall-like day, with the leaves turning various shades of orange and brown, and there was even a slight crisp feeling to the air. <em>The Best is Yet to Come</em> began playing on my phone/mp3 player and provided the most perfect music accompaniment to the scene laid out around me. Almost made the 8 mile round trip bearable...</p>
<p>Every year around the fall/winter months, I put this song back into rotation. Playing it a little more than usual this year, not sure why. Perhaps because it accentuates what little there is of a fall feeling in the Bay. Perhaps I&#39;m feeling just a tad melancholic.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&#39;s just a damn good song.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>11 years ago...</h2><time>November 5, 2016</time><div><p>Eleven years ago (to the day, I believe), I began my term at Walmart, back when it was still spelled with a dash. At that time, I took this picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/matt_money_man.jpg" alt="" title="Always for the money... always"></p>
<p>While I was visiting folks in September, I found my old vests back (which is to say my brother had held on to them all this time). Having hauled them back to the Bay with me, I decided that I&#39;d dress up as old cashier Matt for Halloween and wore the vest to work. Here&#39;s that same picture updated for modern times:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/ug04.jpg" alt="" title="I have since grown a sexy beard"></p>
<p>Looking back, I realized I was quite proud to be working at that store. Moreso than anything, I was probably just happy to have a job, but looking back on it, there was something to be proud of. During my not-quite-two years there, I went from quiet coder to a sociable person who could hold his own in the world. I worked in almost every department in the store in an attempt to be one of the most versitible people there. It was also slightly self-serving in that it allowed me to do something slightly different a lot, but that shit looks amazing in the eyes of management. I topped out at cashier &quot;management&quot;, which is really just ensuring the front-end was well manned and that cashiers get their breaks/lunch on time, gaining me the coveted red coat. It didn&#39;t last, as I went to cart pusher for the last few months there, but in retrospect, I&#39;m pretty proud of what I accomplished in the little time I was there.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a luxurious job, but I&#39;ll treasure what that time meant to me... always.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>CNC - Create Nice Crafts</h2><time>November 4, 2016</time><div><p>... or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">computer numerical control</a>.</p>
<p>As was touched upon previously, I am the owner of a shiny CNC machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/ufpm.jpg" alt="" title="LOOK AT THE SHINY"></p>
<p>This thing excites the hell out of me because I basically have a tiny little wood shop robot that can make art, and parts, and gifts, and who knows what else. There&#39;s only one thing complicating the matter</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/ufpn.jpg" alt="" title="sadtrombone.wav"></p>
<p>Turns out it&#39;s not as simple as saying &quot;print&quot; like my 3D printer. No, there&#39;s much to know about endmills, feed rates, router speeds, plunge rates, and a whole plethora of maths and terminology. In the above, I tried to make a grid of holes, but these all failed in various ways. The holes were all lopsided and, towards the end of the milling operation, the whole router would take this weird turn too early and would chew up the rest of the work. I was confused and getting a bit frustrated and down on the whole thing.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am not the only one throwing a CNC party. In fact, I&#39;m the last one on the bandwagon. Between myself and a couple of other coworkers, we&#39;re kind of trudging through this world together, exchanging knowledge and tidbits as we learn them. It was during these CNC talk lunches that I overheard what my problem might be.</p>
<p>Check the belt tension.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/ufpo.jpg" alt="" title="SHINY"></p>
<p>Well, that fixed everything. There&#39;s still some things to consider like non-manual dust collection (I currently follow the router with a vacuum hose) and contraptions to hold the stock material down. But, you&#39;ve gotta admit. That hunk of cherry is a sexy piece of wood. Let&#39;s have another glamour shot.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/ufpp.jpg" alt="" title="SO SHINY"></p>
<p>I&#39;m now stoked to start making a bunch of cool shit. Perhaps we&#39;ll being seeing more on the blog this month :O</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Hobbies, Hobbies, Hobbies</h2><time>November 3, 2016</time><div><p>In the last several months, I seem to have gotten into this kick of trying out hobbies. Not sure if it&#39;s some middle age crisis thing or what, but it&#39;s been an interesting journey.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the things I&#39;ve given a shot to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making beer and wine</li>
<li>Automating stuff in my apartment</li>
<li>Testing out various small electronics projects (so much soldering...)</li>
<li>Lots of research into arcade machine repair (lots of YouTube videos on the subject)</li>
<li>Attempting actual repair of old NES machines (lemme know if you need your cartridge connector refurb&#39;d. I can do that all day!)</li>
<li>CNC milling</li>
</ul>
<p>The electronics binge particularly has been a hell of a lot of fun. I&#39;ve yet to actually fully complete a project, but I&#39;ve prototype&#39;d an LED matrix, a camera shutter timer, and a rhythm game controller. I&#39;ve done quite a bit of research into circuit board etching and think I&#39;ve settled on a good solution that relies on fewer caustic chemicals. I just need to design up a board to test all that out with. Combine all that with the CNC machine and I&#39;m hoping to bring some spit and polish to those projects I mentioned.</p>
<p>In future posts, I&#39;ll probably elaborate more on some of these builds and what I&#39;ve learned from them. In the mean time, my mad scientist desk probably needs some decluttering...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/ufb6.jpg" alt="" title="So much shit..."></p>
</div></article><article><h2>チャレンジ</h2><time>November 2, 2016</time><div><p>I doubt that title&#39;s even gonna render correctly...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not beat around the bush, here: this blog has been a fucking ghost town for quite some time now. Last year was quiet, but the only thing I&#39;ve written at <em>all</em> this year is an out-of-nowhere post about a frog watering contraption. Kind of sad, really. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t have anything to write about, necessarily, but can&#39;t quite figure out the &quot;correct&quot; way to write it. One thing leads to another, and that generally lead to nothing in the end.</p>
<p>That brings us to here. At the suggestion of my <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2016/11/blog-throwdown-2016/">dearest mother</a>, we&#39;ll be doing one of those post-a-day challenges for the month of November. She&#39;s started off by writing about how she&#39;s slowly becoming an evening alcoholic (I kid, I kid), but I&#39;m not sure where to begin.</p>
<p>2016 has been a rather strange year, for sure. It might actually be one of my busiest on record, but it doesn&#39;t really feel like I&#39;ve accomplished anything. Here&#39;s a bulleted list of things that may or may not become posts later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spent a couple weekends in snowy Tahoe with friends</li>
<li>Threw not one, but <em>two</em> little parties at my apartment</li>
<li>Quit LinkedIn</li>
<li>Visited Japan</li>
<li>Started working at Twitch</li>
<li>Quit working at Twitch</li>
<li>Meandered around in unemployment for a while</li>
<li>Started working at LinkedIn again</li>
<li>Made a road trip to Seattle, visiting friends and family along the way</li>
<li>Housed a friend and colleague from work for a week</li>
<li>Various other ancillary things</li>
</ul>
<p>The work nonsense is certainly the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; of this blog escapade, so I&#39;ll probably start on that tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this is a post with words that hasn&#39;t really said anything in particular. Good thing this is a quantity and not quality challenge!</p>

<p>To that last point, I booked a rather spur of the moment trip to visit good ol&#39; [devbus)(<a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/</a>) over the long weekend. Now, the frog (who from hereon out will be referred to as &quot;Warner&quot;) can live with some neglect, particularly on the food side of things. I&#39;ll only be gone four days, which should be fine. Still, he should be kept moist regularly and that&#39;s been weighing on my soul.</p>
<p>Enter the Automated Warner Waterer! (Or, &quot;aww&quot; for short)</p>
<h2 id="the-supplies">The Supplies</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/tu48.jpg" alt="" title="SUPPLIES!"></p>
<ul>
<li>One small fountain pump (picked up at Home Depot)</li>
<li>Some 1/4&quot; tubing</li>
<li>Plugs for said tubing</li>
<li>One Raspberry Pi (I used a 3)</li>
<li>One <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/christmas-lights-extravaganza/">reused, relay-controlled gangbox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Excluding the Pi and the box which I already had, I spent about $25 for everything. Not too shabby. Oh, and this isn&#39;t meant to be a blog-by-blow tutorial. I&#39;m not instructables...</p>
<h2 id="building-it">Building It</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/tu4b.jpg" alt="" title="If you look real closely, you can see Warner"></p>
<p>The water pump and tubing stuff came together pretty easily, the stuff that I figured would be difficult. Despite it being drip tubing, I wound up punching some holes as the pump wasn&#39;t strong enough to force the water through. Other than that, cake all the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/tu49.jpg" alt="" title="So much wires"></p>
<p>Setting up the script and such to control it via the Raspberry Pi turned out to be trickier, or the part I figured would be easy. Some stuff I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pi has 5v out, which is great for my relay card. But the GPIO pins are only 3.3v, something my relay card did <em>not</em> like. An NPN transistor fixed this.</li>
<li>The relays themselves are active when they&#39;re pulled low, something I do not recall when messing with them before. Had to do some rewiring so that the pump would be off when the relay is engaged (which is basically all the time when the Pi is on). This of course means that if the Pi loses power, that pump will always be on.</li>
<li>When running something as a cron job, you don&#39;t get the benefits of running with that user&#39;s shell. So, when you run node, you need to absolute path to that</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.awwni.me/tu4a.jpg" alt="" title="The business end"></p>
<p>The way everything is set up now, I can manually water Warner by running the script through SSH, but it&#39;s also set to water for fifteen seconds every day at 3PM. In addition to that, it will reboot the Pi at 3:01PM, resetting the GPIO pins and shutting off the pump just in case something went wrong and the script hung with the pump on. MY CODE HAS LIVES IN THE BALANCE.</p>
<p>A pretty good way to spend half a day and it&#39;ll make me feel more at ease while I&#39;m away.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Yearly Time Travel Trip</h2><time>December 20, 2015</time><div><p>As has now become a yearly tradition, words from my past self to my present day self arrived this 21st of December. Here is what I had to say.</p>
<p>[quote]Dear FutureMe,</p>
<p>Here we are once again. We&#39;ll skip the pleasantries and get right to the heart.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I&#39;m a bit apprehensive about how next year is going to go down, at least as far as work goes. Being understaffed and rewriting the entire stack in the time the PMs are allotting is worrisome to be sure. I&#39;m hoping that there will be no long nights (certainly impossible odds), but the realist in my is not optimistic.</p>
<p>I am, however, slightly more optimistic about that trip to Japan with your coworkers. The tickets are soon to be bought as I write this which will essentially seal three people into that deal. How things will play out while there, though, remains a bit shaded to me.</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan, don&#39;t really expect anything to come of the 3 month work stint over there, but it would certainly be nice. Oh, and this is of course assuming that you&#39;re still at LI, though I can&#39;t see any reason why you wouldn&#39;t be. That gig, though the honeymoon is over, is still pretty sweet.</p>
<p>On the girlfriend front... sigh... I can&#39;t really make any predictions. I&#39;ve become disillusioned with the effectiveness of online dating as it doesn&#39;t pair you up with a person in any natural sort of way. Maybe with that senior promotion (presumably that&#39;ll happen sooner rather than later), you&#39;ll get some extra confidence and balls and can converse with ladies on a &quot;cold call&quot; type basis.</p>
<p>It seems these letters are getting longer each year I write them, so the wrapping shall begin here.</p>
<p>Oh, you need to bike over 2000 miles next year and get your fat body into shape. Please do that for me.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is probably the most accurate thing I&#39;ve written to date. Project Voyager, which I played a marginally large-ish role in for a while (lead web developer for the new &quot;Me&quot; page), was an absolute nightmare to work on, and continues to be in some cases. Any project that has people tossing out the term &quot;PTSD&quot; for those who have abandoned ship is not one that should be praised too heavily. In the initial stages, I did a lot of actual yelling in anger and frustration in trying to keep the expectations sane. During the course of the year, I entered what was probably actually some level of depression. I nearly stopped doing things after work at all, trying to keep what time I wasn&#39;t at work to myself just to recover so I could go and face it again the next day or week. In the end, I bailed from the project entirely (in the most hush-hush way I could, except for the long essay I wrote to managers about my thoughts on the mess). I attempted to flee to Facebook, making it all the way through the interview process only to be turned down, so instead just went to a different team which still has me working tangentially on Voyager. It&#39;s much calmer and saner overall and I&#39;m slowly beginning to return to &quot;normal&quot;, whatever that is.</p>
<p>Japan is a thing that happened, though, with a couple of work friends and myself making a pilgrimage to my home away from America. I&#39;d like to say that this trip was way more successful than the one my brothers and I took. We went to more places, saw more stuff, and ate a larger variety of food. We hung out with the fine folk at the Tokyo LinkedIn office, who are exceptionally good at partying (from karaoke to playing wingman in Ropongi bars). To that last point, I had every opportunity to nail a drunk Japanese chick, but even my level of inebriation did not allow me miss the last train back to our hotel (our flight was the next day). Of course, I came back with all manner of used figures and such to adorn my various shelves.</p>
<p>Yeah, the girlfriend thing continues to elude me. I went on a couple-ish dates this year, but neither I didn&#39;t consider to be enough of a personality fit to continue pursuing (or other various circumstances). 2016 is the year I want to turn my lack of love life around (which is the equivalent of saying it&#39;ll be the year of the Linux desktop) because I&#39;m getting bummed out watching everybody around me get married and have kids.</p>
<p>Finally, I think I biked six or seven hundred miles this year. Nothing to write home about after the 1800 I biked last year. I&#39;m fatter than ever, but I think I&#39;ve fleshed out a nice little plan for once the holidays and their gluttonous wiles have played out. Getting into shape will play heavily into the dating thing, methinks.</p>
<p>And with that, I will now go and pen the letter I will be reading and writing about next year.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Thought</h2><time>November 13, 2015</time><div><p>I don&#39;t like talking about things in the political or socio-economic realm. I abhor it, even. A couple reasons, A) I&#39;m bad at it, B) it requires an emotional component that I don&#39;t have enough of. That said, I&#39;m going to make a societal rant.</p>
<p>I of course am going to be speaking of the recent unpleasantness going down in France. I&#39;ve been quasi-monitoring various threads on reddit and - unsurprisingly - it would seem the collective world&#39;s head is turned to look at Islam (or, rather, Muslims) as being the cause. Now, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if extremists who claim to be working in the name of this religion are involved, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here. Well, I suppose it is. A lot of the sentiment seems to be around the notion that this particular religion is <em>making</em> people do this.</p>
<p>No. No it&#39;s not. And the people who claim this are themselves probably hypocrites.</p>
<p>I had an interesting thought as I was grabbing a piece of cheese from the fridge. It&#39;s the exact same argument as &quot;video games make those who play them violent&quot;. I&#39;ve written about this before, maybe here, maybe for school, but the answer is: no, of course they don&#39;t. A video game, movie, book, or piece of music doesn&#39;t make you violent. If you&#39;re acting out on things, you were probably pre-disposed to such things already. The <em>exact same idea</em> applies to this notion that a religion will turn somebody violent.</p>
<p>These individuals <em>chose</em> to kill of their own free will. We as humans kind of have that privilege.</p>
<p>In the end it&#39;s not video games and it&#39;s not religion causing people to cause fucked up mayhem against innocent lives. It&#39;s extremely disturbed individuals who will find any reason to validate the horrendous crimes they already want to commit. Intangible concepts don&#39;t cause people to kill.</p>
<p>People do that all by themselves.</p>
<p>And it goes without saying that they are acting and representing themselves and themselves only, not the whole. They may represent a subset of people, but simply by being human, they actually represent all people.</p>
<p>So, if you subscribe to the group mindset, does that not make all of us murderers?</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Idiocy, Caching, and Reducing Round Trips</h2><time>July 7, 2015</time><div><p>Over the last few days, I&#39;d been receiving high CPU usage alerts from my host. A tad perplexed, I&#39;d login in, check the graph and logs to see that, indeed, CPU usage was high, but nothing really seemed out of the ordinary. Google Analytics showed that traffic was moderately high, to be expected with a few widely visible brackets going on in /r/anime, but it wasn&#39;t anything to raise an eyebrow at. Still, you can&#39;t look at the following graph and notice a very predictable period of high activity:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0IUrapB.png" alt="" title="Those peaks would be terrible to bike up"></p>
<p>These peaks were actually coinciding with the most prominent bracket updating, bringing with it a fresh wave users every day. By the time I had received the third CPU alert email, I knew something was up and decided to actually take a look. Luckily, I didn&#39;t have to look far. The MySQL query graph was showing 1000+ read queries per second, certainly out of ordinary given how aggressive I am about caching.</p>
<p>Suspecting that something might be awry with memcache, but not actually wanting to bounce it, I bugged the cache library with some <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/anime-bracket/commit/9e96a5838d06e0d3fc034cbc08653ab3329c8c5f">stats tracking</a> hoping that it would turn up something I had overlooked. Indeed, I know where things are cached, but have never really had a list of just how all of this looks in production. And, true to that, I found something that I had not anticipated: every call to Dal::getById - a method on a class that database models extend - was a cache miss. Every. Single. One. And there were thousands of these, which very quickly explained the high query volume. All of this I found out in about 30 seconds of having that profiling code live, which is good because it also brought the site down and I had to disable it...</p>
<p>With that information, I had a pretty solid lead as to where I needed to be checking for issues: the aforementioned getById method. I was a bit baffled because I knew there should be caching on that, it&#39;s one of the two reasons that the method even exists (the other reason being for coding simplicity). So I get in there and take a look. Lo and behold, the cache is checked but <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/anime-bracket/commit/5455f8bc589e4f924714463857c8b8cf64eecb37">nothing was ever actually stored back</a>. Of course, I had to fuck the fix up once before <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/anime-bracket/commit/46618c77c0cf58a9f8555f05f86a413817bb3069">actually resolving it</a>.</p>
<p>Once that was shoved to production, I was greeted with this wonderful little sight:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.snag.gy/bGki8.jpg" alt="" title="Down.. down.. down.. ROCK LOBSTER"></p>
<p>So, the immediate issue was fixed, but there was still something obviously very wrong if I was individually getting so many singular items by ID. As it turns out, in one of the most looped pieces of code in the entire project, I was making not one but <em>two</em> calls to get an item by ID. The whole output was cache guarded, but on a per user basis. In the case of the popular running bracket, that&#39;s over 400 queries per user per page generation. Unacceptable.</p>
<p>So, in one of those cases of code brevity != code speed, <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/anime-bracket/commit/dd6a4251c94ca47454abd6a004c2d64c952664da">I did a heavy refactor to stash all the IDs that needed to be fetched and then make a big batch call later</a>. There are some trade-offs here. There&#39;s still room for optimization here, especially if the getById calls are aggressively cached (indeed, the data fetched changes rarely). Or, the data returned from the batched call could be cached in shorter intervals. It still needs to be looped through as it&#39;s decorated with user specific data, but that would bring the overhead down to one big-ish hit only every few minutes. Still, with those measures currently in place, the CPU load issue has gone away and the queries per second is generally down in the double digits on average.</p>
<p>The true sign that everything is working, though, was the lack of an email in my inbox this afternoon.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Riiiiccoollaaa--aa--aa----a------</h2><time>June 4, 2015</time><div><p>Hey, there. It&#39;s been quite some time. About two months, I&#39;d reckon. Actually, I&#39;m not even sure that last post counts for much, being that it was entirely technical. The one before it doesn&#39;t count either, as it was more of an op-ed piece... I guess? I dunno...</p>
<p>So, what exactly has Matt Hackmann been up to since his last meaningful &quot;life update&quot;? Who wants to know? Certainly, you don&#39;t. But, the future me does, so that&#39;s enough to validate my want to write this post. The answer to the original question is fairly simple: not a lot. And also, everything. Maybe it&#39;s not so simple after all.</p>
<p>The easy answer, really, is work. NDA prevents me from mentioning what exactly is going on, but it&#39;s pretty big. Now that I&#39;m a team lead, I&#39;m being challenged in ways that are completely new and foreign to me. Adding to that, I&#39;ve spent the last month or so on a pretty large portion of this project that affects everybody working on this codebase. All of that landed on Monday and since then, I&#39;ve been helping people on-board while also crushing any bugs that crop up. I still have a long way to go until all that is all tied up with a neat little bow, but this is probably the most difficult and certainly the most crucial time in the life cycle. I&#39;m hoping to be able to breathe a little bit once this part is done.</p>
<p>In the now, very little happens outside of work. I spend most of my evenings and weekends just trying to mentally recuperate, which primarily consists of naps and lazing around. However, this is coming off of a fair amount of things that happened in the last few months.</p>
<p>Back in March, I moved from my little apartment in Sunnyvale to a slightly less little apartment in San Mateo. The apartment itself is pretty sweet and the location is even better. There are so many places that are now in walking distance, from ramen shops to the train station to friends houses. Due to the above exhaustion, I haven&#39;t taken as much advantage of this as I should, but once things ease up, I hope to start sampling some more of the food wares in the area. Inside my apartment, I built a couple of sweet desks to fill the larger space in my room, so I now have a space for computer things and a space for electronics things.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YWUQqEZ.jpg" alt="" title="SO MUCH DESK ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES"></p>
<p>In April, I made another pilgrimage to Japan, this time accompanied by a couple of friends from work. In some regards, I consider this trip to have been more successful than the previous one. I knew better what was going on, and had far, far less fast/conbini food than last time. We also managed to land right in the middle of cherry blossom season which was goddamned gorgeous. Of course, there was plenty of time spent in Akihabara and I came away with many nerdy goods to fill my shelves and to gift to folks. It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s already been almost two months since I&#39;ve been back... or that I even went at all.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s a bunch of stuff. I&#39;m actually feeling motivated to work on my LED board project right now, so I guess I&#39;ll do that.</p>
<p>Or I&#39;ll binge watch a bunch of Forensic Files &gt;_&gt;</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Fun with Load Balancers and Running on Lean Disk Space</h2><time>March 29, 2015</time><div><p>A while back, I spun up a new server and threw a load balancer on top of it and my existing server. The primary reason at the time was to allow cdn.awwni.me to continue to run while Linode performed some mandatory maintenance on the original server (we&#39;ll call it &quot;Chitoge&quot;). The size of that directory at the time was somewhere around 100GB; my new server (we&#39;ll call that one &quot;Taiga&quot;) has something like 20GB of total space. Obviously, I couldn&#39;t clone from Chitoge to Taiga, so I got a little clever. Using some fun around the hosts file, the nginx site config, and a small <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/rbcdn">PHP script</a>, when a file can&#39;t be found locally, it&#39;d be retrieved from the Amazon S3 store I use as long term backup. S3 is slow, though, so I later changed it to pull directly from Chitoge. This helped both with speed and didn&#39;t count against traffic since internal network traffic is free. In a bout of laziness, instead of opening a connection to that server via IP and hand massaging the &#39;Host&#39; header of the request (or mounting some sort of file share), I just host overrode cdn.awwni.me on Taiga to point to Chitoge. Everything worked great.</p>
<p>Last night, knowing that I was soon to exhaust space on Chitoge (a thing that has happened on more than one occasion), I decided to convert it over to the same setup as Taiga. This would allow me to kill dozens of gigabytes of locally stored images and extend the life of my server plan at least a couple of years. Knowing that I was now deleting Taiga&#39;s source of truth image store, I changed up the script to check from a pool of servers; first try a local server, then if that fails, go to AWS. That worked fine and, while I was setting this script up on Chitoge, I decided that it should check against Taiga just in case it had a copy before wasting time downloading from AWS.</p>
<p>I got everything set up and started deleting old image files. Everything seemed fine, so I let the deleting continue and went to bed.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I was greeted by many messages in my reddit inbox saying that images were experiencing 50x errors. My initial thought was that I was saturating the CPU/connection with that long running process, so I killed it. I was unable to repro any errors, so I went on my merry way... until somebody new complained. Well, fuck...</p>
<p>To make a long story short, because I had pointed each server to each other, I was creating an infinite network loop whenever an non-local image was requesting. Here it is in traffic logs:</p>
<p>[User Request -&gt; Taiga] GET /the_image.jpg
Doesn&#39;t exist locally. Retrieving from first server in pool: <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/the_image.jpg">http://cdn.awwni.me/the_image.jpg</a> (Forced pointing to Chitoge)
[Taiga -&gt; Chitoge] GET /the_image.jpg
Doesn&#39;t exist locally. Retrieving from first server in pool: <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/the_image.jpg">http://cdn.awwni.me/the_image.jpg</a> (Forced pointing to Taiga)
[Chitoge -&gt; Taiga] GET /the_image.jpg
Doesn&#39;t exist locally. Retrieving from first server in pool: <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/the_image.jpg">http://cdn.awwni.me/the_image.jpg</a></p>
<p>So, basically that until the scripts start timing out. Now, in a normal infinite loop, you kill your own process but, generally, should be safe from affecting others. However, here, every time there&#39;s a new request, that&#39;s potentially a new instance of PHP being spun up because the other instances are deadlocked waiting for data. So, eventually, the entire chain collapses and you start getting orangereds in your reddit inbox.</p>
<p>In the end, I still have Taiga sourcing from Chitoge since all image uploads go directly there and, generally, Chitoge will have a copy of the file. Chitoge will always take the AWS hit when a file doesn&#39;t exist to avoid this loop scenario. There are many ways I could avoid this scenario entirely, but for now, this set up is getting the job done.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Stoned - My Experiences With Marijuana</h2><time>March 22, 2015</time><div><p>I also considered naming this “The Post My Mother Doesn’t Want to Read”, but that’d be about when I killed that kid in kindergarten. Maybe some other day…</p>
<p>Growing up in a highly conservative Catholic family, it was ingrained into me from an early age that drugs are bad, m’kay. Anybody using or trying to give you these substances were people you generally wanted to avoid. As an interesting aside, alcohol consumers were not subject to the same stigma. But, be that as it was, I carried on through most of my life with a contempt for such things. This feeling didn’t waver, even as I prepared to move to California and the joke running rampant was “huhhuhhuh, you gonna get your weed card?”.</p>
<p>I’m not sure exactly when that sentiment began to change. Through peripheral consumption of various research papers that were being published about the effects of THC on the human body, I knew that marijuana was, in general, less harmful than most recreational drugs and even alcohol. That probably softened the attitude towards the drug itself, but did little to change my view of the consumers and culture built around it. Adding to that, my only knowledge of consumption methods was via burning the leaf. “Less harmful” be damned if you’re still pumping your lungs full of carcinogens.</p>
<p>My perception of the drug and its effect on consumers probably actually changed at about the same time. I began to find out that a lot of the people I held in high regard were consumers, people I never would have suspected were it not pointed out to me. There was, of course, a lot of cognitive dissonance upon hearing this because, in my world view, if you smoke marijuana, you become a couch-bound bum who just smokes and says “duuuuude” a lot. In that same conversation, “edibles” were mentioned, and not the home baked weed brownies. Chocolate bars made by companies who had to adhere to the standards of a government body in order to sell their wares through legal venue.</p>
<p>That, I think, was the tipping point. THC could be made available to me in a form that was easily consumed and easily metered. And so, about a year ago, I tried a very small bit of marijuana laced chocolate just to test the waters. The outcome? Well, I was having trouble determining that through the more immediate feeling of being tipsy that evening. In retrospect, the profound tiredness I felt a couple hours later was the effect of the chocolate.</p>
<p>With the gates having been opened, and at the time thinking I had not felt the effects, I allowed myself a little more experimentation. Of course, this had some upper limits. Absolutely no inhalation of burned weed; being that I have asthma, this would not be good. Also, see above about carcinogens. Really, that left me with a couple of options: try a larger dose of edibles or vaping. And I tried both, with differing effects. Edibles took a very long time to set in and lingered for hours. Vaping was much faster to feel the effects, but shorter lived. I decided that if I wanted to continue using marijuana, these would be the two vehicles of delivery.</p>
<p>In May of last year, I decided to get my card. Or, in my case, I opted to not buy the card and just got the paper. This entailed a visit to a doctor (I want to put quotes, but she was a licensed M.D.) with complaints of some ailment. I said something about migraines, my mother used to have them, had tried herbal something or others, blah and etc. Doctor didn’t blink an eye (she knew I was lying) and, after signing the paper, we spent more time discussing her grandfather who used to live in Bartlesville and had died recently than any topic for why I was there. It was an odd experience for sure.</p>
<p>Thus, through the last year, I’ve been a fairly light user of the product. I eventually gave up on edibles because it basically destroys an entire day. Also, I was beginning to experience bad indigestion, the culmination of which involved me throwing up on a train about a mile from my stop. Of course, that could have also been the dozen-ish drinks I had that night (it was a good birthday). There have been times when I’ve gone without, both due to circumstances or intentional “quitting”. The “quitting” was because I believed that the vape pen I was using was causing the back of my throat to become and stay raw due to heat. I stopped and it went away, so there’s a high potential for correlation (to be fair, that particular pen was later removed from the market). Marijuana is a non-addictive drug, so I never feel like I <em>need</em> it. However, like anything, one can become psychologically addicted to the high itself. I’d be remiss if I said there wasn’t a little bit of that going on.</p>
<p>Today, I treat marijuana in basically the same way I treat alcohol. If I’m to use it, driving and most outside activities are banned. Unlike alcohol, I will use it by myself outside of social situations, but generally only before bed as it helps calm my mind for sleep.</p>
<p>Going forward, I’ve already decided not to renew my card this year. There are a few reasons, the first of which is that I don’t want to have to make another “doctor visit”. Secondly, it’s obviously cheaper to drop this. Granted, because I’m such a light user, the cost of a year’s worth of marijuana is still less than a handful of average nights of bar hopping. I will probably continue to partake in social settings, but I do not feel the need to have it on my person or in my home.</p>
<p>The takeaway from all this is that there are a lot misconceptions and old feelings about marijuana and its users. Becoming stoned will probably not turn a person into a stereotypical stoner unless that person was already susceptible to such things, as can be expected with almost anything. I still don’t like the culture, nor do I like the smell, but I think if one wants to argue about the negatives of using marijuana, one should also consider alcohol and cigarettes, both of which are (mostly) socially acceptable, legal, and much worse for a person’s physical well-being.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>One good turn</h2><time>February 14, 2015</time><div><p>In my previous post, I mentioned the little &quot;micro list&quot; thing my mom is currently doing on her blog. Among these was a <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2015/02/february-five-favorites-edition/">favorites list</a>. Noticing that she had added a row for video games, I snarkily suggested she should have &quot;favorite TNG character&quot;. To her credit, she devoted the <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2015/02/february-five-12/">entire next post</a> to the topic of Next Generation. It&#39;s moments like these when I consciously consider the fact that my mom has a bit of a nerdy streak which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>But, enough of that, given that she went through the trouble of constructing that list, I feel it&#39;s only right that I do the same. So, following her parameters, here is mine:</p>
<p><strong>1. Favorite Character</strong> - Gonna have to go with Picard on this one. How can you not respect the guy who is essentially a role model for humanity? Following closely behind would be Q, Data, and Riker (in no particular order).</p>
<p><strong>2. Favorite Episode</strong> - Much to my mom&#39;s chagrin, I can&#39;t not give this award to <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_%28episode%29">Cause and Effect</a>. I believe it&#39;s been mentioned before, but I love time travel stories and time loops in particular are a guilty pleasure of mine. On a funny aside, the first Google result for &quot;enterprise keeps exploding&quot; is the Wiki entry for this episode.</p>
<p><strong>3. Least Favorite Character</strong> - You thought I was going to say Pulaski, didn&#39;t you mother? Well, despite the fact that I cannot stand her elitist attitude and the way she treats data, she&#39;s only number two in that regard. No, this coveted award goes to Tasha Yar, the overly emotional, too bull-headed security officer that preceded Worf. Her death is one of the shining moments of the series.</p>
<p><strong>4. Favorite Doctor</strong> - I don&#39;t have much to say about Lwaxana Troi (though, I do enjoy the episodes she&#39;s in), but I do have words for the various doctors in the series, my favorite being (drumroll) the Doctor! Sure, the actual TV series only had Pulaski and Crusher (of two, I prefer the latter), but the good ol&#39; EMH makes a wonderful yet brief appearance in First Contact making him eligible for this list. You can&#39;t not love his dickish, self-serving attitude and, as a main character on Voyager, was given much more time to be fleshed out as a character.</p>
<p><strong>5. On the topic of Q</strong> - Who doesn&#39;t love Q? He&#39;s such an asshole, but a highly entertaining one (see above about the Doctor). Q episodes always tend to bring out the more interesting topics, such as &quot;how would you relive your life given the chance&quot;? He also introduced the Borg, which is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Okay, I have geeked out about Trek for long enough. I should run to the store to pick up ingredients for turkey soup. Should be a hoppin&#39; good time.</p>

And what efforts those were. Actually, I think 2014 might be my most active year ever. Just going by GitHub, I totaled over 670 commits. Of course, that doesn&#39;t include anything I did at work (and there was certainly a lot of that). So what exactly happened last year?</p>
<h2 id="redditbooru-v2">RedditBooru v2</h2>
<p>This is <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/systems-architecture-in-the-unknown/">pretty</a> well <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/redditbooru-v2-postmortem/">documented</a>. January was spent rewriting basically everything as I attempted to port RedditBooru to nodejs. Then, when that didn&#39;t pan out how I wanted, went back to the original PHP stack with major modifications to the existing codebase. The new feature set in v2 wasn&#39;t the huge success I expected it to be (though, my bandwidth nearly doubled overnight). Indeed, views have been steadily dropping, though I think this is partially due to better RES integration that came along. Still, 875k page views by 214k unique users is pretty good and more than I would have anticipated anything I&#39;d ever create would do. But, that doesn&#39;t even begin to compare to...</p>
<h2 id="anime-bracket">Anime Bracket</h2>
<p>Some interesting stuff happened here (that is actually pending a full write up). In August, a user on the anime subreddit contacted me about using the awwnime bracket site for a bracket he wanted to do. I said yes, pulled some code strings, and let him on his merry way. Long story short, that bracket garnered over 1 million page views and 2.5 million votes by 24k registered users. Here&#39;s a fun little image showing the difference between that bracket and the one I usually run in the fall:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jnda7fE.jpg" alt="" title="That tall peak is 45k users in one day"></p>
<p>That kickstarted an effort by me to make the bracket accessible to anybody (because it has also proved to be financially sustainable). Indeed, as I write this, I&#39;m taking a break from <a href="http://beta.brakk.it/">working on the new site</a>. But, more details on that later.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>As usual, those two projects continue to be my main concern while not at work. However, that&#39;s not all I&#39;ve done. There was the aforementioned contributions to RES updating support for RedditBooru albums. There was also the work I did on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoghOn8Abs8">awwnime bracket app</a>. I also did some work around my <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/HueHueHueNET/tree/master/HueController">Hue lights</a> and a couple of other <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/HedonismSlackBot">trifling</a> <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/ScreensAgainstHumanity">things</a> that didn&#39;t gain traction. Of course, that&#39;s not including the stuff that I don&#39;t commit (and I do a lot of small scripts just to help out with day-to-day life).</p>
<p>Alright, so there&#39;s another post.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>2014 Micro Retrospectives - Intro + Bikes</h2><time>December 30, 2014</time><div><p>2014 is winding down as the shadow of 2015 looms over us. I don&#39;t even know why we give this any mind; time is but a human construct and the &quot;new year&quot; marker could have been placed at any point. Indeed, other cultures have their own ways of keeping time with their own &quot;new years&quot;. Interesting that the concept of a &quot;year&quot;, a larger span of time filled with many smaller demarcations of time, is seen in most of these calendar systems. Still, I&#39;m happy to use an arbitrary position on our planet&#39;s orbit to define the changing of the year. Whatever, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here to talk about.</p>
<p>For myself, 2014 was arguably less exciting than 2013. No sudden life changes, no international trips, just a fairly standard year. Still, it wasn&#39;t without its own interesting things and I&#39;ll now take a look back at the more notable things that happened in a series of very short blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
<p>I&#39;d purchased a bike in 2013, shortly after returning from Japan (partially because my original bike had been stolen while I was gone). Despite having it, I didn&#39;t make use of it nearly as much as I should have. But, this year, I began going on long rides with friends which really makes the whole experience much more appealing. On top of that, I bought a <a href="http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/elite-road/caad8/caad8-6-tiagra">very nice bike</a> and, as I became more accustomed to it, started upgrading that with nice upgrades like better wheels and clips. All said and done, I logged over 1800 miles this year which is an accomplishment I&#39;m quite proud of.</p>
<p>That&#39;s today, tomorrow might be more!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Letters from the Past</h2><time>December 21, 2014</time><div><p>Shortly after writing <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-of-future-past/">this post last year</a>, I sent my future self (me now) another email with my hopes and predictions for the future. Today I have received that email:</p>
<p>[quote]Dear FutureMe,</p>
<p>Hello from the past! I feel a little strange writing this letter considering how WRONG I was on the previous one. But, here we are.</p>
<p>Looking at 2014 from my vantage point, there shouldn&#39;t be much change from the latter half of 2013; you&#39;ll still be at LinkedIn and, of course, in the Bay Area. I&#39;m hoping that you&#39;ll have become slightly more suave with the ladies because that&#39;s really the last item on the checklist.</p>
<p>Also, there&#39;s the very vague possibility of an Oktoberfest trip with the ol&#39; TN folks. At this point in time, I&#39;m not sure how that will play out or if it will and it wasn&#39;t just a bunch of &quot;Whooo!! Riding the high of life&quot; type talk.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;m hoping that summer with Chris hanging out while he interns winds up being every bit as awesome as I&#39;m anticipating right now.</p>
<p>So, get your ass a girlfriend and I&#39;ll see you in a year![/quote]</p>
<p>All in all, that summed up the year pretty accurately. I&#39;m still at LI, still in the bay, and Chris&#39; internship was a lot of fun. Of course, the Oktoberfest trip didn&#39;t happen, but I did wind up visiting all of those folks in their new home of Smogsville, TX just last weekend.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a recurring theme here in the form of &quot;get a girlfriend you big ass&quot;. And, as I prepare to write the letter to myself for next year, that thing will come up yet again. Of course, actually trying to meet somebody would probably be a huge step towards actually realizing this. Having a handful of dates with one girl per year isn&#39;t getting me anywhere very quickly...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>102.2</h2><time>September 17, 2014</time><div><p>So, I&#39;ve fallen off the horse on that daily blogging shit. Whatevs. Not much has been happening that&#39;s worth talking about or that I can talk about (NDA and all). Until today, that is.</p>
<p>When I woke up terribly sick.</p>
<p>Normally, I know when I&#39;m getting sick the night before, but not this time. I woke this morning and started thinking that something didn&#39;t feel right. Snooze the alarm, attempt to sleep for another nine minutes. But I don&#39;t as I&#39;m assessing the situation. Then it hits me: I feel sick. Well, that&#39;s not right. I get sick the night before; I should have known this is coming. My body, however, apparently had other plans. Alarm goes off again and I&#39;m lying there deciding if I should go to work where we&#39;re currently in crunch time or stay home. I decide the latter and text the boss my physical and work status. I throw my phone on the floor and attempt to get rest.</p>
<p>But the weight of deadlines prevents me from getting much actual rest. I have a weird fever dream where I&#39;m on a date eating hotdog ice cream. Well, kind of. It&#39;s actually a hotdog in an ice cream cone with a cone of chocolate on top. My date throws her cone on the ground and then proceeds to steal food from a good truck. I&#39;m flabbergasted and am about to tell her off when I realize... this can&#39;t be real. Sure enough, it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>So, I get up, drink some juice and pop out the work laptop. After about an hour-ish of work, my body feels like it&#39;s actually going to start falling apart at the seams. So, I abandon work and crash on the couch figuring now would be a perfect time to catch up on the animus that I&#39;ve not been watching lately. One episode each of Girls&#39; Monthly Nozaki-kun, Hanayamata, and Sword Art Online later, I decide I should try to get some more work done. But, the 12 foot journey from my couch to my computer makes me realize that my health has actually declined in the time since I&#39;d last been over there. I IM the boss my status and that this is the end of me, grab abother Advil and OJ, then head back to the couch.</p>
<p>Where I proceed to watch ten more episodes of Sword Art.</p>
<p>The show isn&#39;t bad, certainly better than the second half of season 1. However, I can&#39;t help but notice that Kirito is coming to rescue yet another damsel in PTSD distress. Fuck having strong female protagonists in that show; I just don&#39;t think the author has it in him to keep his initially strong females that way. Also, there are so many ass and taint shots of the main female character. Which is okay, I guess...</p>
<p>But, this isn&#39;t about SAO, it&#39;s about me being sick. As I&#39;m watching all these episodes, I&#39;m toying with the idea of getting a pizza. And get a pizza I do. It arrives ~40 minutes later and I chow down as I finish watching SAO. The pizza makes me feel a bit better, having filled the void in my stomach. And then sleepy.</p>
<p>I crawl into my bed where I try to get cool enough to fall asleep. It must have been successful, because the next thing I know the sun has gone down and the clock reads five hours later. I finish up the orange juice (which I am now sadly missing) and lie down on the the couch where I&#39;ve basically ever since, power watching Fairly Odd Parents and Hey, Arnold!. At some point during that mess, I remembered that I have a thermometer. Curious, I take my temperature.</p>
<p>100.4</p>
<p>Well, that seems a bit high. I&#39;ve been taking my temp a few times since, coming up with everything from 100 to 102.2. If I wasn&#39;t sure before, there&#39;s solid numerical evidence that I am pretty goddamn sick.</p>
<p>I wonder what tomorrow will bring...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Those Damn Backgrounds</h2><time>September 9, 2014</time><div><p>As I was talking about yesterday, today I gave the card pattern a shot with regards to the past bracket page. As for the cards themselves, I&#39;m really pleased.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ObP2RYl.jpg" alt="" title="The CARDinal rule is..."></p>
<p>However, the background leaves a lot to be desired. Putting it against a solid color loses the energy that I&#39;ve got going to the landing page and, in the end, just looks empty. There&#39;s not enough content here to fill up all that empty space. So, I tried playing around with the layout some.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mJgeC00.jpg" alt="" title="FLIP"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Cnw0N6Z.jpg" alt="" title="CONTENT FLIP"></p>
<p>Not really satisfied with any of those. Perhaps I should take a photo that has less going on, something that could be centered more. Or perhaps I rework the cards themselves to fill more space on the page.</p>
<p>I dunno, back to pushing pixels.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Designing with Materials</h2><time>September 8, 2014</time><div><p>So, I found my bike pump. Turns out I stashed it in the back of my car at some point. Probably that time I drove down to San Mateo to bike into work (as I&#39;ll be doing very early tomorrow morning).</p>
<p>As I begin spinning up the ol&#39; design gears readying myself for the inevitable yearly update to the bracket, I was scanning the docs for Google&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material specs</a>. Interesting stuff, for sure, and an aesthetic I really like. That in mind, I attempted reworking the bracket selection page somewhat in this style. Failed miserably, but it was an interesting night of exploration.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KFmaoyY.jpg" alt="" title="Bleh"></p>
<p>The thought of a full screen selection page was kind of nice for about the first 30 minutes, but has since lost its appeal. Also, finding the right kind of imagery to pull that off would be difficult. On top of all that, not really pleased with the typography.</p>
<p>I think the better patter to use in this case would be a <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html#cards-actions">card</a>. This will scale better with more brackets, will be easily transferrable to the <em>other</em> bracket site that&#39;s been spin from all of this, and also easily made for mobile devices. We&#39;ll see how that one goes.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>And I would bike 500 miles</h2><time>September 7, 2014</time><div><p>But I wouldn&#39;t bike 500 more. At least, not within the span of a month.</p>
<p>This morning, as a friend and I were biking our disappointment of not biking away, he made a comment about attempting to hit 500 miles by the end of the month. Though I grunted an agreement, my thoughts were skeptical. However, as I was biking this evening, attempting to bring my total milage for the week above my goal of 50, I considered how I might go about this without killing myself.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it wouldn&#39;t be all bad.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider that today is the 7th and that I have 23 more days with which to achieve my goal. I&#39;ve already biked 51.7 miles, so that leaves <em>only</em> 448.3 miles to go. Let&#39;s crack out some math:</p>
<p><strong>448.3 / 23 = ~19.5 miles per day</strong></p>
<p>Might seem high, but actually quite attainable. Let&#39;s break it down piece by piece.</p>
<p>Five days a week, I can bike to work from home. It&#39;s about 6.3 miles in each direction, so that&#39;d be 12.6 miles. Lately, I&#39;ve been enjoying doing an end-to-end-and-back-again ride on my street, which is just shy of ten miles even. So, on any given work day, I could bike 22.5 miles. With 17 work days left in the month, that would be:</p>
<p><strong>22.5 * 17 = 382.5</strong></p>
<p>Now to figure out the other 65.8 miles.</p>
<p>One way to do this would to simply continue my ten mile evening ride on the weekends. There are six weekend days left in the month, so that&#39;d be 60 miles. Of course, there&#39;s no reason why I couldn&#39;t do something a little longer, such as a bike to San Jose and back. On average, these run about 20 miles, so trade out one ten mile ride for that and I&#39;m already there.</p>
<p>But, let&#39;s assume I don&#39;t want to bike <em>every</em> day. Let&#39;s also assume that I&#39;ll be doing some riding from San Mateo (because I most certainly will).</p>
<p>The ride from San Mateo to Mountain View is on the order of 25.5 miles. Were I to do just one of those per week (let&#39;s assume Tuesdays), I could get four of those in. Here&#39;s the new workday break down:</p>
<p><strong>13 <em> 12.6 + 4 </em> 25.5 + 4 <em> 6.3 + 17 </em> 10 = 461</strong></p>
<p>So, that&#39;s 13 days of biking to and from home and work, four days of San Mateo -&gt; work -&gt; home, and then doing that short ten mile ride every evening. Suddenly, my weekends are free to collapse onto the couch and do nothing :D. Now, let&#39;s see how many calories this would burn (using some quickly head-calculated averages):</p>
<p><strong>13 <em> 500 + 4 </em> 850 + 4 <em> 250 + 17 </em> 300 = 16,000 calories</strong></p>
<p>So, basically 16 Taco Bell box meals if I don&#39;t drink soda. But, in actuality, I could eat more.</p>
<p>Because just living also burns calories...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Lazy Approach to Design</h2><time>September 5, 2014</time><div><p>It&#39;s getting to be that time of year again when I begin making preparations for the annual awwnime bracket. Unlike last year, where I split the bracket up into <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2013-anime-boys-bracket-a-postmortem/">boys</a> and <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-anime-bracket-my-other-fulltime-job/">girls</a>, I&#39;m going to head off any &quot;well, this character identifies as...&quot; issues off at the pass and go back to a single bracket. And with the new bracket comes yet another tweaking of the design.</p>
<p>Last year, I requested custom artwork of 2012&#39;s bracket winner from a <a href="http://anartistapprentice.deviantart.com/">fledgling artist</a> who was active in /r/awwnime. I placed his pieces on the site, mostly working around the existing design. This year I wanted to do something different, partly because I really am coming to loath that design, partly because I want to try something new. That something is mostly eschewing the much pixel pushing and heavily using photography and typography to create the interface.</p>
<p>Carrying on the trend of having the previous year&#39;s winner &quot;emcee&quot; the current year&#39;s bracket, I picked up a Nedoroid of said winner as the center piece for the design. Nendoroids, for those who have lives, are a chibi style line of figurines that are fully posable and come with a variety of different accessories and faces, allowing you to make many combinations of expressions. Generally, this is not my type of thing being more of the &quot;static&quot; figure type of guy, but for creating a photo based site design, it&#39;s quite perfect.</p>
<p>Now, I won&#39;t lie. The decision to go with this type of aesthetic was for the look, the other part was because I felt it was going to be simpler to pull off. Which is probably true, if you know how to correctly operate your camera, light your scene, and orchestrate things compositionally. I, sadly, did not know how to do these things very well. As such, this was my first result:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j4CFpYd.jpg" alt="" title="omm nom nom"></p>
<p>First thing&#39;s first, the positioning of the little Tsukiko is way off, gobbling up (pun intended) too much of the center stage, leaving disgusting areas on the side that are trying to be hidden by some falloff gradients. Also, despite my best efforts to color correct the initial image, it still kind of has a urine stained feel to it (much like K-mart). Despite using the same post-processing, the iPhone landing screen was far and away better, if not color wise, certainly compositionally.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/e4UulL3.png" alt="" title="Peek a boo"></p>
<p>Actually, that peeking above the fold arrangement is what I used for all of the app branding, from App Store images to icon. I quite like it.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with the original desktop splash screen and wanting to get the thing coded soon, I gave it another go. I happened to have some banana muffins sitting in the freezer, so I thought that might make a better set piece than the random not-identifiable-as-curry-box in the background. After switching the camera into full manual mode and playing around with poses and lighting, I arrived at this result:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T0EDJsZ.jpg" alt="" title="For me?"></p>
<p>Holy shit, that&#39;s so much better! So much better in fact, that almost all post processing was removed in Photoshop leaving only some slight tweaks to the color curves to bring the blues up a bit. Of course, this is but one of at least three screens that I have to do, the remaining two being the nomination and voting screens. Not sure what I&#39;ll do for those at this point, but at least I&#39;m getting a feel for the camera and how these photos need to be taken to work well within a web layout.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>That&#x27;ll End Your Fun Real Quickly</h2><time>September 4, 2014</time><div><p>Deciding that my Taco Bell supper was too much to weigh on my conscience, I decided that a late night bike ride was the thing to do. This after dark guilt ride is something that happens entirely too frequently. But, that&#39;s beside the point.</p>
<p>Before I even get out the door, I was looking for my pump to top my tires off. How something that large can go completely missing is beyond me, but after a solid 10-15 minutes of looking, it was nowhere to be found. So, I decided to just live with the pressure at whatever it was and go. Get outside, start Strava and my music, hop on the saddle, clip in, and away I go... except I don&#39;t. As I&#39;m rounding the corner towards the apartment exit, I realize I&#39;m not wearing my helmet. Return home, grab helmet, rinse and repeat. I&#39;m finally on the road.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m out biking, listening to some tunes and giving my new bike undies a test run. My outfit is said undies, a pair of gym shorts, and my Lockheed-Martin jersey (it has pockets which is handy for holding my hand pump). My ass was comfortable for sure, though there&#39;s not enough padding in the crotch. Probably too much information, but there it is.</p>
<p>Again, I&#39;m out biking and not really taking any particular direction. Up over a bridge, under an overpass, around Fry&#39;s and to a side road that takes me past the rock climbing place. This drops me out on a road that goes by the Sunnyvale LinkedIn complex. Had I brought my badge, I could have stopped in and raided the pantry, but I didn&#39;t so I didn&#39;t. As I&#39;m making a left out of that building and onto the road, I hear a loud &quot;pop&quot; behind me. I didn&#39;t need to inspect the bike to know what had happened; I&#39;d been struck by the Curse of Jibjab.</p>
<p>One of my coworkers (well, technically two) have the same bike that I do. He blew a spoke on that bike not once, but twice, on the same wheel even. I pulled myself over to the sidewalk, flipped my bike over and began inspecting every spoke on the wheel. Lo and behold, a spoke has been sheared off.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xvn3qf1.jpg" alt="" title="That shit ain&#39;t right"></p>
<p>At this point, I&#39;m somewhere on the order of 2-3 miles away from home. I briefly consider my options and decide that, despite the fact that wheel won&#39;t even spin freely anymore, it&#39;s good enough under load to make it home. I wasn&#39;t really keen to the idea of walking that far back in my biking shoes.</p>
<p>So, I slow rode all the way back, worrying the entire time that my immense weight was going to crush the rest of the spokes. Luckily, it went by without incident. I suppose all in all this isn&#39;t such a bad ordeal as I was planning on replacing the wheels with something better anyways, but I don&#39;t really like being forced into these situations.</p>
<p>Fate, however, has its own plans.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Old Dogs Can Learn New Tricks, It Just Takes Longer</h2><time>September 3, 2014</time><div><p>As I sit here whiling away the time trying to put the finishing touches on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoghOn8Abs8">Awwnime Bracket app</a>, I realize that the infernal clock ticks away at the minutes, much as it always does. Of course, not that any of this matters since my server is still running in Central time and the dates will be messed up anyways.</p>
<p>As stated, I sit here coding in that which I have tried several times before: writing apps for iPhone using the abominations that are Objective-C and Xcode. Now, this isn&#39;t my first time in this rodeo. Indeed, in 2012 or 2013 (before LinkedIn was a thing I considered a thing), I purchased a Mac mini in hopes of carving myself a space in the ever expanding &quot;app-o-sphere&quot; and some of those tantalizing dollars that could come with. I did my damnedest to follow learn Obj-C and tried to follow the Stanford iTunes U course, but it was just too much all at once for my brain to process. I quickly got discouraged and gave up. Shortly after the move to California (or perhaps slightly before), I sold the mini and forgot all about that shit.</p>
<p>Then, mid-last year, one of my fellow webdevs at work organized a weekly session in which we would all meet for an afternoon and learn ourselves some iOS development. This arguably went much better, though my mind still had trouble wrapping itself around all those fucking square brackets and the hierarchy of views and view controllers and what have you. Despite being one of the handful that &quot;graduated&quot; that class, I barely pounded out a semi-functional app. Seriously, that thing was (and is) a piece of shit. It was supposed to be an &quot;offline&quot; client for the music page, but never quite made it entirely to that offline mode. I still would like to complete it so I can track my music listenings while biking or driving.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few months ago. I don&#39;t recall how it came around, but as LinkedIn&#39;s membership continues its drive towards mobile devices, so too are we trying to scrounge up mobile support internally. One thing lead to another and my name hit a list of people that they wanted trained in iOS. I accepted (perhaps a little begrudgingly), and for one week in August, did nothing but iOS training. Perhaps it was all the repetition, but something about that class made everything stick. Perhaps it&#39;s because we were writing actual apps that did actual things and each of those exercises themselves had much repetition. But, when I came out of that class, it was as if the clouds had lifted and the chorus sang out from the heavens. I&#39;d finally grasped these ever elusive concepts that had me so worked up in the months and years prior.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m an amazing iOS developer. Far from it. However, I&#39;ve been putzing away at this bracket app with relative ease, only looking up particular things for particular cases when needed. It&#39;s odd to see how even the way I&#39;ve been writing javascript has changed in only the last few weeks. I find myself using Obj-C/Foundation style nomenclature when writing methods (initWithXYAndZ).</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s that. I was hoping to get this app submitted tonight, but I just profiled the thing and it&#39;s eating up a healthy 500MB+ (all in images), so I need to figure out how to mitigate that.</p>
<p>I do love doing this shit...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>What&#x27;s in a Nap?</h2><time>September 2, 2014</time><div><p>The clock says 9:55pm and I have, more or less, just awoken from an evening nap... that lasted two hours. I make no secret of the amount of time I spend napping, but generally it&#39;s 20-30 minutes. Two hours is excessive and it&#39;s now eaten away at time that I was going to spend working on my bracket app.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure why I&#39;m so prone to napping. The most obvious thing to me would be the fact that I keep such terrible hours. My alarm begins going off at 6:20am so I can snooze it a couple of times before rolling into work not too long after 7am. My final sleep generally begins around 12am-1am, which leaves five to six hours for actual sleep. The nap could exist as a little pick me up to make it just a bit farther.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also theorized that my job could be part of the reason. Dealing with office work and software development is more taxing than one might think for something that keeps you immobile for nearly 9 hours. Given that my brain has been running at high capacity for that time, once I return home, everything just grinds to a halt. I flop on the couch, flick on the TV, and basically do nothing for the remained of the evening. That is, unless I have some sort of deadline to meet in a project I&#39;m working on.</p>
<p>My final thoughts concerning the naps, somewhat related to the above, is that I may be suffering from mild depression. When I&#39;m at home, lying in my bed, it sometimes takes quite a feat to do anything. I don&#39;t feel like playing a video game, or reading a book, or watching TV, or any numerous things that require nearly zero physical or cognitive effort. Hell, sometimes it&#39;s so bad I&#39;ll even let my stomach go hungry because I don&#39;t want to move to make food. Instead I&#39;ll just lie in my bed drifting in and out of sleep, going through this same mental cycle as my mind breaches into consciousness. I&#39;m not entirely settled on the depression idea as I&#39;ve seen real depression play out. I&#39;m a pretty content person most of the time, so I think this is more extreme laziness than anything else.</p>
<p>Alright, there&#39;s more words!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Return of the Daily Blog</h2><time>September 1, 2014</time><div><p>As has been a semi-recurring thing for the last couple years, I will be attempting to jot my thoughts down once per day on this little corner of the internet I&#39;ve carved for myself. Not sure what I&#39;ll say at this point, but it may be more serious and brain dumpy than the usual fluff affair. Or it may not be, I dunno.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve barely even said anything over the last few months, so I guess a place to start is by catching up. I feel like my life has taken an interesting turn the last few months. Before moving to California, I was essentially the shining definition of a lone wolf. Wake up, go to work, go home. The only time I socialized with people was during those nine hours in the office. Now, however, I actively spend quite a lot of time (by my standards) away from home and doing things with other people. This evening, for example, I was at a friend&#39;s house rolling characters for an upcoming Dungeons and Dragons game, after which we played <a href="http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/">Munchkin</a>. Pretty standard social fare on paper, but as stated, kind of a big deal for me. Add to this the biking excursions, evenings of drinking, and other random outings with people and I sometimes find myself in that spot of swimming unknown waters and having to figure things out as I go. I hate being in this situation and I know it&#39;s a major reason why I shy away from dating. When I don&#39;t know the rules, everybody winds up having a bad time, or perhaps a great time at the expense of my psyche.</p>
<p>But, whatever. There&#39;s more to say, but I&#39;ll leave this here to leave fodder for the future.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>RedditBooru v2 - Postmortem</h2><time>August 3, 2014</time><div><p>Back in January, I wrote a rather <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/systems-architecture-in-the-unknown/">frustrated post</a> about rewriting RedditBooru on a new tech stack and how everything sucked. Six months (almost to the day) after that post, I finally launched the second major revision of the site. That launch was not without a whole bunch of drama.</p>
<h2 id="codebase-direction">Codebase Direction</h2>
<p>In the aforementioned post, I was originally developing on a stack consisting of nodejs and mongoDB. Shortly after, I abandoned nearly everything I had written, the only thing carried over being the few templates that were done. There were many lessons learned in that excursion, particularly &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t rewrite it&quot;. I decided that instead of again rewriting everything from the ground up, I would work off of the existing codebase and retool that. This proved immediately to be the right idea, as I was able to quickly port many of the new things I&#39;d written in node to PHP but without any of the stability issues. The first of these was the cron job.</p>
<p>The nodejs version of the cron (which was more of a daemon than a cron, really) heavily used async operations which allowed it to index all sources very quickly, generally in a matter of seconds. PHP is by its nature not async friendly, so I employed some clever process management handled by node, something that I&#39;d casually thrown out as an option to resolve my node woes. The node manager keeps a pool of 4 indexer processes running, allowing for multiple sources to be indexed simultaneously in individual hardware threads but with all the benefits of synchronous code for each individual process. This proved to be rock solid right from the start, though did result in high CPU usage as I&#39;d noticed in the first few days after launch. It was enough of an issue that I dropped the maximum number of processes down to one. Turns out I was unnecessarily hammering MySQL for data, and by <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/commit/1e331512f95f7c61b980573f155629c9cd75f66c">being smarter about my DB calls</a>, CPU usage was dropped almost to 0 and I was able to ramp back up to 4 processes while still utilizing less CPU than in the previous single running process.</p>
<p>One major change I did make to the front-end was to use <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone</a> as my JS framework. The primary reason I did this was to familiarize myself with the MV* frameworks that have been all the rage lately and I know the day is coming when I&#39;ll need to know this stuff for work. The other reason was that it provided logical structure to my JS instead of haphazardly throwing everything into a single JS file. The only issues I had with the framework were around it&#39;s handling of routes, a chunk of code I eventually just <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/static/js/dev/controls/Routes.js">wrote myself</a> to suit my particular use cases. All in all, I&#39;m pretty happy with backbone, but I feel that I probably did not use it to its fullest advantage. I probably could&#39;ve gotten away with no framework and using something like <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/Fiber">Fiber</a> to give me a nice, classical style OOP scheme to work off of.</p>
<h2 id="release-day">Release Day</h2>
<p>So, development went pretty smoothly once I kept doing things I knew how to do. And everything was fine... right up until just before the hard date I&#39;d set for release (June 30th, in this case). A couple days before release, I went over my hosting bandwidth cap on the existing server, something that had been threatening to happen for months. I quickly began scrambling to figure how to route traffic to places where I wouldn&#39;t be paying the enormous overage fees I would be getting from my hosting. During all that, I made the decision that I should just spin the new redditbooru up on a new machine, one with much greater bandwidth caps. Many hours of file copying later, I had all of my sites on the new machine with traffic slowly diverting over there... except for redditbooru. Because of how it names hosted files, this would have to be transferred over last. And everything probably would have gone okay... if I hadn&#39;t forgotten one thing. As the traffic was shifting from the old machine to the new machine, there were weird anomalies showing up with pictures people had posted to reddit, namelyt different people were seeing different things for the same file. At this point, it should be mentioned that a user&#39;s DNS could be in one of four states:</p>
<ul>
<li>pointing to CloudFlare (which would be pointing to one of the following)</li>
<li>pointing to AWS</li>
<li>pointing to the old server</li>
<li>pointing to the new server</li>
</ul>
<p>My initial thoughts were that one or two things slipped through before I migrated the database from the old machine to the new machine. I had disabled uploading on the old one, so there shouldn&#39;t be any collisions. Except for the fact that I&#39;d forgotten to also turn off the indexer on the old box. This was causing the two separate machines to constantly overwrite each other&#39;s images on AWS and since their database IDs were very different, those images would be different as well. And, I was powerless to do anything while the DNS was propagating. Of course, the old indexer was shut down which resolved all issues going forward and I overwrote all the bad images on AWS using the new machine as the source of truth, but it was still a waiting game as that DNS finished up so I could turn off the old server.</p>
<p>It was a hellacious couple of days and I&#39;m honestly surprised anybody still trusted my software after that.</p>
<h2 id="one-month-later">One Month Later</h2>
<p>It&#39;s now one month later and things have finally smoothed out. Of course, there are still some issues I&#39;ve been experiencing with the new software and new machine. For instance, all sites on that machine stopped working a week or two ago. Turns out that MariaDB had enabled binary query logging by default and had exhausted all of the available disk space (some 77GB of logs). MongoDB, which I&#39;d relegated to image caching and internal metrics logging, also just fucking died a couple times, bringing all of RB with it. I&#39;ve since disabled mongo and migrated the image caching to a <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/commit/1c15499f6c21d98de695cb571640a2cba6cd210a">simple disk based system</a>. This leaves me in a bit of a bind as many features I had planned were going to use mongo for a denormalized data store (stats type things, mostly). I&#39;m currently looking into redis as a possible way replacing this.</p>
<p>All that said, RedditBooru is healthy now and people are taking advantage of the new features built in, particularly the inline image viewer. That feature is so popular that time-on-site has jumped a full minute and my bandwidth for last month approached 6TB, a full 2TB over what my previous bandwidth cap. This is again going to fast become a major issue, one that needs resolving pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I think overall what I can take away from this whole experience is that calm works makes for higher quality work. Panic only brings additional pain.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are some interesting things I ran across that I&#39;d like to feature sometime. But, that&#39;d be too much effort and I&#39;m more about the self-deprecation.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>To Become the Most Boring Person I Can Be</h2><time>April 5, 2014</time><div><p>This blog has once again fallen into dusty shambles. So, I&#39;m going to kick in another post-a-day type experiment... starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m going to do is keep a daily log for a week, but instead of my usual type rambling, it&#39;ll be just 100% facts, completely devoid of emotion, opinion, or adjectives/adverbs (using as few as possible). A little something like this:</p>
<p>[quote]I woke up at 10:15am this morning. I didn&#39;t actually want to leave my bed, so I fished my iPad out from under my bed and checked my email, Facebook, and reddit. I decided to make German potato salad today but lacked all the ingredients required. After deliberation, I decided I would bike. I geared up, but after getting out the door noticed that my back tire was again low. I put the bike back in my apartment and took the car instead. Since I was no longer worried about distance or the roads I would need to take, I went to Safeway because they have a better selection of food than Target. Once at the store, I purchased potatoes, scallions, bacon, and white wine vinegar. After returning home, I cleaned a large pot to boil the potatoes in. They are currently boiling now.[/quote]</p>
<p>Seems a bit like those old <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-me-of-yore-part-1/">journal entries of mine, no?</a>. For contrast, here&#39;s how I&#39;d rewrite the first couple of sentences.</p>
<p>[quote]Given that I&#39;m only half way into this day, I would label it as almost entirely ordinary. Consciousness began to return to me somewhere around 10:15a, about an hour later than my usual 9a (largely thankful to my late night of playing Danganronpa, no doubt). Despite the lateness, I didn&#39;t feel like leave the warm comforts of my bed, so I grabbed my iPad (generally kept beneath my bed) to entertain myself with. I did a quick check of my email, Facebook, and skimmed reddit. Despite Alien Blue being a pretty nice app, I don&#39;t like to &quot;deep dive&quot; into my usual subreddits on a mobile device because I feel the experience would be diminished on a small screen (moe must be observed with as many pixels as possible).[/quote]</p>
<p>So, yeah. That&#39;s a thing I&#39;m going to do because I&#39;m otherwise bored and have little to write about (or am not willing to expend the effort in doing so).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Head Sensations</h2><time>March 20, 2014</time><div><p>I&#39;d been considering writing a blog post on this subject for some time, but balked because it seemed an odd thing to talk about. But, after the topic came up at lunch not long ago, I figured why not. Besides, I need to post something this month as I&#39;ve not missed posting at least one thing per month since August 2010. Gotta keep the streak alive.</p>
<p>The aforementioned topic is a physical sensation that&#39;s been dubbed on the internet as &quot;ASMR&quot;, or &quot;autonomous sensory meridian response&quot;.It&#39;s honestly a really shitty name and I thought the original idea of &quot;brain orgasm&quot; explained it better, but the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr">community</a> doesn&#39;t take kindly to that since it&#39;s not a sexual thing. To actually describe the feeling is a bit difficult as there&#39;s nothing really to relate it to. The usual description is &quot;head tingles&quot; and, while that&#39;s not entirely untrue, it doesn&#39;t seem quite accurate either. I&#39;d describe it more as a feeling of mild pressure sensation on the top and back of the scalp that will at times &quot;bloom&quot; in intensity across the scalp in response to stimuli. Yes, there are also tingles.</p>
<p>What triggers this seems to be hit and miss. Slow, steady, soft speech patterns or rustling noises can do it, so does close personal attention such as a visit to the eye doctor. The aforementioned community is a subreddit that deals in posting videos that cause this sensation for people. These generally range from creepy videos of people whispering things into a microphone to creepy videos of people making various noises with various things or sometimes role play videos that are a mix of the two. There&#39;s no getting around the creepy factor, because it is and doubly so if you don&#39;t know what the fuck is going on.</p>
<p>As for myself and my history with this... condition(?), I&#39;ve had it for as long as I can remember. I recall fairly well the first time I actually tried to vocalize it to somebody. One of my cousins and I were coloring at my grandma&#39;s house and I said something about tickles in my brain. I believe I was six or seven at the time. My young self would try to figure out ways of inducing the &quot;tingles&quot;, at one point settling on raising and lowering my eyebrows repeatedly in erratic patterns (the results were mixed).</p>
<p>As I rolled into my later teen years, I kind of forgot about whole thing except when I would go to the optometrist. It wasn&#39;t until mid-2012 when I saw an ad for the subreddit that it was brought back to my attention and a little bit of perspective put on the whole thing. Having been tuned back into the phenomenon and having a better idea of how to trigger it, I tested the waters with the creepy videos and, though it&#39;s hit and miss, they work. Now, late in the evening, I&#39;ll often put one of those videos on, lay down on my bed or the couch with my earbuds in, and take a train to Relaxation Town.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite nice, really.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Getting Around the Iron Curtains</h2><time>February 23, 2014</time><div><p>Last week, a friend clued me into CloudFlare, a CDN service that also somehow has a free tier with unlimited bandwidth. This played right into my fears of hitting the 4TB bandwidth ceiling on my current hosting tier. Put into perspective, that&#39;s pretty close to all the digital storage I have available in my apartment. Also, it quells the fears that users on the other side of the pond are getting subpar download times. So, with minimal weighing of the consequences, I flipped everything over. And, lo and behold, it worked!</p>
<p>Almost...</p>
<p>You see, some countries and ISPs think that blocking shit on the internet is a really great idea. I&#39;m not going to go on a political rampage right now because that&#39;s not my style, but when you&#39;re getting messages about users unable to download content from your hosting due to these reasons, it&#39;s more than a little irritating. But, goddammit, I&#39;m a programmer and there had to be a solution that&#39;d get me the best of both worlds without shelling out additional money.</p>
<p>After disabling the caching layer on that subdomain (cdn.awwni.me), I began weighing my options. Somehow I needed to find out if a particular user had the ability to talk to CloudFlare (now working through licdn.awwni.me). Most views were going to be served straight out of reddit.com, but I had a couple of attack vectors: the redditbooru.com main site, which is hit often for people doing repost checks or looking at albums that have been posted to reddit, and the RedditBooru browser extensions. The former was going to be the easiest to tinker with (so I thought) and affect the most people.</p>
<p>Since I had a way to test availability, I needed to actually perform the test itself. What I devised was an iframe that would be loaded on every page of RedditBooru. It would load the following script:</p>
<p>[code=html]<html>
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="http://licdn.awwni.me/cdncheck.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>[/code]</p>
<p>[code=javascript]// If this page has managed to load, go ahead and set the CDN cookie to expire on my 100th birthday
var date = (new Date(&#39;2086/6/8&#39;)).toGMTString();
document.cookie = &#39;use_cdn=true; expires=&#39; + date;[/code]</p>
<p>If the user has access to the licdm subdomain, a cookie is set noting such and does so on the cdn.awwni.me domain. Since these users were now marked, this information can be used in nginx to reroute the user.</p>
<p>[code=nginx]if ($host != licdn.awwni.me) {
    set $useCdn &quot;P&quot;;
}</p>
<pre><code>if ($http_cookie ~* &#39;use_cdn&#39;) {
set $useCdn &quot;${useCdn}C&quot;;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>if ($useCdn = PC) {
            rewrite ^/(.*) <a href="http://licdn.awwni.me/$1">http://licdn.awwni.me/$1</a> permanent;
}[/code]</p>
<p>Getting around nginx&#39; inability to do multiple conditionals in one line aside, the above checks to make sure that the cookie is set and that the user is <em>not</em> coming from the licdn.awwni.me domain. That last bit was added when I accidentally set the CDN cookie on licdn and got caught in an infinite redirect loop for a while. If either of the conditions aren&#39;t met, the image will just serve out of my machine.</p>
<p>There are a few drawbacks to this approach. First of all, every request still hits my machine, so I&#39;m still taking a bandwidth hit. Secondly, those getting served out of the CDN have an extra hop for the redirect. However, I believe neither of these issues are bad enough to warrant removing it completely. For starters, on my side I&#39;m now only serving a handful of bytes as opposed to millions. Secondly, a redirect on a single image is pretty much inconsequential to the user&#39;s experience.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve only been running with this solution for a few hours, so I don&#39;t yet have a good look on how great the benefits are. Time will tell on that one, but I haven&#39;t yet heard any issues on images not loading, so there&#39;s some comfort.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My God, I am a creepy person</h2><time>February 15, 2014</time><div><p>I have this personal website, which essentially means I am my own little mini NSA. If I wanted to, for example, find out if a person I have very few details on were to visit here, I&#39;d be able to find that out. Let&#39;s say, for example, I know what probable day they&#39;d view this blog, what page they&#39;d be coming from, and approximately where they live.</p>
<p>Well, I have enough data to know (probably) if that person hit my site and what they did when they got here.</p>
<p>As a hypothetical example, let&#39;s say I know they&#39;re somewhere in Northern California, probably came to the homepage via a Google search, and did so on February 13th. Alright, first thing&#39;s first, grep the logs for that day, that page, and exclude crawlers...</p>
<p>Sweet, now I have a list of IPs. Let&#39;s plug those into <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip_demo">MaxMind geoip lookup</a> and see what comes of it.</p>
<p>Hmm, no exact match, but ISPs are fuzzy about location and this one is certainly within the area! Alright, now grep the logs for that IP address...</p>
<p>Okay, the person was on the homepage for about three seconds before going to the art page. Once there, they clicked on <a href="http://dxprog.com/uploads/Vesperia-Doll.jpg">three</a> <a href="http://dxprog.com/uploads/Kagami_Doll.jpg">pieces</a> of <a href="http://dxprog.com/uploads/HanakoChristmas.jpg">art</a> before leaving the site. All in all, about a minute of time elapsed between the first and final requests.</p>
<p>Other fun things you can find out while grepping logs is that your mother and former boss are the most frequent visitors to your site. The latter - going under a pseudonym - even listened to the Inception soundtrack on your music page sometime back in November while at work.</p>
<p>This is, of course, all hypothetical.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Systems Architecture in the Unknown</h2><time>January 29, 2014</time><div><p>Just over a year ago, I launched <a href="http://redditbooru.com">redditbooru</a> to the world, rolling together a bunch of ideas spawned by the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">awwnime repost checker</a> into a single place. In addition to that, I added the ability for users to host content in addition to being able to index multiple subreddits. To say that it became a wild success would almost be selling it short. At launch, it was indexing maybe 5 subs, now it&#39;s 16, my server went from averaging ~23/Kbps per month to over 10/Mbps, and am nearing 100k pageviews for a rolling 30 day period. Despite exponential growth in traffic, the site has experienced almost no traffic related issues proving that my code is able to handle scale. What started off as a fun little afternoon of experimenting has become quite a success.</p>
<p>However, things are not without their flaws. On the technical side, the cron that does the indexing has some issues; items hosted through redditbooru can&#39;t be posted to more than one sub and indexed in both places and sometimes, in an attempt to pick up on items removed by mods, posts will be incorrectly marked as hidden. On the front end, the user experience is a bit of a mess as I kept bolting on features. In typical Matt Hackmann fashion, I decided that I would rework the entire thing mostly from the ground up with all of my learnings in mind while adding in some user requests. But, I was going to eschew the tried and true PHP/MySQL setup for nodejs/MySQL/mongodb in an attempt to learn something new and bring myself up to speed with the current development fad.</p>
<p>Two weeks into development, I am questioning that decision.[break]</p>
<h2 id="nodejs-and-asynchronous-programming">nodejs and Asynchronous Programming</h2>
<p>Outside of writing some standard libs, the first thing to get running was the indexer. In the past, <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/cron_reddit-booru.php">this was a PHP script run on cron</a> every five minutes or so. One great thing about node is that it&#39;s incredibly simple to write a program that can handle this kind of time management itself. Also, it can do a great many things at once due to its push for making all the things asynchronous. My goal was to make the new indexer able to update all of the subs once per minute and, for the most part, I&#39;ve achieved that. But not without issues along the way.</p>
<p>Say you have 16 different sources you need to get data for once per minute. Currently, you have 16 async ops queued. Now, when each of those resolves, you&#39;re getting 100 posts back from reddit and each of those items is going to need to be acted on, either to create a new post entry or update stats about an old one. Okay, 1600 async ops. If the post is new you&#39;re going to need to do the following:</p>
<p>[list][item]need to make an entry in MySQL with all the post data. asyncOps += 1[/item]
[item]determine where the source data is being hosted. If it&#39;s an image, cool. Go to step 4[/item]
[item]if it&#39;s not an image and, say, an album on imgur, we need to resolve that to a list of images. asyncOps += 1[/item]
[item]we know what images to get, so now we need to retrieve them. this can be done either by external request or a cached version in a mongo store. Either way, asyncOps += numberOfImages[/item]
[item]once the image has downloaded, cached (which can add yet another asyncOp), and processed, we need to create a row for it in MySQL. asyncOps += 1[/item]
[item]once the above operation has comeback with an image ID, we need to save a local copy of the image for serving (asyncOps += 1) and also save a copy to an Amazon S3 store for archival (asyncOp += 1)[/item]
[item]assuming all of that was successful, we need to associate the image to the post, creating yet another row in another table. asyncOps += 1[/item]
[item]assuming all of the above was successful, an object is created from the post and image data and stored in mongo for consumption by the frontend. asyncOps += 1[/item][/list]</p>
<p>So, at an absolute minimum, that&#39;s 7 asynchronous operations per new post. Remember, there could very well be 1600 of these, all that need to be resolved within a minute and the whole operation starts all over again. But, when you have so many waiting operations, things start to fall through the cracks; HTTP calls stop resolving, MySQL calls are either never made or just never heard from again. It&#39;s a bad situation. To get around that problem, I cobbled together a queue system. Reddit requests and post creation/updates are tossed in a big array which is processed every tenth of a second. Added to that, every time an async request is made, a counter is incremented so that the queue system will stop processing once there are so many active async operations. Were I to set that number to one, effectively I&#39;ve just gone back to synchronous code. I initially set the limiter to 100, though due to a problem I will discuss in just a moment, brought it down to 50. And even then, there are issues. But, for the most part, everything updates within the 1 minute time period and hums along nicely. Until...</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-programming-and-memory-management">Asynchronous Programming and Memory Management</h2>
<p>Say you have a program that analyzes images on a per pixel basis. That requires an incredible amount of memory. redditbooru&#39;s largest hosted image is in the ballpark of 9000x6000 and when you expand that out into 4-byte uncompressed RGBA values, that&#39;s a whopping 206MB. Now, that&#39;s an extreme case; the average image size is 1041x1065, or 4.3MB of uncompressed data. But, since we can have up to 50 things going at once, there&#39;s a potential for 215MB of image data floating around on average. Toss in some of those larger images and you could quite easily exceed the amount of total memory in the system. I&#39;ve been leaving the indexer running for the last several days to ensure its stability, but I came home today to find out it had irrecoverably crashed at some point because it simply ran out of memory. You could have a separate process ensuring that the indexer is always running (similar to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-plate-and-the-amount-of-stuff-on-it/">what I&#39;ve got implemented in production</a>), but an errant process gobbling up memory is going to slow everything else down, and when you&#39;ve only got the one machine, things need to be as lean as possible.</p>
<p>At this point, I&#39;m at a loss as to how to proceed on that issue. There are a few options:</p>
<p>[list][item]Decrease the queue limiter again[/item]
[item]Add a similar queue to the image processor so that it only runs[/item]
[item]Rearchitect the indexer to run as individual processes and then have a master program spawn a handful of them as needed[/item]
[item]Write an image processor in some respectable language (C++) that does all the image processing[/item]
[item]Go back to PHP[/item][/list]</p>
<h2 id="mongodb-i-don-t-even-need-to-say-anything-else">mongodb - I don&#39;t even need to say anything else</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been slowly testing the waters with mongo. The concept is interesting, and the promise of running at &quot;web scale&quot; is certainly alluring. However, mongo&#39;s been getting all sorts of bad press and the golden child of the NoSQL era seems to be losing popularity. Still, for my need for having denormalized data, the query mechanism that mongo provides, and a (perceived) notion that it&#39;s supposed to be very good in a read heavy environment, I thought I&#39;d give it a try. Hell, I was even going to see if I could avoid the need for memcache. However, because the front end exclusively relies on this dataset, it needs to reflect the actual database very closely. But, as I found out when testing the image search endpoint, for a given set of image IDs coming back from MySQL, one image was missing from mongo&#39;s store causing javascript&#39;s equivalent of a null pointer exception. Confused, I checked the number of items in MySQL versus the number in mongo.</p>
<p>8% of all images were not accounted for in mongo.</p>
<p>Going back to the list of stuff the cron does above, we know that the very last thing to happen on image creation is the store to mongo. The image has been downloaded, processed, synced to MySQL, saved to disk, and uploaded to AWS. I would expect any one of these to fail before simply inserting an simple object into mongo, something that should never fail because it has no constraint checks. But for 8% of all these inserts to simply... vanish on reported success, it&#39;s like all those warnings I&#39;d read about mongo coming true before my eyes. Luckily, I saw this failure well before it ever hit production. I guess what I&#39;ll do here is move the mongo schema to MySQL and reinstate the memcache layer or maybe even write some internal caching in the js side itself. Or I could forgo that schema entirely and just live with the four or five joins needed to make that data happen. Mongo I&#39;ll keep around for analytics dumping, user sessions, and downloaded image cache, but never again will I consider it for client facing data.</p>
<h2 id="in-summation">In Summation</h2>
<p>Given the two weeks I&#39;ve been working on this and the problems I&#39;ve had already (and the problems still outstanding), I&#39;m wondering why I ever considered moving away from PHP. It&#39;s stable, reliable, and fails predictably all on top of me being well versed in how to write it and write it well. I&#39;m happy for the learning experience that&#39;s come out of all this and has probably helped make me a slightly better developer over all, but going where I&#39;ve never gone before on a &quot;massive&quot; project may not be the wisest decision after all. At the same time, I want to know if using this environment will make things faster, more scalable, with less overhead. Of course, Digg did this same thing in the summer of 2010.</p>
<p>And look at what happened to them...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Anime Reviews 2013 - It Builds Character</h2><time>January 18, 2014</time><div><p>We&#39;re leisurely sauntering towards the finish line this year. Will we make it to the end? Maybe. But, as for today, here are the best/worst characters of 2013.</p>
<h2 id="best-characters">Best Characters</h2>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mzjz.jpg" alt="" title="The bokeh comes for free">
<strong>Chris - Yutaka Hasebe (Servant x Service)</strong>
When I first started watching Servant x Service, I honestly expected the characters to be set in stone in the first episode, staying as largely unchanged archetypes as the show progressed. This largely holds true for most of the characters, but there is an exception - Yutaka Hasebe.</p>
<p>His character starts out relatively one-dimensional, seemingly just a persistently happy, lazy bum with a penchant for collecting girls phone numbers. A pleasant enough bloke, as it stands. However, during the show&#39;s progression, you see that there is more to him than meets the eye, especially as you see him attempt to open up to Lucy about his feelings for her.</p>
<p>This blew my mind, as here we had a really fun, likable character with believable development, something that&#39;s almost unheard of in these sorts of slice of life shows. It really makes me want a second season just so I can see how he continues to develop as a character.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mzk3.jpg" alt="" title="Hyper spastic and ready to go!">
<strong>Jeff - Mako Mankanshoku (Kill la Kill)/Yutaka Hasebe (Servant x Service)</strong>
After several visions, and revisions, of this writing, I can find no better explanation for these two characters being the best than: They are my favorites. Sometimes I can write down my feelings, other times I can&#39;t. Negativity seems to be one I can always voice, though...</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mzk2.jpg" alt="" title="Them dark circles...">
<strong>Matt - Tomoko Kuroki (Watamote)</strong>
Tomoko is a broken person, there&#39;s no two ways about that. She&#39;s socially inept to the point that it might actually be diagnosable. But, there&#39;s a certain charm about her over the top delusions and awkwardness that keep her in the realm of likeable character. Her rampant imagination of how she predicts a social situation will play out versus her inability to actually say two words to a stranger, even a cashier, is pitiably lovable. Perhaps there&#39;s a bit of self-identification there; lord knows that I&#39;ve got my share of social anxieties from cenversating to my appearance. Tomoko, her awkward antics and highly cynical world view, get the knowing nod of approval and my vote for best character of last year.</p>
<h2 id="worst-character">Worst Character</h2>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mzk1.jpg" alt="" title="Looks are deceiving">
<strong>Chris - Kaga Kouko (Golden Time)</strong>
I like to think that I&#39;m pretty good at withholding judgement on characters until I&#39;ve had a few episodes to evaluate them, but boy shit did Kaga Kouko shatter that image. From her very first appearance in the very first episode I knew she was going to be a bitch deluxe.
However, that&#39;s not all. In addition to being the queen of bitches, she&#39; the needy and possessive empress of all bitches. This is really a problem, especially as far as the main character Tada Banri is concerned, given that not only does he put up with her fucking shit, he appears to be charmed by it. This blows my goddamn mind.
That such a relationship could be considered satisfying, let alone healthy, by any of the characters caught up in the whole shit storm indicates that anybody going along with it is clearly brain dead. This leads me to the hypothesis that Banri didn&#39;t lose his memories, he just lost his whole goddamn brain, and it&#39;s still sitting there under that fucking bridge, projecting it&#39;s angst in his general direction.
Oh shit, did I forget to mention that she’s also crazy rich, talentless, and completely entitled? I’m just glad Yana - her former &quot;boyfriend&quot; (read: possession) - had the balls to stand up and say, &quot;Bitch, you cray cray!&quot;
Perhaps that makes Yana the runner up for character of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Kaga Kouko (Golden Time)</strong>
You know the phrase &quot;don&#39;t stick your dick in crazy&quot;? Kaga Kouko, female lead in a series brought to us by the writer of Toradora!, is essentially the poster girl for the phrase. When she&#39;s first introduced, she&#39;s infatuated with her childhood friend and is not discrete about showing it. She&#39;s possessive, controlling, and has a jealous streak beyond all reason. Once said friend finally gets it through her thick skull that he hates her very existence, she replaces him with the show&#39;s lead, Tada Banri. During the brief transitional period, we find out that she&#39;s not really a bitch on purpose; she has a codependency problem larger than the Burj Khalifa. By her own admission, she simply cannot live unless she has a man to fawn over. That&#39;s all annoying in and of itself, but the fact that everybody enables her in this is what&#39;s really maddening. She&#39;s going to win the day (over better, stable, more personable girls) without any of her core problems being resolved when, in the end, all she really needs is a fuck ton of therapy. This show has only finished it&#39;s first cour, but I&#39;m not hopeful for the end or any redemption of Ms. Clingy Psychobitch.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mzk0.jpg" alt="" title="If the eyes are the window to the soul, I don&#39;t want to see hers">
<strong>Jeff - Nase Izumi (Beyond the Boundary)</strong>
Typically, this spot is reserved for Kirino Kosaka. But she&#39;s such an awful character that she could get this every year and never be in danger of losing it, which makes for boring reading and is a tad cliche. So, in the spirit of keeping this different/fair, I went with Izumi Nase from&quot; Beyond the Boundary&quot;. Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s still a bitch, just in different ways. She doesn&#39;t explain herself, ever, waltzs around following orders blindly for some douchebag in a wheelchair, and generally holds herself above everyone else in such a way as to come off as being elitist. And she&#39;s ice cold to everyone around her, including family. Spoiler alert: She put a hit on Akihito and treated him like he wasn&#39;t even a sentient being just because he had a youmu inside him. Guess what? More spoilers: she also has a youmu inside her, and she was aware of it the entire time. What a bitch.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all for today. Maybe we&#39;ll have the last installment up before the month is out. Maybe we won&#39;t...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>That Which is Done Annually</h2><time>January 3, 2014</time><div><p>As is per normal for me, it&#39;s time again to reexamine myself and birth a new Matt Hackmann with the new year. It&#39;s funny how this has become a thing because I used to be vehemently against &quot;New Year&#39;s Resolutions&quot;, taking that stance that a person should be able enact change at any time of the year. But, moreso than that, it&#39;s a barometer to measure how well those changes actually went. Anybody who knows a little bit about statistics knows that you need to monitor trends over time to get the most accurate data. All that said, let&#39;s see how I did against last year&#39;s list.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - To be fair, I actually started out the year pretty well. I all but ceased fast food and was even getting in my daily walking. However, the move to California but a big fat wrench into all that. I write this have just downed half of a Papa John&#39;s pizza. There were some upsides, though, such as the fact that work is within a bikeable distance. Negating anything gained from that, though, was the big uptick in alcohol consumption. It&#39;s amazing how easy it is to drink when there are other people to drink with.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Again, the job change had a unique impact on this category. The hard goals I had set out for myself were to reduce superfluous spending and eliminate my LASIK, credit card, and car debts. The middle two I actually accomplished and the car is within reach. However, if anything, the amount of money I dropped on a whim definitely increased, but because of the salary adjustment, I wasn&#39;t hurting as much for it.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - I bought the stuff and made absolutely no progress on this at all.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - Mission accomplished with a repeat trip tentatively planned for 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Pfffffft!</p>
<h2 id="the-2014-version">The 2014 Version</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to shoot for simplicity this year, so here&#39;s the plan (that I will not follow):</p>
<p><strong>Eat Better</strong> - Again, fast food moratorium (as soon as my Taco Bell gift card is gone and the aforementioned pizza). It&#39;s easy enough to eat healthy at work (portion control being the most difficult part), but this needs to be carried over when I&#39;m not there. Going to have to compile a list of not-terrible-for-me-but-good-for-my-tastebuds recipes.</p>
<p><strong>Bike 150 miles every month</strong> - Once over the initial &quot;three week to develop a habit&quot; hump, this will actually be easy. My round trip work commute is twelve miles, so if I did that five days a week, that&#39;d actually be 200+ miles per month. I&#39;m giving a little bit of slack though. Start slow and all that.</p>
<p><strong>The Girlfriend Factor</strong> - I&#39;ve been single long enough. Time to push past my shyness and make that shit happen.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#39;d say two of those three things is attainable. We&#39;ll see what things are looking like when I write this post again next year.</p>

<h2 id="biggest-surprise">Biggest Surprise</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qrZZgaW.jpg" alt="" title="Flowers of Evil">
[b]Chris - <em>Flowers of Evil</em>[/b]</p>
<p>This was a weird one. Initially, I made an attempt to watch the first episode because I wanted to see what was up with the art style. I was pretty revolted and didn’t get much farther than a few minutes in, determining then that I would never pick the series back up. However, as the season progressed, and good reviews for the series - at least from American outlets - began rolling in, I gave the show a second shot. And so it was that I marathoned the show over the course of two days. Fuck me, man.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t realize on my first attempt was how good the story was, as I hadn&#39;t seen enough due to the art style turning me off. But as I progressed through the series, even the visuals began to grow on me, and not because I found them attractive, per se, but because they work so goddamn well for the story being told. They provide a perfect, unsettling feel that works with the story, music, and direction to make you uncomfortable, and that’s how the show ended up being so effective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, chances of a second season are pretty much non-existent, which saddens me given the open ending and the tease in the last episode showing moments from farther along in the manga. But in any case, I’m glad I gave this show a chance.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o40rHvb.jpg" alt="" title="Girls und Panzer">
[b]Matt - <em>Girls und Panzer</em>[/b]</p>
<p>In a genre filled with &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; shows, I would have expected Girls und Panzer, a series centering around - surprise, surprise - high school girls who drive and battle tanks, to be more of the same. And while there is plenty of pandering in that area, the show seems to concentrate more on the tank battles and the tactics around them instead of the girls&#39; antics. For the silly ass plot, it&#39;s surprisingly engaging without being dull or saccharine sweet. The suspension of disbelief becomes a little difficult when there are live ammunition rounds flying everywhere, tanks flipping, and lots of explosions without any of the characters getting a scratch, but it&#39;s a wholly enjoyable romp. I mean, c&#39;mon. You have to give credit to any show making such a blatant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qF51ApP5PA">homage to the Spam sketch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-letdown">Biggest Letdown</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hsl22ww.jpg" alt="" title="Henneko">
[b]Chris - <em>The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat</em>[/b]
I’m not gonna lie, I enjoyed Henneko. It was sometimes funny and occasionally touching, but I still can&#39;t contain my raging disappointment with certain parts of the show.</p>
<p>For starters, Kantoku&#39;s character designs didn&#39;t translate as well to the Anime as I was hoping. I&#39;m chalking this up to JC Staff, a studio I’m pretty consistently disappointed with in terms of production values, but that&#39;s a rant for another day.</p>
<p>Another problem I have is with main girl Tsukiko. I think Tsukiko is okay, but she’s not great - or at least she isn’t past the first episode. It&#39;s at first funny and a little charming when Tsukiko loses her ability to emote, but it gets old fast, and I kept wishing that at some point she would regain this ability. As it was, I was treated to 11 episodes about a cadaver with speaking abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#39;s the issue of best girl, Azuki Azusa, and how you know she&#39;s going to get shafted in the game of love, overtaken by an almost literal piece of cardboard, much the same way that Kanna Tanigawa from Ano Natsu de Matteru got her heart gutted by a figurative piece of cardboard last year.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;m still bitter over that one.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hBHkxUl.jpg" alt="" title="Oreimo 2">
[b]Matt - <em>My Little Sister Can&#39;t Be This Cute (Season 2 OVAs)</em>[/b]
I suppose in a show entitled &quot;My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute&quot; I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that they ended it how they did. However, I was lead to believe that this show was going to eschew the images suggested by the title and simply be about a couple of estranged siblings making amends and the journey to get there… not to half-assedly take the incest route, crushing souls all along the way. And even in the end, the author doesn’t commit to this serving of taboo (apparently forced by the publisher) and cops out of the whole thing. Whatever, I was more butthurt over this ending than I should have been especially considering that I really wasn&#39;t attached to the show… or at least, that’s what I thought. It makes me uneasy that the bitch herself is currently at the top of the &quot;popular art&quot; block and <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/weekend-swag/">also stares at me as I’m falling asleep</a>...</p>
<h2 id="what-the-fuck-anime-">What the Fuck, Anime?</h2>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mww0.jpg" alt="" title="GJ-bu">
[b]Matt - <em>GJ-Club</em>[/b]
GJ-bu (or &quot;Good Job Club&quot;) is, on the surface, Yet-Another-Do-Nothing-Club™ anime that&#39;s also kind of harem-y with a dash of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things®. Kyouya is our male protagonist in a club with four (at some point, five) girls. Apparently, they kidnapped him and (presumably) forced him to join. That kind of sets the tone for the entire show, really. He is their boy toy; a male upon which they can fire off odd females wiles… I guess, I mean they&#39;re not wiles I would ever associate as being stereotypically female. For example, they&#39;re teasing him about whether he thinks he&#39;s popular with the girls and they all start rubbing themselves on him. Or they all get him to brush their hair at some point (this show has a serious hair fetish) which moistens all the women&#39;s panties, apparently.</p>

<p>It&#39;s derogatory to both sexes, it seems; the females act like they need a man, so they order this balless wimp around like they’re in some sort of cute S&amp;M dungeon.</p>

<p>The characters are kind of cute, I guess, and there are a few genuinely funny moments (mostly when &quot;Hachiman&quot; shows up), but that sub-text just makes the whole show feel unsettling.[/i]</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Ja* - A Tale of Two Countries</h2><time>December 25, 2013</time><div><p>2013 marked my first foray into the joys of international travel, doing it not once but twice. In an interesting twist of fate, both of those countries started with the letters &quot;JA&quot; (the only two in the world, even). They are worlds apart, however, both in physical distance and atmosphere/culture. Let&#39;s do a pros/cons.</p>
<h2 id="japan">Japan</h2>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody is very respectful of others and mostly keep to themselves. The introvert in me loves this.</li>
<li>It&#39;s clean. Though some places may look a little run down, the overall level of cleanliness is pretty high</li>
<li>Shit is organized. There were a couple of times when the road to Asakusa was blocked for utility work or something and they had cones marking precisely how traffic was now being directed... and also a friendly guy there to point you in the right direction.</li>
<li>Conversion rate is essentially 1JPY = 0.01USD. Makes for easy conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Probably contrary to the cleanliness bit, there was a constant smell of old garbage/water mold lingering around. It was only in certain spots, but it was a trifle off putting.</li>
<li>Cramped. The trains, the layout of the buildings, etc is designed to pack the most stuff into the smallest space. Not great for my introversion and large body.</li>
<li>Language barrier. They <em>really</em> don&#39;t speak English well when they do at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jamaica">Jamaica</h2>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The resorts are such that you really never need to leave; all your whims are attended to</li>
<li>The beach</li>
<li>The exchange rate for the Jamaican dollar is about 1JMD = 0.01USD. Granted, you may as well just use American money because it&#39;s less likely to depreciate in value and everybody takes it anyways.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It may seem like everybody is super friendly, but it&#39;s that kind of friend that stops paying attention to you when they find out you&#39;re not popular/don&#39;t have money/etc. Money gets you everywhere.</li>
<li>The food will make you shit... a lot and explosively. If you&#39;re wise, you&#39;ll pull a Steven Spielberg and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark#Filming">bring your own food</a>.</li>
<li>The Jamaicans running the tourist stuff are essentially parodies of the stereotype. So much &quot;mon&quot;, Bob Marley, and general &quot;no shits given&quot; (the above shits excepting) were way, way overused. Also, my brand of &quot;fun&quot; and theirs are very different, but they&#39;ll try to force it on you anyways. Granted, I&#39;ve had friends try to get me involved in such activities as well. Looking at you, dancing...</li>
<li>Jamaica is a third world country. Outside the fancy resorts and tourist spots, it&#39;s really fucking run down and the people are super poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the battle of J countries, Japan is the obvious victor (though, my opinion is certainly heavily biased).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Anime Reviews 2013 - Play That Funky Music</h2><time>December 23, 2013</time><div><p>It&#39;s time again for the wave of anime reviews from the brothers Hack (swear we&#39;ll actually finish this year). Per usual, we&#39;re kicking it off by picking our top openers and enders of the year. Steve is absent this year because he&#39;s being <em>super lazy</em> and lying on the couch whining that he doesn&#39;t have enough time to write - forget the fact that Chris and Jeff started and finished just moments ago. But whatever, here we go!</p>
<h2 id="best-opener">Best Opener</h2>

<p>[b)Matt - Guren no Yumiya (<em>Attack on Titan</em>)[/b]</p>
<p>Trying to figure out what the best songs of the year is a difficult task. It&#39;s even worse when you have to write words about why you enjoy said aural experience. But, this year was completely easy. The very first time I heard Attack on Titan’s first opening back, I knew it was going to be taking this position. The music itself is all fired up and high energy, with lots of choral bits, lots of trumpets, and just general awesomeness. Married perfectly with this amazing track is some slick, high production animation with lots of high action scenes and some interesting typographical interludes. Overall, these two pieces combined make for one hell of an opener and will not be easily matched anytime soon.</p>
<p>[break]</p>
<p>[b]Chris - Guren no Yumiya (<em>Attack on Titan</em>)[/b]</p>
<p>We all know this is the case, so this doesn’t really need to be said, but Guren no Yumiya was by far the best OP of 2013.  Not only is the song excellent - although this sadly doesn&#39;t carry over to the full version - but the visuals work with the song to get you super pumped up and your pants off.  That&#39;s pretty badass.</p>
<p>[![youtube video](<a href="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2c1GN5O6mx4">https://img.youtube.com/vi/2c1GN5O6mx4</a>]</p>

<p><em>(Note - this is a promotional video and not the actual opener. It is the right song, however)</em></p>
<p>[b)Jeff - May I Help You? (<em>Servent x Service</em>)[/b]</p>
<p>&quot;May I help you?&quot; from &quot;Servant x Service&quot; Is the opening theme I have chosen to be the best of the year. Originally I was going to go with &quot;Guren no Yumiya&quot;, but the full version of said song cannot be rightfully called such and was dropped like a sack of shit. That was on fire. And also poisonous.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still super pissed about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;May I help you?&quot; is a delightfully upbeat song and a pleasure to listen to in both the short and long versions. I was going to write more about why I like this song, but I don&#39;t have anything more to say about it. Listen to it. Love it.</p>
<p>Fuck you, &quot;Guren No Yumiya long version&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="best-ending">Best Ending</h2>

<p>[b)Matt - Bokura no Tsubasa (<em>Haganai NEXT</em>)[/b]</p>
<p>Sadly, unlike the hands down winner that was best OP, I had to go back to play stats for best ED, but I’d say this fits the bill. I can’t say why I enjoyed it, but it’s certainly catchy and I can’t think of anything better to put here.</p>
<p>[b]Chris - Bokura no Tsubasa (<em>Haganai NEXT</em>)[/b]</p>
<p>I’m really not good at writing about music - fuck that shit - but I will say that Haganai S2 has a very good ED from a musical standpoint.  But, more than that, I found the art that went with it to be very beautiful, using a mixture of bright - but not oversaturated - colors and outlines to create a very nice visual aesthetic.  I usually sit through the ending anytime I watch an episode of anime, but I made special care to do so in this case.</p>

<p>[b)Jeff - Daisy (<em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em>)[/b]</p>
<p>Initially I was going to go write off 2013 as not having produced a single super great ending song and that it sucked. Then I watched Watamote and found &quot;Natsu Matsuri&quot;. This was it. The one ED of 2013 that I found super great.</p>
<p>Then I heard &quot;Daisy&quot; from &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; and chose that instead.</p>
<p>Yes, &quot;Daisy&quot; is most definitely my favorite 2013 ending. I feel that it caps off each episode perfectly, and emanates a feeling of hope regardless of how the episode ended. To say nothing of the fact that it sounds damn nice would be an atrocity.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Fuck you, &quot;Guren No Yumiya long version&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for day one. Check in later for the next wave!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Days of Future Past</h2><time>December 21, 2013</time><div><p>I don&#39;t entirely recall why, but last year I sent my one-year-in-the-future self a note with what I predicted would be my life in 2013. Yesterday, I received that letter.</p>
<p>[quote]Dear Me (in the future),
I&#39;m doing this on a whim, nothing really to say. devusb has said that 2013 would be the year you get a girlfriend, but your current self is dubious. My predictions for 2013 are a repeat of 2012 with the possibility of having a house. Hopefully that trip to Japan happened and that you got a Super Famicom (with Panel de Pon if&#39;n you can swing it). Good luck, we&#39;re all counting on you![/quote]</p>
<p>Not much said, but I&#39;m 2/3 in predictions. The needle on the girl front went even less of anywhere this year than last and that Japan trip certainly did happen (with the SFC and Panel de Pon). That one part in the middle is so wrong, though, that saying my letter was 66% correct doesn&#39;t seem quite fair.</p>
<p>Because as has been stated before, this year was nothing like 2012.</p>
<p>Now, to go pen myself a letter for next year.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My Life Can&#x27;t Be This Interesting</h2><time>December 12, 2013</time><div><p>I&#39;m sitting in the Atlanta airport awaiting the flight that will whisk me into Jamaica to celebrate the marriage of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">oldest friend</a>. I&#39;m short on sleep, having lost three hours on the flight over from the Pacific coast, and am oddly reflective on the previous year.</p>
<p>Never have I considered my life to be anything interesting. When I&#39;m not at work, I&#39;m generally doing nothing. Or, at least nothing outside. My down time consists of bumming around on the internet, watching TV, or playing video games. It&#39;s an introverted bachelor&#39;s paradise; I wouldn&#39;t even know what to do &quot;outside&quot; if I were to venture out of my hallowed kingdom. But, somehow, 2013 has turned some of that on its head and been by far the most interesting year of my time alive. Items of particular note are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Got a job at fuckin&#39; LinkedIn.</strong> I still don&#39;t understand how this happened, but it&#39;s been by far the best thing that&#39;s happened to me</li>
<li><strong>Moved to the fuckin&#39; Bay Area.</strong> Second best thing that&#39;s happened to me. I don&#39;t think I could live anywhere else again (except maybe Japan)</li>
<li><strong>Went to fuckin&#39; Japan!</strong> Ever since my brothers and I were bitten by the anime bug back in 2008, this was something we wanted to realize... and we made it happen! Every now and then I still get super bummed that I&#39;m not there right now.</li>
<li><strong>Fuckin&#39; presented at my alma mater.</strong> Perhaps it was slightly egotistical of me to want, but ever since I graduated Full Sail in 2009, I&#39;d hoped to return as a presenter. And this year LinkedIn helped me realize that on a campus recruiting mission.</li>
<li><strong>Got fuckin&#39; drunk... many times.</strong> Perhaps this shouldn&#39;t be a highlight, but these drinking sprees have given me an opportunity to connect with so many awesome people. Perhaps it&#39;s not the medium so much as it is the setting. Either way, I&#39;ve had many great conversations over one too many beers.</li>
<li><strong>Fuckin&#39; brackets, son</strong>. In addition to the awesome people I get to physically see on a daily basis, there&#39;s the community over at /r/awwnime that I&#39;ve come to know as well. And running the brackets this year is fun for me both because I get to watch people enjoy (or hate) a thing I&#39;ve created, but also because it brings out a lot of interesting discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Went (or am going) to fuckin&#39; Jamaica</strong> to participate in the wedding of <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">my oldest friend.</a> (Holy shit dude. You win!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are only the major highlights, but 2013 has been a hell of a year. It&#39;s made me realize just how awesome my life is and at the same time makes me wonder what I ever did to deserve it. And every day I&#39;m so thankful that I get to wake up where I am, go to where I work, and interact with all the wonderful people that I know. If I were manlier, I might even shed a tear.</p>
<p>But enough of that smarmy ass sentimental bullshit, expect pictures of Jamaican shores and the annual anime reviews to be kicking up soon. But until then, <a href="http://www.baconorbeercan.com/">I leave you with this</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Math to the Rescue</h2><time>November 7, 2013</time><div><p>The bracket, which I have mentioned so many times by this point, continues to be an entirely intriguing project. Brackets in general are a very math heavy thing, full of all sorts of logistical and statistical related calculations. Setting up a bracket per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports">standard sports seeding</a>) was a bit of a fun nut to crack by itself. However, the interesting problems have been the ones relating to issues cropping up while the bracket&#39;s running.</p>
<p>Eliminations and actual user voting began last Saturday and was off to a pretty good start. The next day had an even better turnout. And so it&#39;s continued.</p>
<p>Day 1 - 7054 votes, 370 users
Day 2 - 9947 votes, 623 users
Day 3 - 11512 votes, 647 users
Day 4 - 12956 votes, 680 users
Day 5 - 13731 votes, 816 users
Day 6 (in progress) - 14799 votes, 1005 users</p>
<p>As can be seen, each day has had quite a bit of increased turnout over the previous day and the trend doesn&#39;t seem to be stopping. This has brought around the very real problem of girls in the first day suddenly having very low vote counts compared to those in the later days.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s where math comes in.</p>
<p>To help normalize all the votes against each other, each girl has her votes calculated as a percentage of her day&#39;s votes. This is then applied against the day that had the highest number of votes:</p>
<p>adjusted = round((characterVotes / dayVotes) * maxVotes);</p>
<p>(Yes, I&#39;m aware that those extra parenthesis are superfluous thanks to order of operations)</p>
<p>So, now each girl can be correctly ranked against how well she did within her own group and not just as an overall sum.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6LPypdD.jpg" alt="" title="Math is fun when it&#39;s fun."></p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Anime Bracket, My Other Full-time Job</h2><time>October 28, 2013</time><div><p>Last Saturday, the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/">2013 Awwnime Girls Bracket</a> opened for business for the second year. The first phase of the brackets always sucks because it means a lot of tedious labor for me.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consists of people nominating the characters they&#39;d like to see make it to the actual voting. This year, I put a lot of additional rules in place, limiting the time span from which somebody could enter a character. This was done to give new characters a fighting change, keep things fresh, and also (hopefully) shrink the pool.</p>
<p>Well, that didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>As of me writing this, three days into the seven day long nomination period, there have been over 1500 nominations. I have had to go through each and every one of those and, for the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-girls-bracket/characters/">830 nominees that were eligible and not duplicates</a>, clean up the name and create a thumbnails. A few things have made this slightly easier this year than last.</p>
<ul>
<li>Better admin tools</li>
<li>A requirement that the user provide an image of the character so I don&#39;t have to go hunting for one</li>
<li>A type-ahead field that pulls data from <a href="http://myanimelist.com">MyAnimeList</a> that will prefill character name, media source, and image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MAL images always come in a 225x350 size, so I&#39;ve gotten the cropping down to muscle memory; I can complete an entrants record in under 10 seconds. Which is good, because even at ten seconds per, that&#39;s over two hours of solid work. But, the average is much higher because I still sometimes need to find a better picture, figure out if the character is eligible if I&#39;m not familiar with the source, etc and so forth. I&#39;ve probably put five to six hours into just cropping those fucking pictures.</p>
<p>But, still, I&#39;m happy with the turn out. To give you a bit of comparison, last year when there were no restricting rules, there were a total of 797 nominations of which 473 made it into the elimination rounds. I suspect part of that is due to the fact that this bracket is starting out with the traction we had at the end of the last one. But also, a lot of people are just nominating every female character from their favorite shows, regardless of how much actual screen time they may have had. I personally think this is a silly approach because only 256 characters will make it to the actual bracket and those will all be the heavy hitter characters. I mean, who seriously thinks that <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/z4.jpg">this</a> will win against <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/ln.jpg">this</a> on a battle based upon cuteness?</p>
<p>Not me, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

Despite not having words, I still know the scripts and could complete these.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Like Tears In Rain</h2><time>October 19, 2013</time><div><p>In trying to come up with a topic for today&#39;s post, I decided I&#39;d post about the entertainment I&#39;ve purchased and have yet to see to completion. It&#39;s become a bad habit for sure.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ovHy1omh.jpg" alt="" title="Staxxx of anime"></p>
<p>On the left is the pile of shows I&#39;ve seen, but not from the versions I&#39;ve purchased. To be fair, the Lucky Star and Haruhi boxes were double dips; I already owned the complete series sets, but Amazon was selling the big ones for $3 (thanks for going out of business, Bandai). On the right are the shows I&#39;ve seen only partially or not at all. A bunch of it I got during RightStuf&#39;s Christmas sale last year (I&#39;m a sucker for deals).</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mje5.jpg" alt="" title="Don&#39;t play games with my heart"></p>
<p>Moving on to games, there are far less than the above movies/anime. Granted, this doesn&#39;t take into account my Steam collection. Still, a few items here fall into &quot;haven&#39;t completed on this particular media&quot; category, namely the Famicom games. Lego Indiana Jones I only purchased to hack my Wii U, so I doubt I&#39;ll ever play that at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8PTyXBgh.jpg" alt="" title="Books, check &#39;em out!"></p>
<p>You may recall some of these from my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/unjacking-from-the-matrix-an-experiment/">no internet experiment</a> last year. Well, many have gone unread and more have been added since. The Haganai book I only got a couple days ago, so perhaps that one counts less. Making matters worse, however, is the enormous stack of Japanese literature I&#39;ve acquired for that magical day when I can comprehend the language. I can <em>read</em> most of these (when there are furigana for the kanji), but I can&#39;t understand 99.97% of them. I have leafed through them all a fair amount, though, and a couple are really only art books.</p>
<p>So, it appears I have a problem pouring money into my hobbies and then not actually following up on them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this should be my new years challenge... to have done <em>before</em> 2014...</p>

</div></article><article><h2>OS X - Six Years Later</h2><time>October 17, 2013</time><div><p>About six and a half years ago, I wrote a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-word-on-the-state-of-apple/">review of my opinions on OS X</a>, then version 10.3 (Tiger). At some point, I dropped trying to struggle through using OS X and moved back to Windows. But, now that I find myself in a work environment that uses Apple&#39;s operating system and have been using it on a daily basis for three or four months (I initially was working on my RedHat machine), it&#39;s time to revisit this. I&#39;ve changed as a computer user, and the version number has incremented five times, so surely the outcome is different. Despite my hatred for Apple&#39;s attitude as a company, I will try to make this as objective as possible.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-i-love">Stuff I Love</h2>
<p><strong>The Terminal</strong> - The best part of OS X is having a Unix terminal at its core. I was not very Linux savvy seven years ago, and even bitched about the folder structure in my initial review. While all those directories with periods in front of them can get annoying (and you know I have finder set to show them), I have no qualms moving about in a command line world. In fact, I prefer it in a lot of cases, especially since I remote into machines basically all of the time.</p>
<p><strong>The Apple Mouse</strong> - Not an OS X feature, per se, but I always thought this thing looked stupid retarded, mainly for the lack of buttons. But, I have to cave on this one and say that in the short time I&#39;ve been using it, I&#39;ve become addicted to the extra functionality you get with the touch surface. Scroll vertically and horizontally, swipe left/right to go back/forward in the browser, two fingers to switch spaces, and most importantly, right and left clicks are recognized. I really only have two complaints about this thing: there&#39;s no middle click and the double two finger tap to bring up expose only work about half the time, making that almost unusable.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-that-drives-me-up-a-tree">Stuff That Drives Me Up a Tree</h2>
<p><strong>Finder</strong> - For all intents and purposes, Finder hasn&#39;t changed much since OS5 (except now it&#39;s in color). My biggest complaints are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still can&#39;t sort leaving directories at the top (pet peeve number 1 about all of OS X)</li>
<li>No visible-by-default address bar. As I was writing this post and dicking around with the Finder preferences, I did discover the &quot;path bar&quot; and a path dropdown which make me a little bit happier. The path bar is similar to Vista and up&#39;s bread-crumb address bar (which I really didn&#39;t like at launch), but is actually for visual info only and has no interaction. Still, in finding the settings pane, I eliminated a couple of items on this list.</li>
<li>Keyboard support still sucks (can&#39;t delete by pressing delete, can&#39;t cut a file at all)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Application Management</strong> - The one thing that really annoys me about the dock is in its inability to let me see at a glance what I have open. Yes, I know what applications are running, but when you have multiple windows open, that can&#39;t be gauged at all. There is expose, and I&#39;ve tried to get into the habit of using that, but it&#39;s still frustrating to move my mouse down to the dock, click my application, and never get the window I was expecting. This action <em>should</em> bring back the last window to have focus, but I don&#39;t even know what the logic is. For example, when I click Chrome, it always goes to my instance of Chrome running the music page in another space (virtual desktop, whatever they call that shit). It&#39;s super annoying.</p>
<p><strong>Window Management</strong> - Clicking the maximize button and not having my application take up the entire screen, but whatever portion of the screen it deems it needs is annoying. There&#39;s a way around this by holding shift, so technically that base is covered. However, the window doesn&#39;t stick there. In messing with tabs in Chrome, sometimes I&#39;ll accidentally move the entire window by some pixels and, because it thinks it&#39;s maximized, I can&#39;t do the shift click trick again to force it back into the viewport proper. That&#39;s something that&#39;s plagued OS X for as long as I&#39;ve been using it. The other thing that bugs me is how awesome Windows 7 suddenly got at managing windows, particularly the snapping stuff. Drag a chrome tab to the top of the screen, it would full screen on that viewport (something I do all the time in multi-monitor setups). Make a window take up all the vertical height it can by resizing the top or bottom edge to the top or bottom of the viewport, something I did with Skype all the time. I never realize how awesome that shit is until it&#39;s gone, like when I was at Winnercomm and all we had were XP machines.</p>
<p><strong>Calendar</strong> - This is another Vista/7 thing that I got used to, but when you click on the time in the task tray, you&#39;re given a fully functional calendar. I would often use this to figure out what day a date was in the future, across months or years. OS X&#39;s date just gives me view options. If I open up the date and time preferences, I can see the currently calendar month but can&#39;t pan through them because auto updating is enabled. Yet another feature that I didn&#39;t realize I had become so reliant on until it was gone.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard</strong> - As my final complaint, a couple things relating to the keyboard. First of all, those fucking symbols. Just say command, shift, option, or control for god&#39;s sake instead of having things that look like foreign currency characters. Last item is the home and end keys. Now, I was able to adjust some obscure ass setting to get these keys to move to the beginning/end of a line which makes them ~80% usable again, but the other use case was Ctl+Home/End to move to the beginning/end of a document (which were their initial assigned functions in OS X).</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s my updated rant about OS X. It may seem like I have a lot of complaints, but they&#39;re really all minor annoyances that jam up a workflow I&#39;ve spent years crafting. I&#39;m doing my best to retrain myself to native ways around these problems, but old habits die hard with a vengeance and even at that, there&#39;s not always a solution. Still, in retraining myself, I&#39;ve taken to a couple of concepts very quickly, namely the aforementioned mouse and spaces. Both of these have become muscle memory in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Concluding, I don&#39;t hate OS X. I&#39;m just as productive in it as I am in Windows. There are just a lot of hiccups regarding learned behaviours that, when given enough of them, really get on my nerves.</p>

<p>This Sunday, I&#39;ll be flying back out to Florida to encourage the fresh minds at my alma mater that working at LinkedIn is pretty cool and a thing they should do. Part of that encouragement is in the form of a presentation I must give. A part of that presentation is an introduction of myself. I&#39;ve gone through a couple revisions, based off of feedback from the good folks organizing the effort, but it&#39;s been mixed. Say more about yourself and your journey and less about LinkedIn. Oh, now say a bit less. It&#39;s slightly maddening.</p>
<p>But, I don&#39;t really need to do any of this. After all, it&#39;s all been done before...</p>

<p>It was a thing despised by most, and rightfully so. Very little good generally came of war; death, destruction, and various other negative words in the same vein. But, to Edgar Smith, war was a thing to be embraced, welcomed into the home like a friend not seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Because war meant business.</p>
<p>Even from a young age, Edgar had always show an interest in black smithing. Perhaps it was destiny, his last being Smith after all. He&#39;d apprenticed under Old Man Jenkins through his adolescence and opened his own shop at seventeen, a thing that even the most experienced men in the field could not brag. From his shop came the most incredible items the town had seen, everything from chairs to wall lamps. Life was good and business thrived.</p>
<p>And then the South decided that owning slaves was something to fight over and war broke out.</p>
<p>If business was good before, it was great now. Orders were coming in by the horse load. Muskets needed to be made, and bullets to go with them. Horses needed shoes and wagons needed wheels. Overnight, Edgar went from modest silverware maker to rich arms dealer. He didn&#39;t care what side came to him, either; their money was good anywhere. Yes, the hours grew longer, but so did the piles of cash and even when a ship date slipped, he didn&#39;t worry. He crafted the most reliable guns in America and that was something that customers would wait an extra day or two for.</p>
<p>Life was good and it was only getting better.</p>
<p>Late one evening, there was a loud knock at Edgar&#39;s shop door. Startled, he whirled around but never even had the chance to open it.</p>
<p>He was dead.</p>
<p>Run through by a gunstick he&#39;d been pleasuring himself in the ass with.</p>

<p>On Boat Day(TM), aka the day where I was drunk for ~14 hours straight, the finale of the evening was at some shady looking Mexican restaurant in a part of San Francisco I was unfamiliar with. Not that I would&#39;ve known where I was anyways, I had just had something called an &quot;Aviator&quot; (it was alright, iirc). But while I was there, I had quite possibly the most delicious hunk of Americanized Mexican food of all time. Today - utilizing all my available means of free transportation - I sought that place back out, a certain <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?authuser=0#!q=El+Farlito+Bar&amp;amp;amp;amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d5512!2d-122.4179414!3d37.7523817!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x808f7e474d4864e5%3A0xd8b448aadf21925!3m8!1m3!1d5546!2d-121.8337824!3d37.2942532!3m2!1i2560!2i1342!4f13.1!4m2!3d37.752696!4d-122.418371">El Farolito</a>, to see if it was just the drunkenness or if it really was that good. I took the scenic route getting there, so begins my visual tale.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xAPZxT2h.jpg" alt="" title="Getting off at the 22nd street Caltrain station with a hugh freeway above my head"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hOChVMYh.jpg" alt="" title="Google told me to go up this hill... so I did"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s6ZJfZ7h.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up this hill with railway tie stairs"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/n8E55yvh.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up these stairs..."></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aftp40Mh.jpg" alt="" title="...and then up several 45 degree streets until I got to the top with a very impressive view of the city"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NeSQlALh.jpg" alt="" title="Saw this on the way. Not sure what&#39;s going on..."></p>
<p>And so, after much trekking and a lot of cursing the people who built their city on a fucking cliff, I arrived at the promised land. And let me tell you, that burrito was just as awesome as I was hoping it&#39;d be. And super cheap too, only ~$7 for the burrito and a Sprite.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o6vcqwS.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s only 5000 calories"></p>
<p>I debated at this point whether I should literally walk the ten steps down to BART for my return trip or walk back home and attempt to exercise off the guilt. I chose the latter and I&#39;m kind of glad I did. I didn&#39;t realize it on the initial part of the trip, but I&#39;d had my back to the bay the entire time. So as I summited the last hill, I was greeted with a rather picturesque sight.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ctGQWM9h.jpg" alt="" title="In my city by the baaEEaaayyy"></p>
<p>San Francisco is run down, shit covered, piss scented, creepy bitch of a city, but if you find the right spots, it can be downright beautiful. Still...</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Before J.J. Abrams, I was going to make Star Wars VII</h2><time>October 11, 2013</time><div><p>Fresh out of things to post about, I decided to poke around the darker regions of my backup drive in search of some old material I could use. Apparently, my debut into Star Wars fanfic was not with homoeroticism, but an old screenplay for a Star Wars film I wanted to make somewhere in the early 2000s. Actually, I have <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/moving-on-03/">an old blog post</a> that mentions it. Still, it turns out that this is a complete thing which I don&#39;t honestly remember doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPipvPckL7JZSw2NFFd_HJ7q1A0sHEK-gkDSeBkVE9I">READ IT NOW</a></p>
<p>On the whole, the level of writing is above what I would have expected of myself at the time, but is entirely juvenile... sad considering I was 16 or 17 years old. It&#39;s full of references to other things both Star Wars and not, a typical naive fanfic trope. Still, the Calvin and Hobbes reference got a good chuckle out of me and, while silly, there were a couple of jokes that made me smirk. Not to say that any of this is good, it&#39;s completely shitty, but I can derive joy in that shittiness. Some, anyways. It&#39;s obvious I was living out some sort of fantasy through Jacen, [one of] the character[s] I was going to play, which is mildly disconcerting.</p>
<p>How I thought I was going to film this with no budget, no equipment, no software, and three actors (myself included), I don&#39;t know. Didn&#39;t stop me from rendering up some 3D stuff.</p>
<p>Sadly (or perhaps, fortunately), that has all been lost to the annals of time.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>The Watchings</h2><time>October 9, 2013</time><div><p>I have nothing better to talk about than the things I am watching, either actively or are just stuck in the middle of. So, whatever.</p>
<h2 id="normal-shows">Normal Shows</h2>
<p><strong>Breaking Bad</strong> - Currently somewhere in season 2. Everybody lost their shit over this show and, while I certainly think it&#39;s well written, it hasn&#39;t quite gotten to the &quot;gripping&quot; part for me yet. Also, the episodes are so long and deep that it&#39;s a hard one to marathon.</p>
<p><strong>Parks and Rec</strong> - Basic sitcom, and a humorous one at that. Unlike Breaking Bad, I could watch this all day. Light and fluffy.</p>
<p><strong>Star Trek (TOS)</strong> - I&#39;m somewhere down at the end of the first season and it&#39;s been entertaining so far. Despite the rocky start it&#39;s had trying to flesh out that universe, the core stories feel very Trek.</p>
<h2 id="anime">Anime</h2>
<p>The new season just started, and I don&#39;t want to give away too much of my opinions for the end-of-year reviews, so I&#39;ll keep this brief.</p>
<p><strong>Kyoukai no Kanata</strong> - The new KyoAni show, so obviously I have to watch. They&#39;ve been on kind of a fantasy/mystery kick lately and this falls right in line with that.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Time</strong> - Some college harem show. The first episode was pretty abysmal, but I&#39;ll stick around for the second to see if it improves and where they go with the cliffhanger ending.</p>
<p><strong>Little Busters Refrain</strong> - I enjoyed the first season enough to watch the second. It&#39;s Key, so generally that means emotionally manipulative stuff even if it&#39;s not being expertly executed by KyoAni.</p>
<p><strong>Nagi no Asukara</strong> - Interesting show about fish humans. I have a super weak spot for oceany type things, and the visuals hit that spot with a jack hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Kill la Kill</strong> - From the guys who brought you Gurren Lagann, another crazy ass, stylized action show.</p>
<p>So, yeah. There&#39;s my post for the day.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Fates Conspired Against My Better Treadmill Entertainment</h2><time>October 8, 2013</time><div><p>This evening, I went out to grab my mail and, as I was walking that way, noticed that the gym was empty. Having not done my biking the last couple days as should have happened, I decided that a quick jog on the treadmill would be beneficial (especially since the scale is tipping down again).</p>
<p>After quick journey back to the apartment to grab my iPad and shoes, I made my way back towards the gym where I would mooch off some wifi and catch some Parks and Rec courtesy of Netflix. Except that the wifi is either moles asses slow or just plain doesn&#39;t work, because I walked in place in front of a red screen loading for a couple minutes before giving up.</p>
<p>No matter, just about every machine in that room is wired up with cable. Flicking on the TV, I waited through a few commercials to see what channel I was on. Turns out it was the Food Network and it was showing Chopped, one of those god awful reality shows that the former cooking show channel likes to play these days. Because god forbid we&#39;re not entertained by shallow, scripted-through-editing shit TV instead of being educated on how to woo women with succulent dishes. Yes, I&#39;m a little sore that every channel that had mildly educational stuff has gone over to this format (looking at you Discovery Channel, History Channel, The Learning Channel).</p>
<p>But, whatever. I could just change the channel. Except, the channel changing buttons wouldn&#39;t actually change anything. They clearly were doing <em>something</em> because the OSD would come up with the current station number, but it would actually change. At this point, I should have turned off the TV. But I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>I walked/jogged as hippies tried to cook chickens feet for a Halloween themed dish.</p>
<p>Goddammit...</p>

<p>I&#39;m saddened that the red squigglies went away after correcting my spelling of &quot;hashtag&quot;...</p>
<p>Sometimes when you&#39;re coding a website, you&#39;ll have something in markup that is represented in text for accessibility, but needs to be graphical in presentation. Oftentimes, this will happen for a logo or an icon of some sort. The industry standard way of hiding the text but not the image is to use text-indent to move the text somewhere off the left side of the screen while setting a background.</p>
<p>That last part is fine, the other part is not.</p>
<p>When you text-indent something -9999px offscreen, you&#39;re really fucking up the internal render dimensions of the item for the browser. Some dude from Netflix explained more about this on a talk he gave about fixing performance issues on mobile, but I&#39;ll be damned if I can find it now. The short of it is, it&#39;s bad practice, bad for performance, and you shouldn&#39;t do it. But, there&#39;s a nifty, cross-browser friendly way to have your cake without resorting to ugly hacks like text-indent.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I can&#39;t take any credit for any of this. I picked it up from my pal Mickael Lucchini during my first tenure at Griffin. However, I have yet to see this trick used or mentioned anywhere else on the internet, so it needs to be shared.</p>
<p>[code=css].image-text {
display: [block|inline-block];
height: 0;
padding-top: 10px;
width: 10px;
overflow: hidden;
background: url(BACKGROUND_IMAGE);
}[/code]</p>
<p>A quick description of what&#39;s going on:</p>
<p><strong>Line 2</strong> - obviously, seeing as we need to set a height and width, we need a block level element
<strong>Line 3</strong> - we zero out the height of the element to force the content out of the renderable area
<strong>Line 4</strong> - instead, we set our height on the padding which gives the element height and allows the background to show through
<strong>Line 5</strong> - width is set as normal
<strong>Line 6</strong> - because our element height is 0, setting the overflow to hidden will hide the text content within
<strong>Line 7</strong> - finally, set the background, probably a sprite or something</p>
<p>There you have it. Probably the best way to image replace text in a performant and browser friendly way (back to IE6, if I&#39;m not mistaken). If you inspect the search icon up in the corner, you can see this code in action (not sure why the input box is off, but that&#39;s something for another day). Also, if you&#39;re into SASS, here&#39;s a handy mixin I made of the above:</p>
<p>[code=css]@mixin image-text($background, $width, $height, $display: block) {
  overflow: hidden;
  width: $width;
  height: 0;
  padding-top: $height;
  display: $display;
  background: $background no-repeat;
}[/code]</p>

<p>Sometime in the mid 90s (I&#39;m inclined to say 1996), garage sale-ing was a popular past time for middle class Americans. It might still be, but I haven&#39;t been in forever. Seems like it&#39;d be fun. But, I digress.</p>
<p>As stated, somewhere in (probably) 1996, we hit up a garage sale a few blocks up from our house. To my kid mind, it was probably the greatest garage sale ever, for there was a veritable treasure trove of old NES games. We wound up leaving that garage sale with three games (and <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/NINTENDO-NES-LOT-OF-10-PLASTIC-HARD-GAME-CASES-/370907101629">some extra cases</a>), one was Gauntlet II, one was some other game I can&#39;t remember, and the third was Star Trek: 25th Anniversary. I grew up on a steady diet of Next Generation growing up, but somehow I was aware of what the original series was and the characters in it. Granted, anything with the name Star Trek in it had to be cool, so I was excited.</p>
<p>And enjoy it I did. It became one of the very few games I played to completion on our old machine, a fact that I was proud of at the time. So, as I&#39;ve been slowly watching TOS at the behest of my boss boss boss, I remembered this game and the feeling of enjoying it quite much. A quick trip to eBay, and I found not only a copy, but a copy with box and manual. That&#39;s a big deal for one who has the tendencies of a collector. For once, though, I actually played the game instead of let it sit and collect dust. And now that I&#39;m done with my long ass intro, the review.[break]</p>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XrLsxyk.png" alt="" title="Space... the final frontier..."></p>
<p>The game opens with our intrepid explorers getting sucked into a wormhole or something and thrown out into the other side of the Romulan Neutral Zone. Pretty standard Star Trek fare. About half the game is devoted to getting enough dilithium to go anywhere, and the other half about the anomaly itself. All in all, it&#39;s a pretty short game.</p>
<p>The setup for play is very similar to the old point-and-click adventures of yore, such as those made by Sierra or LucasArts. When on the Enterprise, you get to see out the view screen, talk to various officers, jump around from planet to planet, or beam down to the one you are currently orbiting. In one section, you even battle a Romulan Bird of Prey. When on a planet&#39;s surface, you roam around collecting items, talking to natives, and &quot;tricordering&quot; things. It&#39;s a pretty basic setup that controls well enough given the platform.</p>
<p>One thing that I particularly enjoyed - especially after having been watching the show - was the writing. The dialog for each character is inline with what they&#39;d say in the show, down to Spock&#39;s oft use of &quot;fascinating&quot; or Bones&#39; complaining that he isn&#39;t a <insert profession here>. On top of that characters, locales, and even story lines are revisited from the show. The Gorn and Harry Mudd both make an appearance, and (spoiler alert) the entire plot line of the game hinges on the ending of <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/A_Piece_of_the_Action_(episode">&quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;</a>). They even slingshot around a sun to go back in time, a not so subtle nod to my favorite TOS movie, <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek_IV:_The_Voyage_Home">The Voyage Home</a>. The cherry on top is the ending where Spock and Bones are standing around the captain&#39;s chair as Spock says something profoundly illogical but tries to play it off. Good shit.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fHvggU8.png" alt="" title="GORNY"></p>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Cro5nvy.png" alt="" title="Spock. Myy... arm! Is so... TINY!"></p>
<p>Given the limited abilities of the NES in terms of graphics, I have to give props to this game for both conveying the feel of the Star Trek sets while also pulling off a couple of nifty technical feats. One in particular had me scratching my head a bit, knowing what I know about the NES hardware thanks to the knowledge I picked up while writing my emulator.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6HL1gAw.png" alt="" title="Just another desolate planet"></p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to overlook if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking for, but Kirk is standing in front of the shrubbery and behind the rocks. Unlike the SNES, the NES only had one background layer and a sprite could be flagged as in front of or behind that one background layer. When I first noticed this I was all &quot;what is this devilry?&quot; The simple answer would be that the items in front of Kirk were just sprites pretending to be the background, but a lack of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Limitations#Fighting">sprite flicker</a> quickly rules that out. What they must be doing is paying very close attention to where each &quot;subsprite&quot; of the player sprite is in relation to the background (I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re running in 8x16 sprite mode), and setting that part above/below the background as needed. It&#39;s a pretty clever way to add some depth.</p>
<p>But, all is not sunshine and roses, despite the cleverness. The limitations of the 2C02 come blazing forth, with slowdown when there are too many sprites on screen, or the aforementioned flicker when Jim and his buddies are all standing on the same scanline. Some of the static characters look a little bit &quot;muddy&quot; and don&#39;t stand out too well from the background at times. But, they&#39;re trying to make something &quot;realistic&quot; out of a super limited palette, so I can let these instances slide.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/voZh0Cu.png" alt="" title="Spock seems to be smiling..."></p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>You have to give credit to anybody that can create a good chiptune. The guys at Capcom had it down to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF32DRg9opA">fucking science</a>. Granted, creating an original score is a lot simpler than trying to arrange an existing piece for a few triangle waves, a square, and a noise channel. Still, it can be done <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roHje14-K44">with great success.</a> This game, while it does incorporate themes and background tunes from the show, tends to be very barebones and the loops are super short. The gangster theme in particular gets really annoying pretty quickly. But, you have to give them props for keeping it &quot;in the family&quot;, as it were.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not ten anymore and am not so easily amused as I once was, but I feel that this game has actually held up really well. You can tell that the guys who made it had a great deal of respect for the source material, ensuring that the characters and story telling that we all have come to know and love were represented as accurately as possible. Yes, the game is short (about four-five hours), the music could be better, and there were a couple instances where figuring out what to do next was a bit tricky (GameFaqs was on tap a couple times), but I genuinely enjoyed revisiting this game some seventeen years after first being introduced to it. That I&#39;m now more familiar with the series now only makes it even better.</p>
<p>You should take some notes, J.J. Abrams. THIS is how to write a love letter to the 23rd century.</p>

All in all, it was a roaring success.</p>
<h2 id="code-changes">Code Changes</h2>
<p>On the whole, I had developed out the system to be fairly robust on the user facing side by the end of the last bracket. The only real issue remaining there was that the bracket overview was a set of enormous images. This year I fixed that by rendering everything client side as a standard page, with a tiny bit of interactivity sprinkled in (that&#39;s what I linked above). The real work was done on the backend, moving all the administrative code into the model/controllers and out of CLI scripts I had quickly hammered out. That part was an absolute godsend because all I had to do was login and click &quot;advance bracket&quot;. Granted, this could be done on a cron job, but I have to be present to write the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1nts6x/2013_boys_bracket_and_the_winner_is/">recap post</a> anyways. Also, there were almost no technological hiccups this year which made everything so much less stressful.</p>
<h2 id="curbing-abuse">Curbing Abuse</h2>
<p>Last year, there were some groups of users hell bent on getting their character voted in no matter the cost. Because of the rush I was in to get the code out the door, the system was pretty easy to get around in terms of flooding votes. All votes were tied to IP, so you could either get friends to help, go to the library and vote again, or just power cycle your phone. Because everything was IP based, I can&#39;t say how much abuse there was, but I suspect there was a fair amount.</p>
<p>This year, everything was tied to reddit user accounts, using OAuth for authentication. A user would have to have a valid account and that account needed to be at least a month old. I still recorded IPs with the registrations to keep track of multiple users under a single IP. Out of the 660 users who voted, only about a dozen had more than one user to an IP and never more than two. So, another big win.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SLrruty.jpg" alt="" title="An upward trend"></p>
<p>In all, 19841 votes were cast and daily views (seen above) were in the hundreds per day. This really doesn&#39;t even hold a candle to the bracket last year which had ~264000 votes and thousands of views per day. Now, the vote thing can be partially attributed to the above abuse but also the fact that that bracket ran a lot longer. It was 256 characters as opposed to 64. Still, I&#39;m pleased with the turnout. Most voting happend at 5a CDT at 11% of all votes, 6a came in second with 7%, and 2p and 3p were tied for third with 5%. 3a was the quietest time at 2%.</p>
<p>In all, running this bracket was pretty stress free and very much enjoyable. Granted, I wasn&#39;t totally invested being a heterosexual male. But still, everybody else seemed to enjoy it as well and what shit slinging there was was conducted in a civil manner.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not so optimistic for the girls bracket which starts in three weeks...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Edge Cases</h2><time>October 4, 2013</time><div><p>I&#39;m grasping at straws on what I should post, especially given that I have thirty minutes to write something. I thought I was doing well by actually <em>having</em> a post whereas my dear sweet mother had not, but a quick check reveals <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2013/10/oh-crap-i-have-to-write-another-post/">that she&#39;s on top of her game</a>, probably with quality.</p>
<p>Browsing through my pictures folder, I came across a few things involving redditbooru&#39;s reverse image search. At this point, the thing is an essential tool for the /r/awwnime sub, and when it doesn&#39;t work, I get notified. I&#39;ve <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">mentioned before</a> that the image analysis is entirely color based, no edge or corner detection or anything like that. So, when somebody brings up something and my human mind is all &quot;huh, it seems like that should have matched&quot;, I&#39;m invariably sent down a rabbit hole of figuring shit out.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhf9.jpg" alt="" title="Taiga..."></p>
<p>This was the first one I had to deeply investigate. The one on the left was the original, repost on the right. It should be noted that the right picture was also animated. The images are squashed because all images are resized to 256x256 to help normalize things, especially useful for taking into account resized pictures. But, the image search failed to pick up on this for a couple reasons: A) the gif is ever so slightly brighter, probably due to the color quantization. Actually, that&#39;s really the only thing. The ever so slight facial expression difference would almost certainly be picked up if the color space was the same.</p>
<p>We had some discussion on the thread about whether testing against greyscale would be any help, but the difference was enough that it didn&#39;t bring the matches any closer.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhfa.jpg" alt="" title="Skyfaaaaall"></p>
<p>This one was fun. The above picture is the original, the repost I have no idea where it is, but I have some explanation images.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhfb.jpg" alt="" title="Slight differences"></p>
<p>The left side in this case is the repost and you can tell that there are some slight differences in both form and colors, certainly enough to throw off the image search. What I had trouble wrapping my mind around was that these were clearly two different images, but which one was the original and why was there one slightly different.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/mhfc.png" alt="" title="Overlayed comparison"></p>
<p>Turns out, the slightly shittier left version (not saying it&#39;s shitty, it&#39;s certainly kicking my ass and most of my other body parts at art) was somebody copying the original in an attempt to improve their art skills.</p>
<p>That&#39;s cool. I&#39;ve been there too.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Are the robots getting smarter?</h2><time>October 2, 2013</time><div><p>I was going to talk about how I used nodejs to move redditbooru off of crontab and prevent crazy CPU spikes I was seeing, but then I received this crazy recruiter email that I&#39;m still wrapping my mind around. Ever since I made the jump to Winnercomm, I&#39;ve been bombarded by a goodly number of people trying to recruit me every month. Since moving to the Valley, nothing&#39;s changed except now the companies are ones I&#39;ve heard of. But today... I received perhaps one of the more bizarre ones I&#39;ve seen yet:</p>
<p>[b]SUBJECT: You&#39;re an anime fan - I am Monica w/ [Redacted] :)[/b]</p>
<p>[quote]Hi Matt,</p>
<p>I am Monica, a community manager at [Redacted], a platform for finding companies that fit you. I saw that you&#39;re an anime fan-- what are your favorite shows? Are you watching anything good right now? I just finished watching Free! and really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Also I saw that you worked at LinkedIn and did web development on the LinkedIn profile pages, emails, and horizontal JS framework migration efforts. That’s awesome! But, if you are ready for something new (along with a 25%+ salary bump) we know that JobVite needs help doing JS development along with Java backend services development. You may not have direct experience with that but I saw that you were endorsed for Java on LinkedIn and I thought it would be worth asking. :)</p>
<p>[Redacted corporate shill because they don&#39;t get free advertisement from me]</p>
<p>If I bothered you and you don&#39;t want to be contacted in the future, let me know and I will make sure we don&#39;t reach out again. I will also be happy to say I am sorry with a beer (we are partial to porters) or a coffee (black!) :) [/quote]</p>
<p>This has all the hallmarks of being both a handwritten letter and also one generated by a cold and unfeeling robot (though, being the Bay Area, probably a sexy one).</p>
<p>So it opens up by declaring I am an anime fan, not something like &quot;I see that you&#39;re an anime fan&quot;, just &quot;YOU ARE ANIME FAN!&quot; This is not untrue, but probably the oddest way to open a recruiting email I&#39;ve yet seen. I had originally written a sentence here about how people would know I like anime (blog/reddit account), but it&#39;s essentially plastered all over my LinkedIn profile. Still, stranger than the fact that anime was the opener was the fact that a super recent show was mentioned (<a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/free-iwatobi-swim-club">Free!</a> just wrapped its twelve episode run last Thursday).</p>
<p>Okay, one point for not being a bot. But that all comes into question with the first sentence of paragraph two where basically every word is lifted <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mhackmann">right out of my profile</a>. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Verbatim_diskette_(2">Verbatim</a>.jpg). That&#39;s super bot like (or incredibly lazy). The rest of the paragraph is too well crafted to be a bot, especially the mention of the Java endorsement (which has a story behind it that I find rather humorous).</p>
<p>The damning piece of evidence against this being a robot (outside of the fact that it was obviously written by a human), is that GMail was kind enough to link to her Google+ account in the right rail. And, I must say, I like what I see. If what she&#39;s saying about anime and the various other nerd type things she posts on her... whatever Google+ calls a &quot;wall&quot;... are true, perhaps I should take her up on that beer/coffee offer.</p>
<p>That <em>date</em> will have nothing to do with future employment.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>PHP, Events, and the Ajax Pipeline</h2><time>October 1, 2013</time><div><p>Working at LinkedIn, I feel almost required to talk about coding on my blog, especially if I want to keep my <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8ALLwfP.jpg">Junior Woodchuck Engineer</a> sash.</p>
<p>Some months ago, I was trying to beef up the user feedback that <a href="http://awwnime.redditbooru.com/">redditbooru</a> would give when making requests to the server. One thing I wanted to do was, during a reverse image lookup, have a continually updating status to the user. &quot;Retrieving image&quot;, &quot;Searching database&quot;, and then the final data. This required a couple of interesting things: implementing an event model in PHP, and the not-so-talked-about third readyState value in the XMLHttpRequest response: 3, or &quot;processing request&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="php-eventing">PHP Eventing</h2>
<p>Anybody who has coded JavaScript for more than thirty minutes will understand that it runs on a highly evented model. You attach a listener to an object with a function callback, the object fires and event, and the callback is called with data provided pertaining to the event in question. PHP, being a highly linear programming language, doesn&#39;t really have such a concept baked in. Being that I wanted something that could be easily reused through out an entire project, I came up with a stupid simple <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/lib/events.php">events library</a>. Pertaining to the internal event modelling, it exposes the following two methods:</p>
<p>[code=php]public static function addEventListener($eventType, $callback);
public static function fire($eventType, $data = null);[/code]</p>
<p>These work essentially as they do in JavaScript: subscribe to an event with addEventListener and provide a callback. Fire an event with fire of that event type with whatever relevant information that goes with. addEventListener is constructed such that you can add multiple callbacks for a single event, much like the sugary goodness that jQuery provides to the DOM. One possible drawback of my implementation is that the event bus is essentially global, being that all the methods are static. This means you could have naming collisions on event types. Granted, this could easily be converted into an abstract class that any class could later inherit, providing this functionality.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of quick production examples of <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/api/image.php#L215">event firing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/controller/images.php#L199">event subscribing</a>. One half of the puzzle solved.</p>
<h2 id="sending-and-parsing-evented-json">Sending and Parsing Evented JSON</h2>
<p>As stated previously, on modern browsers, the XMLHttpRequest response has a third ready state of &quot;processing request&quot;. Essentially, this fires at certain points as the request is receiving data. We can use this to our advantage to send small status updates to the user as the backend performs numerous/long running tasks. Part of the events library are some calls to handle what I refer to as &quot;evented Ajax&quot;, though I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a real term for it. It has the following methods:</p>
<p>[code=php]public static function beginAjaxEvent();
public static function endAjaxEvent();
public static function sendAjaxEvent($eventType, $data);[/code]</p>
<p>beginAjaxEvent and endAjaxEvent do essentially what you would expect: they prime the system for sending data out in this fashion and tidy everything up necessarily. sendAjaxEvent is where all the fun happens. I&#39;m going to go through this guy line by line.</p>
<p>[code=php]public static function sendAjaxEvent($eventType, $data) {
$out = new stdClass;
$out-&gt;eventType = $eventType;
$out-&gt;data = $data;
$out = json_encode($out);</p>
<p>// Pad out the request to a minimum of 4K for Chrome
if (strlen($out) &lt; 4096) {
$out = str_pad($out, 4096, &#39; &#39;);
}
echo $out;
flush();
}[/code]</p>
<p><strong>Line 3-7</strong> - pretty simple, preparing the data that will actually be sent to the browser as a JSON response.
<strong>Line 8-11</strong> - An oddity I ran into with Chrome while developing this. Apparently, it will only fire a processing event if the data received is 4K or greater. So, to ensure that the event is fired, we pad the response out to 4K at minimum.
<strong>Line 12-13</strong> - spit out the data and flush the buffer to the browser.</p>
<p>For the power this can wield, it&#39;s pretty simple stuff. Of course, you need to be properly set up to receive this type of response on the client end. Being as I&#39;m focusing on the PHP side here, I won&#39;t go into details, but <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/blob/master/view/js/scripts.js#L78">you can check out my implementation</a>. The implementation is fairly tightly coupled with how it&#39;s piped out of PHP, particularly expecting the last and largest data coming down the pipe to be an event named &quot;data&quot;. But, I have yet to receive any user complaints that this doesn&#39;t work, so that&#39;s the important part.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is nice and all, but this particular intrigue of onreadtstatechange isn&#39;t compatible on some browsers (cough, IE, cough). For that, there are fallbacks in place to use a standard Ajax request a la jQuery. By setting &quot;evented&quot; parameter on the URL to the request, the event model can be effectively turned on or off. The internal events are ignored, and what would be sent in the data event becomes the response. It&#39;s a gracefully degrading solution to the issue. Granted, that query string parameter could go away entirely if one was to do user agent sniffing on the backend.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s my little write-up on what was probably an afternoon of coding. I haven&#39;t yet implemented this anywhere else, but I think that at least the events model could have some (or a lot of uses) in many day to day cases, especially if you were to start messing around with multi-threading in PHP.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s a post for another day.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My Plate and the Amount of Stuff On It</h2><time>September 29, 2013</time><div><p>My mom decided to try out my month of one blog per day thing. I couldn&#39;t just take that sitting down, so here I am in a [mother disapproved word removed]-wagging contest, a contest which really doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>I love to talk about how lazy I am. For instance, sometimes when I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;ll just continue being hungry because I don&#39;t want to stare into the cupboards and figure out what to make, or I just don&#39;t want to clean all the required hardware. Or perhaps there&#39;s just no food to be had. Either way, this is a thing that happens and it certainly has all the hallmarks of laziness.</p>
<p>But to say I&#39;m lazy overall isn&#39;t really true. I am selectively lazy. When it comes to programming tasks (or anything computer related, really) I&#39;m always up to something. At the moment, I&#39;m up to a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Work</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on and off all weekend trying to pump out a gratuitous amount of code in a stack that I have no business touching. During one of our team meetings, I set a bar for myself by telling everybody that I would take on a beefy amount of engineering work because I feel I have to prove myself (through many discussions with the people I work with, this is apparently incorrect thinking). That&#39;s actually only part of it; it seemed like a fun challenge. And this has shown to be more or less correct, as I&#39;ve lost some hours just pounding away at the keyboard. The long compile times aren&#39;t fun, but I&#39;ve learned a fuckton of stuff, both about how your <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/conanobrien">LinkedIn profile page</a> is pulled together, but also a bit about Java and a bit more about OOP. Besides, those compile times are easily whiled away by playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_25th_Anniversary_(NES_video_game">Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</a>) game for NES.</p>
<p>On top of that, there&#39;s a presentation I need to write pretty damn soon. I have been chosen to pitch web development at LinkedIn to a throng of up and comings at my alma mater next month. I haven&#39;t even started on that...</p>

<p>Last year&#39;s awwnime bracket only got a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/weekend-of-productivity/">couple</a> of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">nods</a> in the blog despite eating up nearly two solid months of my life. This year it&#39;s coming back, but we&#39;re also running an additional bracket for male characters (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1n5q2t/2013_boys_bracket_round_1_group_a/">which came with it&#39;s own set of problems</a>). In an attempt to make things actually manageable, I spent some time into moving all my one off shell scripts into the code base proper and writing an administrative interface around that. Additionally, I moved away from the money sucking <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me.s3.amazonaws.com/bracket/bracket_round1_groupB.jpg?v7">giant images</a> and switch to something <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-boys-bracket/view/">rendered in browser</a>. It&#39;s also much friendlier to interactiveness that way.</p>
<p><strong>Freelance</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that I keep promising myself I&#39;ll never freelance again, the sweet allure of &quot;free money&quot; is too much. Now, the upside is I haven&#39;t had to bust my ass on any of the one (possible two) projects in the pipeline at this point, but still, they hang over me ling a large, swinging axe.</p>
<p><strong>Other things in the wings</strong></p>
<p>On top of all that, there are still items in the backburner. Fixes/updates to redditbooru, especially the backend service. I majiggered the main part off of a cron job and into a node run task (initially to curb an issue I experienced after upgrading to php 5.5), but now that the code is there, I can multithread that bitch. On top of that, there are changes I&#39;d love to make to the music page, the music page physical controller I&#39;ve been tinkering with, and the iPhone app that I&#39;ve begun writing for it.</p>
<p>My plate is full of computery things for sure, despite what I say about laziness. I&#39;m probably heading straight for a burnout, but these things ebb and flow, and right now they&#39;re just flowing.</p>
<p>I guess you could say I&#39;m on my development period...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>[My] Private Eyes Are Watching You</h2><time>September 8, 2013</time><div><p>A couple weeks back, I was hunting for the keys to the familial house, hoping that I could make my surprise appearance back to the midwest even more so by just showing up in the house. I never found those keys, but as I was digging I came across my old yearbooks from a time when I actually attended school; kindergarten through second grade, to be exact.</p>
<p>As I scanned the names of my old classmates, thoroughly surprised at just how many of them I had forgotten, I thought it would be fun to do a little experiment: see which ones I could track down online with any degree of confidence. Having gone to a rather expensive, private school, there were many kids of some affluence, so I assumed that quite a few of them would turn up. My thinking there being that they&#39;d all have gone to college and made something of themselves.</p>
<h2 id="the-method">The Method</h2>
<p>My method of performing this search was rather simple: open a private window in Chrome (to avoid any &quot;social&quot; cookies set in my normal browsing session), and search &#39;&quot;first last&quot; oklahoma&#39;. Some leads or additional information I knew would sometimes make me change this query, but it nearly always started there. Once I&#39;d perused no more than three pages of search results, I would rank them on my confidence that I had found a person and how prominent or easily they showed up in the search. These were ranked from low to confirmed. I also tried to note where I found them, what they were doing, and any personal remarks that came to mind. I used my second grade class as the data pool, a total of 28 &quot;kids&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>The results are almost entirely not what I expected at all. People I expected to appear easily (due to their prominence in school and/or highly specific names) were nowhere to be found, while people I barely remember existing were quite prominent. A lot can happen in twenty years, I suppose. But number break downs:</p>
<p><strong>Confirmed</strong> - 18%, 5 people
<strong>High</strong> - 21%, 6 people
<strong>Medium</strong> - 4%, 1 person
<strong>Low</strong> - 54%, 15 people
<strong>&quot;Doesn&#39;t Exist&quot;</strong> - 4%, 1 person</p>
<p>My math is off on those percentages, but whatever. By and far, the most common place to find people was on LinkedIn. When you think about it, this makes sense as a person is more likely to use their real name on a place that&#39;s for professional networking. Also, LinkedIn is more public to search engines than, say, Facebook. Seven LinkedIn profiles I found, compared to two Facebook and one Google+ account.</p>
<p>Some of the notes I took (removing the names to protect the innocent):</p>
<p><strong>Female</strong> - lawyer, works in Tulsa on 1st street (literally, about two blocks from my old employer)
<strong>Female</strong> - works for Phillips, just got married
<strong>Male</strong> - politics, got handsome
<strong>Matt Hackmann</strong> - <a href="https://www.tlcvision.com/lasik-reviews-and-news/685/">https://www.tlcvision.com/lasik-reviews-and-news/685/</a> (this has got to be my greatest search result ever)
<strong>Male</strong> - web developer, super hairy
<strong>Female</strong> - doesn&#39;t like commas
<strong>Male</strong> - animator
<strong>Female</strong> - may have written a review for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polgara-Sorceress-Malloreon-David-Eddings/dp/0345422554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1378696304&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=polgara+the+sorceress">Polgara the Sorceress</a>
<strong>Female</strong> - possible felon
<strong>Female</strong> - possibly getting married</p>
<p>Yes, I tossed myself in the list to see how well I would turn up in my search terms. Not the greatest, when you see that the search results are stuffed with white pages type results, and not even well enough to mark myself as confirmed as I couldn&#39;t place myself as having lived in Bartlesville.</p>
<p>That evening, I also found the phone number for an old crush I had at Walmart. I kind of want to use my Grand Central account to text her something creepy (If you are who I think you are, I know you and you know me... or at least, we once did...)</p>
<p>But we all know I can&#39;t approach women.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>RetroReview - Beauty and the Beast</h2><time>August 18, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yYvkSe7.jpg" alt="" title="Beauty and the Beast"></p>
<p>For the first time in what has to be going on twenty years, I took some time this afternoon to watch <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. It probably is in my top three movies in terms of times seen, having played the shit out of it when I was younger, one of those films that I had memorized and would recite nigh constantly. Interestingly enough, most of my memory of the dialog is gone. But, whatever. Review time.</p>
<p>Adapted from some Frenchie story, Beauty and the Beast is a pretty cliche movie about Stockholm Syndrome. Selfish prince is an asshole to the wrong person and gets turned into a beast with the stipulation that he can&#39;t be turned back until he gets somebody to love him. Enter sort of feminist Belle who wings up his prisoner but then realizes <em>hey, maybe he&#39;s not so bad</em>, falls in love with him and cue curtains. Per the fairy tale norm, all of this life changing shit happens in the span of a week, a month at most, and the spell is broken and they fuck like monkeys. It&#39;s super cliche and there&#39;s nothing I can say about this that can&#39;t be leveraged against every other romantic fairy tale in existence. What I want to focus on, being a connoisseur of the subject, are the technical aspects of the movie.</p>
<p>Now, being Disney and given the high regard this movie has, you would expect there to be a certain level of quality. Certainly, the production values are pretty high, but this film was riding on an era that was straddling the line between the animation techniques of yore and the world of modern movie making. My biggest issue with the movie was how out of place Belle (and in the end, the Princified Beast) were compared to the rest of the cast. They were drawn in a manner that closer resembled humans than everybody else (other humans included), who were all rendered in a highly caricatured, cartoon style. And to that point, that style fucking sucks. It had all the problems of the older Disney movies; odd modeling at certain angles, movement that seems not quite natural, and those lips... they&#39;re goddamned humongous and, for whatever reason, aren&#39;t even synced to the voices correctly far too often. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s all my time spent behind anime (which certainly has its ups and downs), but I found these character designs to be meh at best and almost grotesque when off model.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a problem at all with the &quot;cartoon&quot; cast; their features are exaggerated and, as such, we expect their movements to be. To boot, there are some nice little design flairs that parallel their human forms. Lumiere&#39;s cowlick is a little fwip of melted wax, Cogsworth&#39;s clock hands mirror his mustache, and Mrs. Potts&#39; lid is a throwback to her little maid... hat... thing. The way these characters are animated in their non-human form is clever and you can tell the animators had fun with it. Even the Beast&#39;s animation was pulled off exceedingly well, full of lots of subtle nuance particularly in the facial expressions.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s the CG. One of the big &quot;firsts&quot; of the time in this movie was the ballroom dance scene, in which the room was rendered entirely in computers. To say the least, it doesn&#39;t hold up. Sure, those big sweeping camera moves are nice, but the lighting on those pillars makes it looks like a low-budget children&#39;s show from today. You could also tell that a lot of establishing shots were at least put together in a computer, as the parallaxing of layers and panning was far and away too smooth looking for traditional animation. So smooth, in fact, that I almost felt like I was watching the Hobbit at 48fps all over again. The opening scene in particular was a major offender of this.</p>
<p>Oh, and then there&#39;s this...</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.awwni.me/m9xd.gif" alt="" title="Round and round and round..."></p>
<p>There seem to be a lot of people who are entirely undecided on where they want to go...</p>
<p>Concluding, Beauty and the Beast certainly doesn&#39;t hold up as well now that I&#39;m considerably older. It has its entertaining moments for sure, with the pairs of Lumiere and Cogsworth and Gaston and Lefou having the majority of these, but in the end it&#39;s just another Disney fairy tale adaptation with all the cons that come with. You&#39;d think I&#39;d be more into this stuff what with the staggering amount of high school romcoms that I consume on a weekly basis, but these just don&#39;t do it for me.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Those Who Did It Know Their Blame</h2><time>August 11, 2013</time><div><p>I still write &quot;weekly&quot; as a tag for these posts, but we all know the accuracy of that. I should retroactively change it to read &quot;lies&quot;. But, that&#39;s enough self-deprecation for now.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Been hit and miss on the exercise. Last week, I didn&#39;t set foot on the bike at all, excepting on Sunday when I made another trek to <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/72282595">Sausalito via the Golden Gate Bridge</a>. The week before, I was down sick for a couple days and didn&#39;t much bike then either. It&#39;s a mechanical horse that I need to get back on and stay on. In terms of food, not much has changed. I frequent Taco Bell every once and again, and when I don&#39;t eat for supper I&#39;m generally having some nice, fatty comfort food. The call of free sugar treats at work is one I have much trouble ignoring and, more often then not, cave to. Let&#39;s not even mention the alcohol consumption curve since moving here...</p>
<p>So, my goal for this week is to not eat any sweets and place myself on the Matt Hackmann Turkey Sandwich Diet until I can get my poundage back down. The work provided lunches provide me with plenty of calories to ensure that I don&#39;t die on a given day. On top of that, biking to work at least four out of the five work days.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Superfluous spending has subsided some, but the bigger news would be that I have now accomplished two of the three goals I set for myself; paying off my credit card and my LASIK loan. According to the list I presented, that leaves just the car loan. With only four months left in the year, I&#39;m still yet uncertain of the likelihood that I will tackle that one as well. Though, with the money saved from those two bills down, that can certainly hasten the process.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Some evenings when I come home from work, I consider that I should crack out my books and do some studying. But, then I catch myself in the same downward spiral that I do with art; where do I begin and how do I proceed. Interestingly enough, a couple weeks back I received a little brochure about some adult learning programs that the Fremont High School system has in the fall and, lo and behold, Japanese is amoung the courses available. Not only that, but they use the same books that I have already purchased. I feel it would be wise to get in on those, if only to provide initial direction.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Can I Be an Artist?</h2><time>August 2, 2013</time><div><p>Some time ago, I did that stupid <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/picking-the-pencil-back-up/">art instruction school test</a>, just acting like a jack ass because I can&#39;t help but feel that there&#39;s something skeezy going on there. Well, nearly one month later, I get this back:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Oju5QcW.jpg" alt="" title="VERY GOOD!"></p>
<p>85 out of 100, they gave me. There&#39;s apparently a whole bunch of shit that goes into making this &quot;composite score&quot;, namely accuracy, stroke quality, shading and tones, and &quot;design concepts&quot;. I feel I should have gotten a 0 because I broke the one and only rule... draw <strong>one</strong> subject.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m not 100% certain that this wasn&#39;t just rubber stamped on. The sheet I got back was a scan of my original paper, and closely examining the lettering suggests that it was (at some point) handwritten because all the Os are different, but still.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll consider this my control and send in another form under a different <em>nym</em>, but draw something completely off topic, very badly rendered, or perhaps both.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Rule of Twos</h2><time>July 27, 2013</time><div><p>I&#39;m mildly inebriated right now, having partaken in a particularly vicious <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1iqt7z/multiplayer_moe_week_42/">Squid Girl drinking game</a>. Two gin and tonics is enough to get me a little loopy, apparently. But, that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>Last week, as I was biking home from work, I had a bit of a realization; for the last ten year, approximately every two years, my life hits some sort of major stepping stone. Stay with me a moment as we saunter down this alley.</p>
<h2 id="2003">2003</h2>
<p>Probably one of the smaller items on this list, I became an admin of the YPN in late &#39;02/early &#39;03. This saw a very large uptick in my time spent doing web development. From YPNgine to Tetra, it occupied quite a lot of time and is certainly integral to where I am today.</p>
<h2 id="2005">2005</h2>
<p>In November of &#39;05, I got my very first job as a layaway runner at Walmart. I almost consider this as the beginning of my modern life and certainly influential in the being I&#39;ve become; learning the way of the world and coming out of the introverted shell I had adopted through most of my teenage years.</p>
<h2 id="2007">2007</h2>
<p>October of 2007 saw me leaving the comforts of the Midwest for the first time and beginning my college life in the far reaches of Orlando Florida. A lot of my rougher edges in terms of design and development were sanded down while there for sure, though I&#39;ve since made strides to drop the moniker of designer. Certainly I grew socially while there, but still didn&#39;t live the typical college student life. Also, it was during this time that I developed my interest in anime, for good or ill.</p>
<h2 id="2009">2009</h2>
<p>Having graduated from college, I began my life in the professional world (late &#39;09, but &#39;09 it was). These times were absolutely influential to myself as a front end web developer, owing quite a lot to my fellow coworkers (the Frenchie in particular). It was certainly a trial by fire as I learned how the corporate world operates and how to most effectively make one&#39;s way within it, though I&#39;m certainly still learning on that part.</p>
<h2 id="2011">2011</h2>
<p>This year was big for two reasons: I finally learned my true worth as a developer and I finally began life outside of the domain of my parents&#39; household. Certainly, the latter is a major milestone for any individual, but I guess little else happened that year outside of beginning to realize how I could push the boundaries of being one&#39;s own keeper... like late night Taco Bell runs :)</p>
<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>
<p>This all leads into this year where I find myself permanently moved to a foreign part of the nation and working at a major company in the internet sector. It feels normal and yet surreal at the same time. Through all the previous years, I always had this nagging feeling that I was waiting for something, the kind of feeling of anticipation that you have around Christmas but less so. I could never put my finger on what it was I was waiting for, but that feeling has nearly vanished since I&#39;ve been here. Where I had cognitively resigned to working at a news station for the rest of my life, my gut had other plans and is now satisfied with the position I find myself in. Of course, there&#39;s still</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>Given the above as a foundation, considering major life events happen every two years, let&#39;s consider extrapolating this out into how I&#39;d like things to pan out.</p>
<p><strong>2015</strong>
Despite never having worked at any establishment for two years straight, I&#39;ll still be at LinkedIn and now an &quot;old-timer&quot;. More importantly than that, I&#39;ll be &quot;going steady&quot; with a very nice girl. Now, I would prefer that this actually happen before the two year marker much like the later items on this list.</p>
<p><strong>2017</strong>
By this time, with any luck I will be married or engaged to the aforementioned &quot;nice girl&quot;. Now, four years is a fairly small time span to find &quot;the one&quot; or a person coming close to, but I&#39;ve witnessed this happen first hand and it&#39;s certainly not out of the realm of possibility. Of course, if I continue to sit on my hands waiting for Mrs. Hackmann to waltz into my life, it becomes slightly more muddled...</p>
<p><strong>2019</strong>
In a word, fatherhood. The last two or three years I&#39;ve been feeling the pangs of wanting to have kids. A daughter to dote on and/or a son with whom I can show the wonders of nerddom (actually, all of that can apply to both). Either way, children with whom I can share the wonder and magic of the world that we live in.</p>
<p>The next six years should be interesting for sure and, if the past has shown me anything, will bring with it absolutely nothing that I imagined it would.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>IT&#x27;S OVER!</h2><time>June 30, 2013</time><div><p>I missed a few days of my month of blogging every day. So sue me. It&#39;s not like I went to a foreign country or anything. But, to close this all out, here is a picture of the now famous &quot;cat box&quot;. Some day we shall meet again, Japan.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HFBqYPm.jpg" alt="" title="I was not lying"></p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Ancient Art of Blood Letting</h2><time>June 28, 2013</time><div><p>There are many ways one can attempt to sober up. Drink water, eat food, drink coffee, smack to the face, and so forth. I figured this evening, after a little bit of happy hour at work, I would work off the rest of my buzz by taking a quick bike around the trail behind the campus. So, I lifted a <a href="http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzFhL2dvb2dsZWJpa2VpLmQyVi5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/a0b00e6b/4f9/google-bike-isn-t-what-you-d-expect-75fe25b1e0.jpg">Google bike</a> and did just that. As I felt my buzz decreasing, I decided it was about time to turn around and take myself home. So, when I saw a fork coming up in the road, I figured I would gracefully arc back around.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BKR52bg.jpg" alt="" title="Just a simple round about"></p>
<p>What you don&#39;t see is that there is a bit of a grade at this fork and road bikes don&#39;t have great traction. So, I wound up bleeding out the alcohol instead. (Don&#39;t click the break if you&#39;re not cool with the site of blood &#39;n shit.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2JVoX0k.jpg" alt="" title="Meaty"></p>
<p>This arm arguably got banged up the worst, but all of my limbs wound up with some level of scraped up. I haven&#39;t seen this much blood since my much younger years.</p>
<p>Due to probably the adrenaline rush, I was now completely sober. I biked myself back to work, did a quick patch job at the first aid station in the cafeteria, then made a trip to the store to pick up all of the first aid supplies I needed to finish the job (hint, I didn&#39;t even have so much as a band-aid at home). Luckily, those aforementioned younger years has given me quite a... CRASH COURSE in patching up wounds.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I Am My Own NSA When It Comes To Music</h2><time>June 27, 2013</time><div><p><p>It&#39;s time yet again to put on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3a52kemJcY" target="_blank">Data Analysis Cosby</a> hat and churn out some fun graphs based upon the listening habits of those using my ever present <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/DxCMS" target="_blank">music page</a> (a misnomer since it&#39;s done video for a long time now). Unlike <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-battle-for-musical-listening-supremacy/">last time</a> where I just compared myself to my brother Chris (the other heavy user of the product), today are just some general stats of when music is played and how much we&#39;re listening to. Steve (yet another brother) has become quite active with this, and as such is pretty high on the charts as well.</p>

A handful of subjects and some words on how I failed to meet them. Works well today when I&#39;m buzzing a bit and just need to get a post out.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I actually did very well last week, biking to work four out of five days and keeping away from the sweets. I stumbled a bit on Friday where I had a heart stopping burger and didn&#39;t bike, but it could have been worse. The weekend was fairly low key calorie wise as well. Compare that to today where I had four beers while conversing with a certain USB input virtual accessor and killing digital robots and then following it up with Taco Bell. Not great to be sure. Also, it&#39;s been rainy, so I haven&#39;t biked. Tomorrow I plan on changing that.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I&#39;m still running through the list of stuff I need to get for living in my new quarters. This weekend, I acquired myself a new bed, one of much higher quality than I&#39;m used to having; certainly one that cost more money than I would&#39;ve otherwise been comfortable in parting with. Additionally, a small trip to Japantown drained a few dollars, but not too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Ain&#39;t done squat, and this is unacceptable. Though, I do often listen to some of the audio lessons when they pop up on random during bike rides... this isn&#39;t actually helping me, though. It does sometimes re-enforce the little Japanese I do know, I guess.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Forever Unfinished</h2><time>June 24, 2013</time><div><p>I was going to do an accountability report today, but I don&#39;t want to type that much. Instead, I&#39;ll give you some pictures of in progress comics... that have been that way for probably a year now. A couple of these I&#39;ll probably finish eventually, and one I don&#39;t even remember the premise for, so it&#39;ll forever remain a mystery.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s not the last, though.....</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I Intend to Live Forever</h2><time>June 22, 2013</time><div><p>I missed a day of blogging (again), so sue me. But, allow me to get philosophical for just a moment.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of interesting notions in quantum physics, most interesting of which (and relevant to my muse) are that of quantum suicide and the multiverse theory. Quantum suicide is a thought experiment wherein a person is placed in a room with a death machine that has a 50/50 chance of killing the person every ten seconds. Tack on the multiverse theory, and both outcomes happen, birthing a new universe with each outcome. In the end, the person both dies lots of times and also never dies. Obviously, to the subject, they always experience the outcome where they live because death isn&#39;t something you can really experience.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s assume all of the above is true. That means only one thing.</p>
<p>Each and every one of us would be immortal... to our own point of view.</p>
<p>From an observation stand point, the mortality rate of the human race is 100%. The odds of living after a certain age become enormously small, but perhaps never actually zero. As long as there were even the most tiny chance that a person&#39;s heart would continue beating another second, they would continue down the string of universes in which they can continue to observe. In a way, their universe really does revolve around them.</p>
<p>Now, why haven&#39;t we seen a person 5000 years old? Because to the rest of us watching, the odds generally win. Every once and again a person will continue chugging long after the average age and push in into their &quot;later&quot; hundreds, but the odds that they&#39;ll die &quot;any day now&quot; keep going up until the rest of us observe them dying.</p>
<p>Is this something I believe? No, not really. But it&#39;s kind of fun to think about. Only time will tell if it&#39;s correct.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ll be the only one that will know the answer in my observable universe.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>A Gay Romp Across the Rainbow Bridge</h2><time>June 19, 2013</time><div><p>No, you pervert, not <em>that</em> kind of gay! Seriously, you are all queer folk (yes, you pervert, <em>that</em> kind of queer).</p>
<p>So, you read and/or saw about the trip to Odaiba and the enormous Gundam statue. Well, the part that I mentioned but didn&#39;t detail was the walk across the Rainbow Bridge, a suspension bridge that runs across some water and into Odaiba. We walked that bitch, all 0.5 miles of it, not including the walk to from the station nor the walk into Odaiba. I put in nearly 30000 steps that day, or somewhere on the order of 10 miles of walking. Granted, some of that was from the Imperial Palace earlier in the day (we&#39;re traveling back in time on these posts, I guess).</p>
<p>But, enough of the chit chat, here be pictures.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>The Weekly Accountability Report - Back to the Grind</h2><time>June 17, 2013</time><div><p>It&#39;s been a little while since I last did this, but since life is only going to even out from here, it&#39;s time to return to the Goals of the Year(R).</p>
<p><strong>Helth</strong> - Haven&#39;t been doing super awesome here. The allure of free M&amp;Ms is great indeed, and I&#39;ve now discovered the stash of breakfast burritos that work has in their infinite refrigerators. On top of that, laziness has lead to walks to Taco Bell and 7-Eleven (which doesn&#39;t make much sense). But, the &quot;no sugar, fruit&quot; rule is now enacted and a ban on fast food as well. Exercise wise, I&#39;ve just purchased myself a new and awesome bike that doesn&#39;t destroy my body as I try to ride, so there will be no more driving to work (weather permitting). These are now the two major areas of concern.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I&#39;m still in a pattern of getting things that I need to fill out my apartment, though the major purchases are tapering off (my big ass trip to Japan notwithstanding). Currently, the only items remaining on the list are new shoes (mine are quite literally falling apart), a table, and a bed. The bed will probably happen first as the couch is getting less and less comfortable by the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - If the Japan trip told me anything, it&#39;s that my skills in the language are nowhere near enough to actually get by day-to-day. I need to get back on this pronto. Perhaps not this year, but taking the ACT and enrolling for actual classes would probably be wise.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - FUCKIN&#39; DONE, SON. Scratch that off the list!</p>

Had to subscribe to Creative Cloud for After Effects to make it happen, but now I have more of a compulsory reason to do video stuff since I&#39;m stuck to it for a year. Still, $20/mo for professional video software isn&#39;t terrible.</p>
<p>But enough rambling, here&#39;s the video. I apologize for the ending. It&#39;s just a thing.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>The Haul - Part 2: Super Famicom and Friends</h2><time>June 15, 2013</time><div><p>There was really only one thing on my &quot;must buy&quot; list going into Japan, and that was the Japanese Super Nintendo, or Super Famicom. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been said on this blog, but I love the shit out of Ninty&#39;s 16-bit era. So much goodness packed into such small computing power. None of this generic brown and grey shooter bullshit, just unadulterated awesomeness.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hWzRzuD.jpg" alt="" title="Mmmmm yeeeessss..."></p>
<p>Three out of the four are rebuys, but the amount of money spent was small comparing to their American counterparts. The most I paid for any of these was $21 and that was Yoshi&#39;s Island. FFVI, which generally runs for $25-$80 used in the States, I got for a cool $12, box and all. Good times fo sho.</p>
<p>If my After Effects stops crashing, I pulled together a shitty video showing the differences between the American and Japanese release of the same-games I have, so that&#39;ll probably be up tomorrow. It&#39;s interesting stuff, really.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>An Interview In Akiba</h2><time>June 14, 2013</time><div><p>So - yes, I am opening up my blog post with &quot;so&quot; - we were bumming around Akiba (day 2) and meandering through yet another 7 story nerd shop. We happened to be on one of the manga floors when some older Japanese dude walks up to us. Now, at this point I&#39;m kind of freaking out because I&#39;m expecting huge language barrier and having to blow him off as rudelessly as I can. But, he starts speaking in what is more than passable English, asking us how we&#39;re enjoying things and, the odd bit, if we wouldn&#39;t mind being filmed for a promotional video for his company.</p>
<p>Well, fuck. This just doesn&#39;t happen every day, less so when you&#39;re in a foreign country.</p>
<p>We agreed to act out a little bit of being in the shop, being interested in things, and bullshitting the worst dialog ever. I assumed that our &quot;dialog&quot; scene was going to be B-roll (without asking, stupidly) and just said random shit. After that, he asked Chris and I a couple questions then handed us his card with instructions to email him with our contact info so he could give us some stills of the shoot. Below are the shots he provided. The funny thing I just realized that all the file names were titled with アメリカ人若者, or &quot;American youth&quot; (as google translates it, all I was able to read was &quot;American&quot;).</p>

It was a little over a mile walk to, but was interesting enough that we would cap every day off with it. It helped that there was a Taito Game Station in the area as well as a restaurant that we frequented a couple times.</p>
<p>The actual shrine itself is more newly built, being made of modern materials; that&#39;s probably because we fire bombed the shit out of Tokyo way back when. It&#39;s mildly disappointing, but still unusual in form by Western standards. Also, this place was chock full of tourists, both other Japanese natives and foreigners. This place was <em>always</em> packed. Of course, there&#39;s a shopping arcade setup along the strip to catch the likes of these people, though it was surprisingly short on non-sweets food stalls, a fact that I always lamented.</p>
<p>But, enough of my banter, you want pictures and pictures I shall provide.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Movie Review - Oz the Great and Powerful</h2><time>June 10, 2013</time><div><p>As I plan on being drunk tonight ushering a coworker off to other pastures, I will pen something not about Japan because I don&#39;t have access to my photo stores. So, instead, I&#39;ll review a movie I watched on the flight back, namely Oz the Great and Powerful.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nn0zBfW.jpg" alt="" title="Oz the Great and Powerful"></p>
<p>Set as a prequel to the original Oz story line, this movie sets about trying to fill in how the titular &quot;Wizard&quot; came to his position. And, for that, it&#39;s mostly satisfying. They do an alright job of brings all the ends together into a mostly believable state to go into the original 1939 movie.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a pity that pretty much everything else about the movies sucks.</p>
<p>First of all is the gratuitous use of shitty ass CGI. I was watching this movie embedded into the back of an airplane seat on a shitty LCD and it still looked shitty. The biggest offense was during wide shots that involved characters running over some sort of terrain, weaving in and out of being actual humans and digital doubles. The movement of the latter was so unbelievably bad that I had to make sure that I was still in the year 2013 and not ten years prior. Basically anytime there was a human interacting with something digital, it was bad; actors obviously interacting with nothing, sketchy physics, and bad matte paintings. For a movie made on the budget that this had and as late in the CGI game as we are, this is all very disheartening.</p>
<p>Next up on the bitch list was the stupid tie ins to the original movie. The opening of the film is all black and white and then converts to color (and WIDESCREEN) once Oz comes into the picture. Perhaps Kansas is really black and white. I&#39;ll have to go there again sometime. The cowardly lion (kind of) makes an appearance? The poppy field is used as a major plot device at approximately the same point in the movie and, finally, the wizard doles out the goods, as it were, to all the wayward adventurers, imparting upon them his words of wisdom... words which he should not be imparting because he&#39;s a self-absorbed, playboy asshole.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, are the characters and the actors&#39; portrayal of them. As previously stated, Oz (James Franco) is a conman and an asshole and never really does anything to redeem himself of these labels. If anything, by the end, these are reinforced and encouraged. Franco&#39;s portrayal is fine for the character, and I had no issues with it.</p>
<p>No, the really fucked up character was the one portrayed by Mila Kunis, the would be Wicked Witch of the West. Or, as she&#39;s portrayed in this film, the Naughty Stripper Witch of the West. The character is all over the place in terms of personality. At first she seems pretty reasonable and then suddenly goes angsty teenager on super &#39;roids. There was no real, solid reason for this change. It just happened. Suddenly, Kunis is screaming everything in the most annoying way imaginable making her an absolutely despicable character, but not in a good way. She deserves at least one Razzie for this performance, also the guys who wrote the dialog.</p>
<p>Even still, despite it&#39;s glaring flaws, it managed to entertain me for a couple hours on my long flight back, and for that I&#39;ll give it...</p>
<p><strong>2/5 stars</strong></p>

But, crashing on my couch onto a pile of pillows in a room that&#39;s not tiny is a good feeling.</p>
<p>But, that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>No, today begins a series of posts on all the shit I bought while overseas. Oddly enough, I actually came in fairly under budget on the trip while getting everything I&#39;d wanted plus more; it was a success to be sure.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s show-and-tell is of the figures that were purchased. Figures were near the top of my list of things that I had planned on spending money on. Luckily, I found most of them at pretty decent prices (three of the larger ones I got for $3/per). I&#39;m quite pleased with the haul, though there were a couple of characters that I just couldn&#39;t find any figures of. Either way, my quest for a 3D girlfriend has now become more difficult.</p>

<p>Yes, those are <em>ahem</em> protrusions in an aptly placed spot. They&#39;re made of the same material you&#39;d find in a keyboard/mouse wrist rest (yes, I touched it). My brother was quite taken by the material (he claims just the material).</p>
<p>Writing up enormously long posts is quite cumbersome on this laptop and are also so schizophrenic that it detracts from the awesomeness of individual locations visited.

We&#39;re heading out early for more sightseeing, I&#39;ve slept in late (6:45 am), so all you get today is a video of Chris and I bashing out some Taiko goodness at the SEGA arcade in Akihabara (who gracefully didn&#39;t have any photography bans that I could see). Ja ne~!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>When in Japan, Act Like a Tourist</h2><time>June 4, 2013</time><div><p>Today I pen this post in Sublime from the start, so even if I close the window, my post will be saved.</p>
<p>Our &quot;plan&quot; for this trip has been somewhat haphazard; nothing concrete but some bullet points. The rest is left to fate. I think yesterday&#39;s excursions proved just how well this methodology can work. We&#39;ve hit upon a little pattern to our madness: Akihabara every other day and touristy, sight seeing in between. Yesterday fell very much in the latter bucket.[break]</p>
<p>The first stop of the day was to the Burger King next to the train station. Breakfast seems to be American-<em>ish</em>. Chris had himself a Spam breakfast sandwich, Jeff an.... I don&#39;t remember, and I had a sausage cheese hamburger. It had a lot of mayonaisse on it, but was otherwise pretty delicious, if not entirely too small.</p>
<p>Upon completion of breakfast, we set out on foot to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skytree">Tokyo Skytree</a>, the second largest structure in the world. The walk itself was pretty decent, and it was a little scenic too.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WWQZy16h.jpg" alt="" title="Oodles of people"></p>
<p>The line to get up to the top seemed impossibly long, but in reality was dealt with in impressive time. After another wait in live, we were stuffed (almost literally) into an elevator that would take us ~1150ft in the air in what would be the smoothest elevator ride ever. If it hadn&#39;t been for the growing pressure in my ears, I wouldn&#39;t have known we were moving at all. The ride took all of fifteen to twenty seconds and when the doors opened, this is the sight we were greeted with:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YXcGu3eh.jpg" alt="" title="And yet more people"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZWOstD9h.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of school kids there. Not sure if they were playing hooky or what"></p>
<p>And then we walked to the edge and saw this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KVffHaPh.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s like a live version of Google maps"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vdZ7PNYh.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s like a real life version of SimCity"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VIqJrWSh.jpg" alt="" title="Not sure what the water jets are all about"></p>
<p>After much gazing out upon the tiny world, we took yet another elevator up another some ~300ft to the top of the tower.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BgwhHTih.jpg" alt="" title="A look down at where we had been"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7Dyep65h.jpg" alt="" title="The world does get smaller"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GVgLsaYh.jpg" alt="" title="Gazing on our own shadow"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IuA0I83h.jpg" alt="" title="If it weren&#39;t for the glass, I would have been dead"></p>
<p>The tower down and checked off the list, we headed out to Ueno, not entirely intentionally. We were actually planning on going somewhere else (which has now been postponed) and knew that there was a connect in Ueno. But, I&#39;d also heard of a thing called &quot;Ueno Park&quot; in a podcast I listen to, so we stepped off here.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wnpI8ykh.jpg" alt="" title="I&#39;m running out of thoughts for these subtitles"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UpwDCuuh.jpg" alt="" title="Are you guys even reading them?"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TwvWDXlh.jpg" alt="" title="If you are, say &#39;I love adult movies&#39; in the comments"></p>
<p>The first order of business was to begin arguing about what to do for lunch. Having seen a karaoke place, I suggested we go there because they probably served food. After many emphatic &quot;no&quot;s and and attempt to argue that it was cultural, we began arguing about American food and whatnot. We then stumbled upon a restaurant that looked promising... only it was very full. So, in an attempt to wait out the crowd, we hit up a store that seemed to give the promise of electrical goods.</p>
<p>Indeed, the first floor of the building had phones, tablets, and aisles upon aisles of iPhone cases. Where the real fun came in were the two floors above, namely the toy and vidya games stores (respectively).</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pxkK5NJh.jpg" alt="" title="So much Mario themed stuff"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cSUdqabh.jpg" alt="" title="And more standard board games, but with a twist"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zv7NwwFh.jpg" alt="" title="More of the same"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jHVLeeah.jpg" alt="" title="So many capsule toys"></p>
<p>We spent somewhere on the order of an hour in this building, entirely unplanned and done in desparation. So we decided to head back to the restaurant... which was even worse than it had been before. The hunger had reduced our appetite for arguing, so we came up with a plan: if we hadn&#39;t seen a decent &quot;authentic&quot; place by the time we had gone up to the next major intersection and crossed over, we would hit up a KFC we&#39;d seen. In our journey to that intersection, we glanced down a busy side street. In hopes of increasing the chances of not having KFC, we ventured down... and stumbled across a small underground shop.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FwfPsZzh.jpg" alt="" title="All alleyways..."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2XbA7FSh.jpg" alt="" title="...lead to shady looking places..."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lQTsltUh.jpg" alt="" title="...which lead to good food."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xjOuKpMh.jpg" alt="" title="And porkbuns"></p>
<p>The food was pretty fucking fantastic and there was a SHIT TON of it. Having satisfied the hunger and now in a much better mood, we headed to Ueno Park. There&#39;s not much to tell, so I&#39;ll just leave the pictures.</p>

<p>On the last edge of our walk through the park (and slightly suggested by the final picture), we took ourselves on a ride on pedal powered swan boats (ours was pink). It was really too cramped to down much in the line of pictures or video (though I thought I had got some video), so I&#39;ll have describe it IN WORDS. Chris and I were on the pedals and Jeff was steering. Immediately upon leaving the dock, we all started giggling our asses off. In fact, a descent into pure childhood antics was the theme of that boat ride. It was filled with lots of singling and loud &quot;whoooo&quot;ing. We even played trash patrol at one point, circling around to catch a Pepsi bottle that was drifting about. We also were waving at some of the fine Japanese female specimins (except for the ones that were with guys). It was probably the most good, hearty fun I&#39;ve had in some time. Also, good exercise; pedaling a boat is not an easy task, even we doing it in tandem. What I needed was some Dragon Ball drink to boost my power level.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6TdusYSh.jpg" alt="" title="IT&#39;S OVER 900000000"></p>
<p>The rest of the day was mostly uneventful. We took a train home (conveniently, the station was literally right under the park) and chilled for a bit. We then hit up the Asakusa shrine, as has become custom, and hit up Taiko machine. I miraculously didn&#39;t even touch a single crane machine. A quick stop at 7-Eleven and the alcohol vending machine downstairs, and we enjoyed an evening of being drunk and loud conversation.</p>
<p>Which brings us to sleep and also today.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Akihabara Day 1, Or How I Learned I Have a Gambling Problem</h2><time>June 3, 2013</time><div><p>One of the primary trips for our coming to Japan was to visit Akihabara, the mecca of all things <em>otaku</em> in this planet earth. If there is a &quot;genre&quot; of thing that could fit under the nerd label, Akiba will have a lot of something for you. Today (by date in the western hemisphere), we made our first pilgrimige to this magical land.</p>
<p>The day started at 5:45am, the sun blazing forth in bright fury. This is not natural nor is my waking up at this time. But, that&#39;s how it happened and we went with it. The first order of business was to silence the growl in our stomachs, and a trip to Denny&#39;s made quick work of that. Chris, being the more adventerous type, ordered a more Japanese course of fish, rice, miso soup, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D">natto</a>. My meal was mostly the same, only swapping the fish for bacon and a fried egg (I&#39;m not a big fish fan, you see). Jeff was the least adventerous, getting himself some French toast.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/S0sGWeE.jpg" alt="" title="FISH!"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bXJHVMn.jpg" alt="" title="BACON!">[break]</p>
<p>After a quick trip to suckle at the nipple of money and some confusion as to what train we were supposed to board, we were standing on the platform that would whisk us away. As the train arrived, I looked in horror to see that not only was it full, it was PACKED. I mean, like if the train were to have a head on collision with a boulder, anybody in the middle of the sea of people probably wouldn&#39;t even notice. So, when the doors opened, we just... crammed in. Personal space was a luxury not available anymore. Luckily, the ride was short and most everybody got off on the stop before ours, leaving plenty of breathing room. Our own stop was the last on the line, so we exited with the other folk in the most orderly fashion ever. Four lines of people made their way up the 97 escalators to ground level; when an escalator was encountered (and they came in pairs), the left side would stand as it ascended, and the right would walk. This order maintained itself all the way up and was a sight to behold.</p>
<p>We were dumped out onto the streets of Akihabara without much idea of what direction we should go. The GPS on my phone has been less than helpful, having much difficulty getting an exact fix on our position at any given time. This has made for some frustrating times trying to get bearings (I actually just declared &quot;fuck it&quot; and whipped out the compass a few times). But, as we wandered, I did catch a few pictures:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xUlumydh.jpg" alt="" title="Not pictured to the right - a giant ass jumbotron beaming out adverts"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4WGO9Yih.jpg" alt="" title="Still haven&#39;t checked out that FamilyMart"></p>
<p>We eventually realized that we were in town way earlier than retail hours. So, we made our way back to a Starbucks we&#39;d seen exiting the station to kill some time and get some better directions. After some difficulies ordering my tea (language barrier is a bitch and I couldn&#39;t remember &quot;wakarimasen&quot;, resorting to blank and confused looks and much nervousness), we settled down and I set to finding some wifis I could mooch off of.</p>
<p>Fresh maps in hand, we went scoping out the one store we had actually planned on visiting (Super Potato), mainly just to kill time. The GPS was still being wonky, and we weren&#39;t entirely sure we were on the right track, but then this peeked around a corner:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nJYzLGMh.jpg" alt="" title="I don&#39;t like you as a show, Yuyushiki, but today you became a beacon of glory"></p>
<p>Hurriedly heading in that direction, we were soon swamped in a sea of all things Japan.</p>

<p>We were still too early for opening, so we wandered some more before stumbling upon <a href="http://shops.japan-guide.com/shops/100">animate</a>, a store that had decided to buck the 11am opening trend. And my god, what a store it was. 7 floors of every anime (or in the vein of) type thing imaginable.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rm75CZDh.jpg" alt="" title="Idolmaster manga..."></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TmgdvUZh.jpg" alt="" title="Just some Squid girl amidst suggestive sluts"></p>
<p>We spent a solid hour (or more) in that store which was excellent as it brought us up to the time where everybody else opened. Our next stop was the Taito arcade next door.</p>
<p>This place is a building of pure evil. They didn&#39;t allow photos, which is sad because it was full of posters with Japanese image macros and grande arcade machines, but I will do my best to describe it in words. The first and second floors were mostly nothing but crane machines (more on that momentarily), the third was nothing but music games (Guitarfreaks, Drum Mania, and other things in similar vein), the fourth and fifth floors were all arcade games (fighting games mostly, though there was a Mario 1 cabinet), and nobody seems to remember the sixth. Must not have been too interesting. The arcade machines themselves were very insteresting machines, consisting of a sit down cabint with a large screen and the usual array of controls. Some machines were networked together for multiplayer games. I wish America would move to arcades like this; comfortable to play at and, since the hardware is generic, you can swap out games onto the same machines with relative ease. There was also a Taiko machine which is more or less the greatest thing ever. I need one for my apartment.</p>
<p>Now, the crane machines. Imagine that it&#39;s like an American crane machine, but with only two prings instead of three or four. Now imagine that the prizes are figures, posters, and other higher priced nerd fare. Imagine still that you can only actually go after one of the things in the machine and it&#39;s position precariously over the drop hole and you have only two moves to attept to get it; one move to the left, one move to the back. Finally, imagine that the grip of the cran arm is that of a 386 year old man but it nudges the box JUST ENOUGH that you&#39;re left thinking &quot;hey, I can get that on the next try&quot;, and then $40+ of this shit you still have nothing to show for while your asshole brother got something in only $3 (after you had spent $5 on it). As it turns out, I have a gambling problem.</p>
<p>Entirely depressed and dejected, we made our way out of the devil arcade and over to a used game/DVD shop next door. Given that the usual going price for two episodes of anime goes from $90 and up, these prices were a steal generally around half the price. I myself didn&#39;t purchase anything here, but Jeff did acquire himself a Vocaloid game for PSP.</p>
<p>Having spent nearly three hours in as many stores (all within about a couple hundred feet of each other), the time to eat had come. We found on the corner a couple food shops, one selling hot dogs (of which myself and Jeff partook), and one selling takoyaki (breaded and fried octopus balls, not testicles) which Chris had and will serve as the basis of the first episode of Chris Will Eat It. It&#39;s good stuff I assure you, but must wait for a future post.</p>
<p>We then made our way in the general direction of the store we had scoped out earlier, but were interrupted by a fire sale of figures on the street in front of another building. It was here that I began to balloon my figure collection and all for under $10. We went inside the shop where the aisles were only slightly wide enough to go down traveling sideways. It was crammed full of more figured, DVDs, and some used games. We were heading upstairs, but as Jeff and I were climbing noticed an 18+ sticker on the last step. An employee rushed over and stopped me from entering as I needed to purchase my goods downstairs first, but it was than that I noticed Chris walking back over (he was the only one who had made it to the top) with a look on his face. I&#39;ll let you figure out exactly what kind of wares this store was selling.</p>
<p>Now fully laden down with swag, we mad eour way to the one store we&#39;d been looking forward to hitting for months: Super Potato. It&#39;s like a retro gamestore on acid, stereoids, and awesomeness. Split between three floors, the atmosphere of this place was unreal. The first floor was full of 8- and 16-bit era consoles and games and our ears were assaulted with the blips and beeps of various 8-bit sounds and music (plus some Mario Kart music). It was both calming and yet elating; they were playing the nostalgia card quite well. The second floor had later generations of consoles up through the Gamecube (they had so many of these that they were actually using them as bookends). The last floor was a smokey arcade and we didn&#39;t check it out much.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/No8dFZZh.jpg" alt="" title="It was at this point that I let Jeff take the camera as I was ladened with goods"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WhHjXQRh.jpg" alt="" title="Lots of Super Famicom games..."></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7i4Kz9Rh.jpg" alt="" title="and disks... keyrings, that is"></p>
<p>By the time we finished with Super Potato, it was after 3 and we decided it might be best to get back to the hotel before everybody started rushing home. And the plan was effective; the train ride was quiet and mostly empty. Having arrived back at the hotel, we took a bit of a break before deciding that we&#39;d head back to Asakusa shrine and the shopping arcade, this time early enough that we could actually hit it during business hours. Instead of forgetting my SD card this time, I just flat up forgot the camera entirely. However, here are some phone pics:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ODdeaZWh.jpg" alt="" title="This picture doesn&#39;t do the scale justice..."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IehTQC5h.jpg" alt="" title="...nor this..."></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LmBxo63h.jpg" alt="" title="...nor this"></p>
<p>At the shopping arcade, we came across a sit down style restaurant and had ourselves some real fuckin&#39; ramen. At the very least, more real than the instant stuff that I&#39;ve consumed. And it was absolutely delicious. The pork was some of the most flavorful and tender meat I have ever eaten in my entire life. Sadly, our hunger was so vast that we forgot to take any photos.</p>
<p>After eating, we made our way to the Taito station for some Taiko and so I could squander away the rest of my money on crane machines (a whole $3 at this point). There was also a rather interesting game next to the Taiko machine that I just had to video, it was so ridiculous. I apologize for the vertical problem; I guess my phone isn&#39;t smart enough to know when I&#39;m filming in the correct position.</p>

<p>So, that pretty much ended the day. And now that I&#39;ve typed this twice, I&#39;m done.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>From the Land of Human Respect and Rape Tentacles</h2><time>June 2, 2013</time><div><p>It&#39;s an odd dichotomy to be sure.</p>
<p>Somehow, I managed to not <em>die of boredom</em> from my overnight stay at San Francisco yesterday. Interestingly enough, I wasn&#39;t the only person with the genius idea to camp out. As I wandered through out the airport trying to make myself tired enough to be able to sleep anywhere, I saw a lot of people sleeping anywhere. Particularly, restaurant booths were very popular.</p>
<p>But, that all aside, we endured the 11 hour flight and are now in the land that provides me with my primary sources of entertainment, both in television and games. The flight itself was alright, with plenty of entertainment options and a fair amount of food, none of which was terrible.</p>
<p>Being in Japan feels both surreal and almost... normal. Obviously, despite cultural differences, Japan is just another first world country and, as such, has many of the same conventions as our Western world. Combined with the fact that we&#39;re just kind of nestled into their civilization instead of segregated out as part of a tour group or something, it almost just feels like we&#39;re integrating in, as it were.</p>
<p>Except we&#39;re very, very not Asian and everybody around us is. And I have no idea what to do in some situations, due to language barrier and intrinsic Japanese mannerisms. But, all should be good in Akihabara tomorrow, the otaku capital of the world. I expect to lose quite a lot of money...</p>
<p>Before I go on to pictures, I just want to tell a small story that amused me to no end. As we were checking into our hotel, the lady behind the counter was explaining various this: where the bathrooms and showers were, how to get in the back door if we came in after hours, but notably checking out. &quot;You must check out before 10am and to do that, just put your key in the cat box.&quot; as she pointed to a simple wooden box with a porcelain cat on it. I don&#39;t know why, but it tickled me. I think it was part her earnest delivery coupled with her accent and just... it was called the &quot;cat box&quot;. It was insanely cute.</p>
<p>But now, some pictures:</p>

<p>Our hotel room is really, really small. Basically, it&#39;s large enough for the two bunk beds and the TV in between. But, it&#39;s a bed and quite conveniently located to other stuff, so I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all for this update, stay tuned for more.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Curse of Punctuality</h2><time>May 31, 2013</time><div><p>I am currently sitting in the airport, sulking in a chair across from the very open and lively airline counter with which I would check in my stuff. Through this line I passed and was at the counter rejected because I was trying to check in too early. My flight doesn&#39;t leave for another nine hours, but I like to be early.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always liked to be early.</p>
<p>When I worked at Walmart, if I wasn&#39;t there fifteen minutes before my scheduled clock-in time, I felt late. For any class, appointment, or interview, if I wasn&#39;t fifteen to twenty minutes early, I felt late. Perhaps it&#39;s less that I feel like I was late when I arrived, but I always aimed to hit these early times.</p>
<p>Because you never know what could happen in between.</p>
<p>For example, say you&#39;re commuting to work from 40 miles away. There&#39;s a whole hell of a lot that can happen in between. Weather, car accidents, or perhaps a horny giraffe has died of high blood pressure and is now blocking several lanes of traffic. That extra time works as a great buffer for these kinds of occasions so you can still be, at the very least, on time. If there are no issues, then you&#39;re early and get credit for being punctual.</p>
<p>And certainly, the bullet point on one&#39;s reputation for punctuality is part of the issue at stake. It&#39;s an easy thing to attain on the ever looming &quot;annual review&quot;. A high mark there gives one yet more buffer room on something else - small lapses in product quality, perhaps...</p>
<p>But, outside of that (and more importantly as I realized on the train), it reduces doubt. I am here, planning a sleep over at the airport, because I don&#39;t want anything left to chance on this very big trip of mine. I get as much work done on my projects as soon as I can to make room for the things that got glossed over, the challenges that weren&#39;t foreseen, and any scope creep that may and will occur. I aim to do everything in my power so that if something goes wrong, I did everything I possibly could to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like insurance you get just for being a litte bit impatient, a little bit paranoid, and a little bit proactive.</p>
<p>Well, that killed, like... fifteen minutes...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Trip to Jolly Ole Japan</h2><time>May 29, 2013</time><div><p>The &quot;weekly&quot; accountability report was one of those things that was supposed to help keep me in check in conforming to my goals for the year. It&#39;s hardly been weekly and it&#39;s hardly been keeping me on track (ask me how many times I&#39;ve ordered Papa John&#39;s in the last month. I dare you). But, there was one item on the list that&#39;s about to get scratched off and that is the trip to <em>Nihon</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve probably mentioned before, but this trip is something that my brothers and I have wanted to do for some time, borne out of our budding interest in Japanese animated wares. Anime, in a fashion, was sort of a gateway drug into all manner of Japanese things from games to language to culture to music. It seems only logical that from this fascination we should go and visit the source.</p>
<p>If you were to ask &quot;what are you going to do there?&quot;, the answer would be slightly awkward. You see, while there is a list of things we&#39;d like to do, there&#39;s no set plan, no schedule, no itinerary. This is probably a terrible way to visit a foreign country, let alone one for people who&#39;ve never left the States and also have only the most rudimentary knowledge of the native tongue. But, the idea is more one of exploration than anything else. So here are the main points we plan to hit:</p>
<h2 id="akihabara">Akihabara</h2>
<p>The mecca for all things otaku, we&#39;ll probably spend a goodly amount of time here. This is probably where most of my money will be dropped on swag, arcades, and god knows what else. There are also plans of hitting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_cafe">maid cafe</a> while there, where my brother Chris and I can admire the local selection of females while being entirely awkward around them.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>Obviously, food is a huge fuckin&#39; deal over there, and a huge fuckin&#39; amount different than over here. Now, I myself am not a seafood fan, but on this occasion I&#39;m going to make some exceptions. I&#39;ll try fish, I&#39;ll have one of my brothers film it in case the result is funny. We&#39;re already preparing for a bit called &quot;Chris will eat it&quot; wherein Chris will eat things that are.... unusual. Here&#39;s the &quot;official&quot; list:</p>
<p>[list][item]Takoyaki[/item][item]Dancing squid[/item][item]Sea-horse on a stick[/item][item]Something with jellyfish[/item][item]Taiyaki[/item][item]Nikuman[/item][item]Sushi[/item][item]Tamago on a stick[/item][item]Honest to god ramen stall[/item][item]&quot;Family&quot; restaurant (or Denny&#39;s)[/item][item]Korean Barbecue[/item][item]KFC[/item][item]Kitkats[/item][item]Pepsi[/item][/list]</p>
<h2 id="cultural-touristy-things">Cultural/Touristy Things</h2>
<p>Of course, we need to hit some more mainstream items as well. On the list are:</p>
<p>[list][item]Fuckin&#39; Sky Tree[/item][item]Rainbow Bridge[/item][item]Tokyo Big Sight[/item][item]Ueno Park[/item][item]A shrine[/item][item]A castle[/item][item]7-Eleven[/item][item]Karaoke[/item][/list]</p>
<p>This is, more or less, the list we&#39;ve been cultivating for the last several months and it&#39;ll be interesting to see what we hit, what we don&#39;t, and what we see that wasn&#39;t expected. Also, I plan on firing up the month of solid blogging again come June 1 (which means a blog post every day we&#39;re over there), so stay tuned for some fun stuff to come!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Californian Genesis</h2><time>May 22, 2013</time><div><p>In lieu of the weekly accountability report, I shall begin documenting the events that came about to land me where I am today (for posterity and stuff). Following that, I will also document my thoughts and adventures on living in the famous Bay Area (lots of pictures &#39;n shit).</p>
<p>The ball that got this whole thing rolling was a simple email I received somewhere in mid-January. It was from a recruiter who thought that my skills might match a position they had open. Now, I&#39;ve gotten several of these every month for the last couple years, to which I generally politely decline and proceed with my life (except that one time where I accepted and went to Winnercomm). The difference here was that this email was from LinkedIn and the job was also at LinkedIn, something far more awesome and legit than a random offer Kazhim. I immediately consulted one of my coworkers whom I shall refer to as &quot;Kairu&quot;:</p>
<p>[quote]<strong>me:</strong> Just got a job &quot;feeler&quot; to work for Linkedin
<strong>Kairu:</strong> to work for linkedin?
<strong>me:</strong> for
<strong>Kairu:</strong> damn son
<strong>Kairu:</strong> damn
<strong>me:</strong> yeah...
<strong>Kairu:</strong> welp, see ya later
<strong>Kairu:</strong> where is it?
<strong>me:</strong> Mountain View
<strong>me:</strong> CA&#39;
<strong>Kairu:</strong> col?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> ah
<strong>Kairu:</strong> figured
<strong>me:</strong> sme as google, iirc
<strong>me:</strong> <em>same
<strong>Kairu:</strong> going for an interview?
<strong>me:</strong> I... I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t expecting this
<strong>Kairu:</strong> what did they say?
<strong>me:</strong> I suspect it&#39;s a mass mailing, but still
<strong>me:</strong> I forwarded it to you
<strong>Kairu:</strong> Gondor has called for aid
<strong>Kairu:</strong> Will you answer it?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> It is indeed a mass mailing, but i would still respond. you never know what is down that path, and personally, i think you should check it out
<em>--- time passes ---</em>
<strong>Kairu:</strong> why arent you on the phone right now
<strong>me:</strong> because I&#39;m working?
<strong>Kairu:</strong> well you aint working on getting a massive fucking promotion
<strong>me:</strong> ...
<em>*Kairu:</em></em> :D[/quote]</p>
<p>As can be seen, I wasn&#39;t exactly leaping for joy. My feelings at the time were more that a huge fucking train had just rammed itself through the quiet temple that was my life. I honestly considered just ignoring the email entirely or declining as was my norm. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that nothing would come of anything and (with some egging from Kairu), I responded with interest in the position.</p>
<p>With that response, the waves of interviews began. I had an initial phone interview with the recruiter just talking about the position and LinkedIn and to ensure I was interested. After that was a simple technical phone screen, where a room of devs questioned me on various basic web dev topics. I thought I had failed at that point because I had trouble understanding the devs, due in part to them being on speaker, thick accents, and me being in the lobby of a busy building on my cell phone. I kept asking them to repeat and felt that my answers somehow came up short.</p>
<p>But, that wasn&#39;t the end (obviously). A few days later, I had a phone session where I talked to a couple of devs and they watched me write code via an online collaborative text editor. I felt a whole lot more confident about this interview than the previous one because I was at home on the phone with ear buds (these make me more awesome at phoning in general, not sure why) and also had a code editor in front of me. I don&#39;t rely on autocomplete for coding, but I have an easier time visualizing things when I can type it. Two of these types of interviews I did (back to back) and I again waited for a response.</p>
<p>And their response was &quot;we&#39;re going to fly you out for more interviews&quot;. Obviously, this is a big step because the cost of booking a flight, hotel, and car is not cheap (to me, at least) and if they were going to do that, they were serious. All I could think of, though, was my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">interview with Digg back in 2009</a> and how horrible that went and how green I was compared to everybody else. With that in my mind, I kept waiting for the details of flight information, but it was not forthcoming. I worried that perhaps <em>I</em> was supposed to set everything up (as I had at Digg), but as it turned out an email slipped through the cracks. I called to make sure everything was still on (the day before I needed to fly out) and it was all taken care of over the phone. Because of the last minute-ness of booking, I even got an extra evening in Mountain View.</p>
<p>The flight itself was more or less uneventful. This time I had an evening before hand to prepare and, more importantly, shower. I had a car, so I wasn&#39;t going to have to ask strangers to direct me and make a trek in the hot sun in my interview clothes. I even dressed &quot;down&quot; a bit for the interview itself, wearing jeans, a button down, and a jacket. I&#39;d been around the block enough times at this point that I felt pretty confident in how &quot;loose&quot; I would be able to present myself, both in appearance and tone. I was feeling nervous, as I am any time I meet people for the first time, but I was mostly confident about the interview itself.</p>
<p>And sure enough, things went very, very well. I had four or five interviews where I was asked code certain things on the wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor whiteboards. It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d be fun, but I really enjoyed taking everything &quot;back to basics&quot; as it were. Everybody I interviewed with was very friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy working for the company, which is a good impression to leave on one who may be employed there. I lunched with some of my interviewers at the company cafeteria (they had pizza that day) and we shot the shit about all manner of things. Honestly, nearly all of my apprehension was gone within the first five minutes of the first interview and I must say that I even enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>My entire day of interviewing lasted about six hours total and, since I had the entire evening free, I had asked the last person I interviewed with (who is now my boss boss) what I might do to kill the remainder of my day. He suggested a bar called 21st Amendment in San Francisco. And go to that bar I did and it was delicious. (Never thought bleu cheese would work on a hamburger.) It was a great way to cap off the day.</p>
<p>Even being there only two days, it was kind of sad to return home as I had caught the glimmer of what my life might become. But, that&#39;s how that goes and I just had to await their final decision. Now, even though I felt all of my interviews had gone well, I was split 50/50 on whether the job would actually be offered to me. So, when the recruiter emailed and said she&#39;d like to talk, I became even more apprehensive.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, I was offered the job and even though I was pretty certain I was going to take it (especially after she had listed off compensation and the benefits package), I slept on it for a weekend. Maybe it was just to make peace with myself and the situation, maybe it was to give the outward impression that I was doing to responsible thing and carefully considering the journey upon which I was about to embark. I dunno.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it&#39;s all kind of crazy. I entered 2013 with the idea that nothing new or momentous was going to happen, maybe some more dating but really just living life on cruise control.</p>
<p>A single email changed all of that.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - A Return to Shaming</h2><time>May 14, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/alcatraz.jpg" alt="" title="The feeling is similar"></p>
<p>It&#39;s been quite some time. About a month and a half, apparently. Now that I&#39;m slowly easing into life in <em>Cali</em>, it&#39;s time for the Accountability Report to return. Posts about me living here, the process of getting here, and the LinkedIn story will come at some time.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - There are certainly some interesting developments here. On the food front, I&#39;m eating probably the largest variety of food I ever have thanks to the company provided lunches. My vegetable consumption is definitely through the roof. I&#39;m staying hydrated with water, green tea, and fruit juices thanks again to the good folks who employ me. The downside is, they also provide unlimited free sugary snacks such as peanut M&amp;Ms and yogurt pretzels. I am weak to these items and have caved on a few occasions. My plan for this going forward is to eat some fruit (also company provided) when I feel the craving for something sweet. At home, the story is a bit different. My kitchen is 100% up to speed, so it&#39;s been a lot of frozen pizzas, peanut butter sammiches, and fried potatoes... also, there&#39;s a Taco Bell three minute&#39;s walking distance from me... and a 7-11 one and half minutes walking distance with many tasty sugary goods. Not eating at these places is going to be an exercise in will power.</p>
<p>Will power is a nice segue into exercise. I made the 1700 mile journey from my home with my bike strapped to the back of my car with the intention of using it as transportation for my daily commute. And I have indeed done that for a select few days. However, I&#39;m finding it harder and harder to motivate myself to exert this much effort early in the morning. Having a bike tire go flat and the bad tire that caused it has not helped. Short story made shorter, I need to stop being lazy.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - This has been ever present on my mind since my last day at Griffin. Moving has been no cheap task and my money reserves have been draining quite quickly. Higher rent, the cost of shipping my stuff out west, and the gas burned to get here are the biggest offenders, but also the lackluster final paycheck threw off the balance. Luckily, my first LI check and relocation money should be arriving soon and I will at least not have to worry about whether all the bills will get paid. If you read the paragraphs above, you know I don&#39;t have any fears about keeping fed. But, when that money does come in, a lot of it will be sunk into furniture-ing up my apartment as most of it was left behind. Also, that trip to Japan is going to be a huge cash suck. I think given a month or two, my financial outlook will be looking much, much better though and I should be able to hit all the goals I set out for in the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - With stability comes free time for me to again pick up the reigns of foreign language study. My intent was to have a better working knowledge for the trip, but that hasn&#39;t panned out due to my own laziness and the craziness of the situation around me. I&#39;m sad to say that my brother, who took his first college course on the subject, is now far more fluent in the language than I. くそ！</p>
<p>So, the reports to come should be interesting as I think my life stage has aligned itself with my intended goals. All I need to do is get my fat, lazy ass in gear and act upon them.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>How Do You Feel?</h2><time>April 22, 2013</time><div><p>With the eve of my big move fast approaching, I have been saying my farewells and with it comes a phrase that is becoming quite tiresome.</p>
<p>How do you feel?</p>
<p>Unlike Spock in Star Trek IV, I understand the question fine. However, my answer is the same. I don&#39;t really have one.</p>
<p>Moving several states west is, indeed, a very large &quot;life event&quot; and I am fully aware of this. Working for the company running the fourteenth most visited website in the <em>world</em> is no small thing to sneeze at. This is essentially my dream coming true: living in Silicon Valley making a living programming. I&#39;ve only wanted this for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>And yet, I don&#39;t have any strong feelings about this. My general response thus far has been &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hit me yet&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m very excited that this opportunity has landed in my lap. As stated, it is my dream come true (at least, one of them). Being able to essentially start my life on a clean slate is certainly appealing and the potential for the future is quite bright.</p>
<p>To that end, I&#39;m also saddened that I have to leave such wonderful people behind. My family and all the friends that I&#39;ve made over the past few years are no longer going to be within quick driving distance. The &quot;clean slate&quot; I mentioned will apply here as well, moving into a state I don&#39;t know, full of people I don&#39;t know, and a culture that is going to baffle the crap out of this Oklahoma native.</p>
<p>But, I don&#39;t feel very strongly any of these emotions. It could very well be that the gravity of the adventure before me <em>hasn&#39;t</em> wormed its way from the conscious part of my brain to the emotion part. But, as I was driving back from my good-bye visit to my family, I had another thought.</p>
<p>I&#39;m ready.</p>
<p>Everything I&#39;ve done up to this point - starting from about the time I started working on YPN in earnest - has been to break into &quot;the industry&quot;. I had my shot back in 2009 when I <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">interviewed at Digg</a>, but looking back, I was nowhere near ready, neither as a developer nor as a person. Since then, I&#39;ve slowly acquired knowledge on both fronts, honing my craft, making friends and learning to better interface with people on a professional and personal level, and just learning how to live in general. It&#39;s been a slow but steady ascent to where I am now and every little experience has prepared me for what I&#39;m about to do.</p>
<p>LinkedIn and California... I&#39;m ready for you.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Internet and the Importance of Being Seen</h2><time>April 17, 2013</time><div><p>Many years ago, right before I graduated, some of my fellow graduates and myself were asked to impart any knowledge we&#39;d gleaned from the previous two years upon a class full of freshmen. I said something to the following effect:</p>
<p>[quote]The Internet. If you make something, put in on the Internet. I don&#39;t care where, I don&#39;t care how. Get yourself and your work out there. Spam it on Facebook, announce it on twitter. Make as much noise as you can because you never know who might be looking.[/quote]</p>
<p>My reasoning for such a bold statement is that twice during my tenure at Full Sail, I had been noticed by entirely random people for various personal projects I had done. One was from the head of the Madden series at EA when he ran across my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows/">Rock Band drums thing</a>, another from a company in Chicago who had run across my deviantArt profile (I actually made money off of that one). The point being, by making public everything I worked on, I was (almost) passively setting up a portfolio of work that could be stumbled across by anybody in the world at any time.</p>
<p>And if you think I stopped after I got my job, then you obviously don&#39;t know me or follow me on any of the various social media avenues. Even if I make something that isn&#39;t necessarily portfolio worthy, if I&#39;ve done something mildly interesting, it finds a home here, on my GitHub profile, or where ever might be a fitting spot. I even dig up and post past projects, because it can give a frame of reference from where I&#39;ve come and how my abilities have evolved.</p>
<p>Of course, just uploading things by itself only gets a person so far. You have to advertise it somewhere. These days, my most vocal platforms are Facebook and reddit, especially reddit, or /r/awwnime in particular. There&#39;s actually a method to that madness beyond making a life of posting cute anime artwork simpler; namely, engaging directly with an audience to gauge need and resolve issues.</p>
<p>My work on awwnime is not the first time I&#39;ve done this. There are quite a few projects of mine that started out as just something to entertain me or make my life simpler in some way, generally pretty niche projects. But, I would then find an audience for these things. A good instance would be <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/how-many-times-can-one-man-code-the-same-thing/">my Tetris Attack game</a> back in 2005. I wanted to ensure that I was being as accurate as I could and also squashing as many bugs as possible. The person writing the code is the worst one to do debugging, generally. So I tossed this out to the guys at the tetrisattack.net forums and got way more response than I could have imagined. This has happened time and again. Animal Crossing Pattern Designer, MP Skin Studio, all the various YPN engine incarnations, all projects that eventually got to the masses and various levels of &quot;acclaim&quot;. Without even really trying, I was building a public history that could prove that I at least know something about my craft while at the same time building my ability to work with people and resolve issues.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present where I&#39;m on the cusp of working for a major player in the Internet sector, and I know that all those years of tossing stupid projects to the masses, spamming the shit out of this blog on twitter and Facebook, keeping all my social profiles up to date, and just engaging with a larger audience be it relevant to anything at all has lead me to where I am today. You never know who is going to be looking at this stuff.</p>
<p>Make it public, make it awesome.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Remuse - The Breakfast Club</h2><time>April 6, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3JSJ2Y9.jpg" alt="" title="The Breakfast Club"></p>
<p>Instead of packing my shit for the move to &quot;Cali&quot;, I&#39;ve been doing not much and also watching TV and movies. I may have stated earlier, but the Breakfast Club is almost wholly responsible for the creation of <a href="http://whatshouldmattwatch.com">whatshouldmattwatch.com</a>, and I finally just bought a copy and watched it. I feel that I will not be able to adequately review this movie because there is simply so much going on. To that point, I don&#39;t think a single watching is sufficient to really pick up on everything this movie has to offer. So, what I will do is offer my brief synopsis (as useful or not as it may be) and then muse about my thoughts on each character (hence the title of this post). Critical review really is not my forte and I don&#39;t want to try and pretend that I can.</p>
<p>Early one Saturday morning, five students find themselves stuck in detention for the remainder of the day. Seemingly, each person is of a different high school character archetype: the athlete, the criminal, the basket case, the brain, and the princess. Throughout the course of the day, each person gives up (willingly or not) details about their lives and all is not necessarily as it seems with the fronts they put up.[break]</p>
<p>Before I go on a character break down escapade, I want to say that this is one hell of a movie. As stated above, there is simply so much happening that it&#39;s really hard to wrap your mind around all of it once. With the exception of a couple of random &quot;action&quot; scenes that, in my opinion weren&#39;t really necessary, this movie exists almost entirely as dialogue. It&#39;s a cerebral and psychological movie and certainly not as lighthearted as other Hughes films like Sixteen Candles or Ferris Bueller. Shit gets real in this movie.</p>
<p><strong>Allison (The Basket Case)</strong>
Allison, by nature of her shy and quiet demeanor, is probably the least complex character of the group. Or she might be the most complex. It&#39;s hard to tell because she admits to being a habitual liar, so we can&#39;t really know whether anything she&#39;s said in the movie (even the part about being a liar) is true or not. At one point she states that her parents ignore her, which would certainly give credence to developing such a trait in an attempt to get their attention. It would also lend to her eccentricities such as eating a Captain Crunch sandwich and her goth-ish appearance. I can&#39;t help but feel that every shy/quiet character ever created after 1985 is in some way modeled after her.</p>
<p><strong>Claire (The Princess)</strong>
Claire is supposed to be the super popular, rich bitch of the group, but she never really acts it. Probably because she&#39;s caught in the middle of a marital spat between her parents and really doesn&#39;t want to have anything to do with either. Once again, we have Molly Ringwold in a role that sees her lamenting her lack of <em>sexual action</em>, though it&#39;s again implied that this resolves itself at the end of the movie. I&#39;m about to go off on a tangent.</p>
<p>This whole virginity as a negative stigma thing is quite possibly the most fucking retarded preconception of the human race. What does it matter if you&#39;ve done the nasty? Does this somehow make you a better or more of a person than other people? When talking about adults, having had your V card punched is the <em>norm</em>. Is that it? Is it one of those &quot;everybody&#39;s doing it and you&#39;re not therefore you&#39;re weird&quot; things? I&#39;ll tell you that I consider myself pretty successful as a person in my personal, work, and social life without ever having <em>verbed the adjective noun</em>. I suppose people think that one&#39;s virginal state is a direct reflection upon their aptitude as a social being, but here&#39;s something mind blowing: it can be a <em>choice</em> just as much as it can be an <em>inability</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew (The Athlete)</strong>
Andrew lives on the whims and decisions of his father whom he hates. He does this in an attempt to prove that he&#39;s not worthless. Despite being &quot;the jock&quot; of group, you can tell early on that beneath the facade that he probably actually cares about the well being of the others in the group as he&#39;s always the first to lend assistance in their troubles. Of course, he could just be white knighting, but I it could be an attempt at atonement for the actions that landed him in detention.</p>
<p><strong>Brian (The Brain)</strong>
Brian&#39;s early bits in the movie are cringe worthy. He pipes up in other people&#39;s conversations with his own quips without measuring the atmosphere just to feel involved. I sadly identify with this all too well, especially in my youth. Also, his name isn&#39;t fair; it&#39;s an anagram of &quot;brain&quot;.</p>
<p>[b]John [Bender] (The Criminal)[/b]
God, I don&#39;t even know where to start with this one. John is by far the most complex and quite possibly the smartest and definitely the most biased of the group given his abusive upbringing. He&#39;s also the most entertaining with his lack of shits given attitude taken with everybody else. In a lot of respects, he reminded of Shawn Hunter from Boy Meets World.</p>
<p>So, there is my horribly inadequate attempt at organizing my thoughts into words on this movie. I will end by saying that I was not entirely happy with the ending. I&#39;m not a fan of open endings, not at all Sam-I-Am. Maybe in Hollywood&#39;s never ending quest for sequels, we&#39;ll get one for this.</p>
<p>No. Please don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why, but for the last several months I&#39;ve had this odd hankering to watch the old 1992 Disney animated classic, Aladdin. Sometimes while driving home from work in my car I&#39;ll burst out into a song from the flick. I even braved the children&#39;s section of the library once in an attempt to snag a copy. (This is a thing I will never do again unless I am accompanied by a child; it felt awkward). So, knowing that my folks had a copy and that I&#39;d be joining them for Easter, I put out the proposal that we watch after our ham riddled feasting. This would be my first time watching through the eyes of and adult and the first time I&#39;d seen it in at least fifteen years.</p>
<p>The plot isn&#39;t really something I should have to <em>synopsize</em>, but I&#39;ll do so anyway. Set ten thousand years in the future in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah, there is a magical lamp in which resides a genie who can grant (almost) any three wishes to the person who rubs said lamp. Antagonist Jafar is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it for he wants to rule the world. Aladdin is a poor, thieving, and horny teenager who, as it turns out, is the only guy who can retrieve the lamp from its resting place in the Cave of Wonders. Along the way, he runs into a runaway Princess Jasmine who is also horny and tired of her life. Long story short, Aladdin gets the lamp and hijinks ensue.</p>
<p>Thematically, the movie seems to be about being unsatisfied with life. All of our characters yearn for something more from life but are &quot;trapped&quot; in their situations. Aladdin&#39;s poor and I guess doesn&#39;t want to get a job. Jasmine is sick of having her father and the law dictate her life. Similarly, Jafar is also bound by the Sultan&#39;s rule and just wants to watch the world burn. And, finally, the Genie would rather not be at the beck and call of whomever rubs his tiny dwelling.</p>
<p>Let the musing begin.[break]</p>
<h2 id="making-an-effort">Making an Effort</h2>
<p>In writing a sentence in my second synopsis paragraph, I thought of something I hadn&#39;t before. Why <em>is</em> Aladdin a street rat? He&#39;s poor, yes, and has to resort to thievery just to survive. But we don&#39;t see him actually <em>making an effort</em> to improve his condition. Instead of handing out CVs to the local sugar dates or fish stalls, he just bitches and moans about how life is unfair. Fucking put some effort into it, boy. In real life, the solution isn&#39;t just handed to you as a magical lamp or a random encounter with royalty. You have to actively <em>do</em> something to change your life. Jafar, while certainly being evil, has obviously done quite a lot of work in his quest to rule the world. Not only is he an accomplished sorcerer, but obviously also a fairly learned man if he&#39;s able to pull all the pieces together in his search for the lamp. Jasmine also makes her escape from the palace in an attempt to change things. Her process may have been ill thought out and naive, but a step is a step. The only person who actually cannot do anything about his condition is the Genie and he is, for the most part, the happiest character in the entire flick.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Aladdin is deadbeat scumbag.</p>
<h2 id="speed-dating">Speed Dating</h2>
<p>The movie also suffers from the usual Fairy Tale Relationship Syndrome in that Aladdin and Jasmine hit it off with very, very little time of actually knowing each other. A chance encounter in the marketplace and a magic carpet ride is all it takes for these two to commit to a life together. Shit like that just doesn&#39;t happen in real life and, if it does, it&#39;s <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/9/">exceedingly rare</a> when it works out at all. Perhaps that&#39;s why I have a penchant for stupid romcom anime; it&#39;s slightly more real in that it takes a dozen episodes (on average covering six months to a year of story) before guy and girl get to the relationship stage. Granted, there&#39;s usually a lot of contrived shit in between, but time-wise, it&#39;s better. But, I digress.</p>
<h2 id="an-excellent-judge-of-character">An Excellent Judge of Character</h2>
<p>To be honest, Aladdin and Jasmine, while technically being the main characters, are ultimately the most forgettable. They&#39;re bland and cliche and, while there is certainly nothing wrong with the acting, they just don&#39;t stand out. The real stars of the show are Jafar, Iago, and of course, the Genie. Even the carpet has more personality, though that&#39;s not surprising since it takes more thought to get a feeling across using nothing but pantomime.</p>
<p><strong>Jafar/Iago</strong></p>
<p>As a kid, I never would have felt anything for Jafar. Disney movies are made so that everything is black and white; Aladdin&#39;s the good guy, Jafar the bad. Done deal. And while that still holds more or less true, there were moments where I felt sorry for Jafar. He&#39;s got a job working for chubby dullard and his air head daughter. Now that I&#39;ve been in the workforce for a few years, I can understand exactly how he feels. Granted, we don&#39;t ever get an insight into whether there&#39;s a <em>reason</em> he&#39;s evil instead of just apathetically sarcastic, but work for that kind of person long enough and one might just turn evil. Or...</p>
<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that Jafar isn&#39;t the evil one after all. Iago is painted to be the comic relief of their tag team duo, but he&#39;s obviously just as aware of what&#39;s going on if not more so. His sarcastic remark to Jafar&#39;s statement of Gazeem being &quot;less than worthy&quot; and Jafar&#39;s lack of reaction to the tone means that Iago is in a relationship of equals with Jafar (or close). It was Iago and not Jafar that came up with the plan to marry Jasmine, become the Sultan, and then off her and her father. I think the only thing keeping Iago from being a runaway evil success is that, in the end, he&#39;s just a parrot.</p>
<p><strong>The Genie</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s honestly not much to say about this. Robin Williams <em>is</em> the Genie, although he doesn&#39;t have quite as much screen time as I remember. It&#39;s also interesting to think that he&#39;s really the only A list actor in this movie and that it was a big deal at the time. The tables are exactly the opposite now; it&#39;s a big deal and almost heresy when a movie has an unknown in a leading role (Ratatouille is a good example). Getting back to the topic, the amount of pop culture references that Robin Williams&#39; characters pulled out is infinitely more hilarious when you&#39;ve lived a few more years. For the first time ever I got the burping the Tupperware reference.</p>
<p><strong>The Carpet</strong></p>
<p>This is less a blurb about the carpet and more about the technology used in the film. CGI was still in its infancy at this point and Aladdin was only the second animated Disney film to use rendered to film computer visuals (Beauty and the Beast being the first). It is painfully obvious, too. The Cave of Wonders is very CG looking, the lava in the lava chase is very CG looking (the recolored fractal texture just seems off). The tower rolling down the snow covered mountain at the end doesn&#39;t fare any better. And the reason why I put this under the carpet is because, while the carpet was hand drawn, the texture was applied digitally and it makes for some rather odd looking effects. One of the big things in cartoon style animation is the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_and_stretch">squash and stretch</a> to make animation look more... animated. Well, this leads to some very ugly results on the carpet texture because, while when the carpet is at rest things look fine, when it is morphed into an exaggerated shape, the texture becomes exaggerated in places that it might not in real life. Somehow Disney managed to find a spot in the Uncanny Valley for an animated rug. Granted, it still looked better than it did in the Aladdin TV series (where they just hand animated it). I could never figure out why it looked so shitty as a kid, but now I know.</p>
<h2 id="ugh-musicals">Ugh... Musicals</h2>
<p>It was typical for the time, but every goddamned animated film was riddled with musical numbers. Why? I don&#39;t know, but Aladdin is no different. Everybody winds up singing about their strifes or whatever at some point. Again, I don&#39;t know why; singing will not solve most of life&#39;s problems. Most of the songs are benign, but the main one, &quot;A Whole New World&quot; is so. Fucking. Catchy. And I don&#39;t mean catchy in the annoying kind of why. It&#39;s a damn good song. Remember that bit above about how I sing in the car? This is usually what I break out into. There&#39;s just something about it...</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ve said more than I need to about this film, so I&#39;m going to wrap it here. If I do another one of these, Beauty and the Beast will probably be next as it stands with Aladdin as probably one of the most watched films of my life (as a child).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Third Time&#x27;s a Charm</h2><time>March 28, 2013</time><div><p>I just entered the word &quot;weekly&quot; in the tags field for this post. Not only is this a lie, but it&#39;s also a farce. Granted, it could have been closer to truth if I had clicked the submit button on of the previous two times I sat down to pen this block of text. But, I don&#39;t like to dwell on the past. It&#39;s set in stone and cannot be changed. All I can do is look forward and make that as awesome as I can.</p>
<p>If somehow the only way you get your &quot;me&quot; information is via this blog, then you&#39;ve missed out on the big announcement of my hiring at LinkedIn and upcoming move to Mountain View California. This puts my life in an odd state of flux right now as I prepare to move myself and my things seventeen hundred miles west. Needless to say, the items on my list are going to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Not only have I had McDonald&#39;s once since the previous post, but Taco Bell twice. The first cannot be explained away, the second can. Cool Ranch Doritos tacos. Also, I&#39;ve been trying to spend as much time with the folks around me as I can. Generally, going out to eat is a good way to do that. Of course, when my lunch hour is eaten up (pun intended) by eating out, my usual noon wanderings don&#39;t happen. Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t do it later, I guess... But, I&#39;m honestly not worrying about exercise right now as I&#39;ll be getting plenty of that biking to and from work in CA.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Ha! Yeah, nothing about moving to California is going to be cheap. Moving my shit is going to be $1000+, the apartment is going to be $2300/mo, and this doesn&#39;t take into account any ancillery costs that will come with. Luckily, LinkedIn will be paying to relocate me, but I will have to shoulder all of costs initially. To say I&#39;m a bit nervous about whether I will be able to afford everything up front and continue to live between my last Griffin check and my first LI one is a bit of an understatement. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll all work out in the end, but that worry is there.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Ha.... yeah...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post some more about the whole LinkedIn thing at some point, but there may be a quiet spell until things get settled.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Tardiness is the in Thing</h2><time>March 12, 2013</time><div><p>So, I&#39;m late again. That&#39;s cool, I had my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - A little bit of good, a little bit of bad. The weather has been on and off favorable for walking and, when it was, I&#39;ve made the best of it. Today and Saturday both I did 7+ miles worth of walking and I&#39;ve finally brought my weight below the impentitrible 219 barrier (216 at the lowest). That&#39;s a trend I certainly want to continue. I must confess, though, that I did have McDonald&#39;s once a week-ish ago. I should also state that I plan on having Taco Bell this weekend when my brother comes for a brief visit from college. Gotta try that new Dorito taco, after all. But, other than that, I have no plans to get on the recurring fast food wagon.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - More money than should have been was spent, though none on Japanese things (amazing considering that <a href="http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/P4YrzRQ2Qub2OldV=E/browse/item/97476/4/0/0">Nisemono</a> has been calling my name). I purchased a new 2TB hard drive for my computer as I was certain my existing one was dying (considering the speed and stability increase I&#39;ve had since the swap, am still certain of). I&#39;ll call that necessary. Add to that the fee for my passport, a higher than usual restaurant visitation rate, this <a href="http://www.teefury.com/archive/2056/Legend_of_Jedi/">bitchin&#39; T-shirt</a>, and certain other expenses, I spent more than I would have liked. Though, I did dabble in some freelance work which offsets at least some of all that. Actually, a goodly amount.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Nothing. I&#39;ve done nothing. And I am ashamed. How will I ask all the Japanese girls for their phone numbers? Oh, wait. That&#39;s the one thing I <em>do</em> know how to say.　でんわばんごうですか？Honestly, though. I&#39;ve been keeping tabs on my brother&#39;s advancement in his real college course and I&#39;ve absorbed more than I&#39;d thought. I just really need to bolster my vocabulary.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Movie Review - American Graffiti</h2><time>February 26, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3ZAfLYl.jpg" alt="" title="American Graffiti"></p>
<p>Before Star Wars and after THX 1138, George Lucas made a little film called <em>American Graffiti</em>. Despite studios acting like assholes, as the often do, the film was a financial success, making fifteen times more than its budget on first theatrical run, and was welcomed to critical acclaim.</p>
<p><em>Graffiti</em> is a coming of age type story set in the early 60s, following four groups of mostly high school seniors, as they burn through one last night of <em>teenagery</em> before going their separate ways to begin the next chapters of their lives. Steve (Ron Howard) is planning to go off to college and tries to get his girlfriend to go along with the idea of an open relationship. Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) is having second thoughts about college, and has various hi-jinks and adventures as he tracks down a woman in a white Thunderbird who randomly mouthed &quot;I love you&quot; to him at a stop light. Street racer Milner (Paul Le Mat) is just out cruising in his &quot;piss yellow&quot; hot rod when he finds himself in the company of young a teen aged Carol (Mackenzie Phillips). Finally, &quot;The Toad&quot;, who is borrowing Steve&#39;s car, picks up a random girl and spends the evening cruising with her and getting into various troubles. Somewhere in there, Harrison Ford shows up and acts like a dick.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be blunt: I didn&#39;t enjoy this movie. For the longest time as I was watching, I kept asking myself &quot;where does the plot come in?&quot; Almost immediately, we&#39;re introduced to a shit ton of characters who then go their separate ways. Every few minutes, the plot narrative will bounce between one of the four groups making it hard to gain a mental foothold of what&#39;s going on for the first half hour or so. I probably wouldn&#39;t have had this issue had I realized going in that there is no central plot and this is, more or less, a slice of life piece. The stories of each group interweave every once and again and all come together at the end, but there&#39;s no singular plot thread holding the pieces together.</p>
<p>Our characters are the usual fare I would expect for a baby boomers era group of teenagers; namely, they&#39;re all a bunch of ass wagons with nice looking cars. Steve treats his girlfriend like shit, making demands of her after breaking the news that, while he&#39;s away, they should see other people to &quot;strengthen their relationship&quot;. Curt gets a raging boner from a passing stranger in a vehicle and this is the catalyst for his entire arc. Perhaps I&#39;m an oddball, but when random people yell things of this ilk at me from cars (or otherwise make similar statements to me), I generally raise an eyebrow, shrug, and continue on with life (this has happened before and on multiple occasions). &quot;Toad&quot; plays the stereotypical &quot;geek + car + girl&quot; role, nigh identical to &quot;Farmer Ted&quot; in <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/movie-review-sixteen-candles/">Sixteen Candles</a>. Interestingly, the most likable character in the movie is the motor head, Milner. Yes, he doesn&#39;t treat Carol the greatest, but he makes the decision not to be an ephebophile and sticks with that the entire movie.</p>
<p>The one facet of this movie I did find interesting was the soundtrack. From beginning to end, it plays as if we&#39;re listening to a radio station complete with DJ cut ins and advertisements. Both the content and the station itself play some affect the story and sometimes ties scenes from different groups together chronologically. I thought it was a pretty nifty touch and definitely helped set the tone and feel of the film. Not that it had any problem with that before.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m not a fan of <em>American Graffiti</em>, though I can see why others might like it. I actually felt while watching that it felt a lot like <em>Animal House</em>, which, incidentally, I didn&#39;t really enjoy either. Luckily, George Lucas made a couple of other films that are entertaining to watch.</p>

<p>Next up in my sickly watchings was the 1984 action comedy starring Eddie Murphy. It&#39;s only fitting that my first Eddie Murphy movie be his break out film.</p>
<p><em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> follows Detroit detective Axel Foley (Murphy) as he tracks down the gentlemen who murdered his best friend. Foley is not the type of guy who follows standard conventions or rules. He&#39;ll do whatever he feels is necessary to get the information he desires, including a lot of social engineering. His investigation takes him out to Beverly Hills, where he makes enemies (and friends) of the local police department, a no-nonsense, by the book operation. In particular, Foley is paired up with/against the bumbling duo of John Taggert (John Ashton) and Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold, aka <a href="http://i.imgur.com/g6xbjCK.jpg">Dr. Neil Miller</a>) as he tears through Beverly Hills in search of the those who murdered his friend.</p>
<p>What I found most odd about this movie is how low-key it is. The action pieces are few with the largest one being a shoot-out between maybe ten guys spread over the course as almost as many minutes. The set pieces are also few, with the story bouncing back and forth between a half dozen locations; from the precinct to an art gallery to a hotel, back to the precinct to a warehouse, back to the precinct to a mansion, back to the art gallery, then to precinct and the hotel again. It keeps the scale of things very small. Indeed, even the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4kWpi2HnPU">movie&#39;s theme</a>, which is played just a few too many times, is a cool yet almost mellow riff.</p>
<p>One would think in a movie labelled &quot;action comedy&quot; starring Eddie Murphy would have the comedian putting his talents to use. But, he&#39;s is definitely not where most of the comedy is. He&#39;ll spit off a one liner or two, but generally he just plays Foley as a too cool for school type personality. No, where most of the comedy comes is from our cop duo of Taggert and Rosewood. These two riff off each other exceptionally well and provide, in my opinion, about 90% of the entertainment the film has to offer.</p>
<p>In the end, I didn&#39;t hate Beverly Hills Cop; it was a mildly entertaining flick. But, it&#39;s too small in scope and played to low key to really work well as an action movie. They also try to put in the little bits of comedy here and there, but rarely did I laugh at loud of those attempts. How it managed to be the biggest movie of &#39;84 ahead of <em>Ghostbusters</em> - which, I think we will all agree, has at least more notoriety than <em>Cop</em> - I&#39;ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong> - 3/5</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Movie Review - Battle Royale</h2><time>February 20, 2013</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/battle_royale.jpg" alt="" title="Battle Royale"></p>
<p>Having been cooped up the past few days due to root canals, pain killers, and sickness, I had an opportunity to hit some items on my movie watch list. The first of which was Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Battle Royale is a fairly standard &quot;battle survival games&quot; type story. In some dystopian alter-verse, a bus load of middle schoolers is shipped off to an uninhabited island and tossed out into the unforgiving wild with the given goal of being the only survivor by the end of three days. It covers the general theme of how extreme situations can cause people to do things they never would have otherwise. You&#39;ve seen this story plenty of times over in things such as Lord of the Flies, Hunger Games, and probably a couple dozen sitcom plots. Only, this time it&#39;s in Japan and if more than one person comes out alive, everybody dies.</p>
<p>Not knowing what the plot really was, I went in thinking that this was going to be in the vein of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Girl_vs._Frankenstein_Girl">Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl</a> or <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/movie-review-hobo-with-a-shotgun/">Hobo with a Shotgun</a>: a campy, slasher gore film that wasn&#39;t anything to be taken too seriously. What I got instead was a very well thought out and well put together movie that happened to have a cliche plot line. There were some bits that were a little bit over the top, but the theme was definitely played very seriously.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the movie, there are some 42 entrants in these gory games and, while most don&#39;t receive much in the line of attention when they&#39;re killed off, some groups and individuals get their own little arcs. One group of girls has holed themselves up in a lighthouse on one of the island&#39;s coasts. There&#39;s a group of nerds who find themselves a shack and, thanks to the power of brains and hacking, wreak havok upon their captor&#39;s via electronic warfare while attempting to sneak in a homemade bomb. Yet another girl goes rogue on her own, killing without hesitation. She&#39;s on her period, apparently, so perhaps it&#39;s semi-justified. Of course, there&#39;s the two protagonists (one of whom is the actor for Light Yagami in the live action Death Note movie) who find themselves at the mercy of one of the game&#39;s previous winners.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the way that the movie explores the dynamics of these groups/individuals and how they attempt to cope with the situation (or don&#39;t) that make this movie so intriguing. Friends are enemies and enemies just might be friends. Trust is an item best given out carefully, if indeed at all. The main characters interface with most all of these circles of individuals to varying degrees and effect, and provides for the main drive of the plot narrative.</p>
<p>And, as a quick note, I didn&#39;t have the usual issues I have with Japanese live action movies with this film. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but their cinematography language is different than what you see in the usual blockbusters. Often, it seems as if their films are shot in cheap equipment, poorly acted, and perhaps shot by amateurs. <em>BR</em> has none of these issues, is well shot, edited, and acted.</p>
<p>As stated before, I was not really expecting much of this movie, but am so glad I went in with an open mind and watched it. It was highly entertaining and a great way to spend a lortab addled evening.</p>

I get to watch the Price is Right in the morning and Let&#39;s Make a Deal in the afternoon. Both shows are highly similar in format and hosted by Whose Line veterans, but Deal seems to be where all the weirdos go what with all their costumes and what such.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I managed to stick to my guns and purchased nothing extraneous last week. Food and gas were the only items money was shelled out for. I&#39;m going to duplicate that trend this week.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I did some walking almost every day last week and crammed in nearly ten miles of it yesterday. I feel my overall calorie intake was lower than usual as well. Also, I mention it every time I write this, but still doing well on keeping away from McD&#39;s and TBell. I note this because I was eating there for late night snacks three to four times a week in the later months of last year. That I haven&#39;t been to either place in nearly two months is kind of a big deal. I&#39;m not even craving them anymore which is more surprising. This is certainly a boon to my overall health and indeed my pocket book.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I haven&#39;t been studying, that much I can say. I do keep myself immersed in small ways, though, by reading kana that I come across. I even had a brief all Japanese conversation with my brother last week. This week I will do at the very least thirty minutes of studying every day, an hour preferable. That I have a basic grasp of the language is more crucial now that the trip to Japan is set in stone.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Seriously, I&#39;m just going to drop this one. There are too many other things that I rank higher in importance (that have money invested in them) over improving my art skills.</p>

<p>I think John Hughes films may have been the conversation that sparked my <a href="http://whatshouldmattwatch.com">movie watch list</a>, so it&#39;s only fitting that I start at the beginning. That and the library just happened to have it on the particular day I strolled in. On blu-ray, even.</p>
<p>For those who may have been like me and have no clue what this movie is about, it&#39;s about a certain Samantha Baker and her sixteenth birthday. Or, rather, how everybody forgets it&#39;s her sixteenth birthday, primarily because it also happens to be the eve of her air-headed sister&#39;s birthday. The first act of the movie is essentially a slice-of-life type bit about Sam as she mopes about in adolescence. She&#39;s not popular in school, is overly conscious of her &quot;under development&quot;, and crushes on a guy that doesn&#39;t even know she exists, a certain Jake Ryan. Thanks to her interactions with the male protagonist - credited as &quot;The Geek&quot; but also referred to as &quot;Farmer Ted&quot; - she eventually makes it into the heart of Jake while &quot;Ted&quot; gets Jake&#39;s previous girlfriend. Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KezvwARhBIc">Kuni</a> shows up and is generally awesome.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m going to rant about a few things, but I want to make it clear that Sixteen Candles is a good movie and one that I definitely enjoyed. It&#39;s a heart-warming little flick with good characters, good humor, and a bit of drama. All the actors convey believable performances and, despite it obviously being set in the 80s, the movie carries an almost timeless feel to it. The themes here are universal even if the outcome is not.</p>
<p>Now to some musing. Thar be spoilers ahead. [break]</p>
<p><strong>Hooking Up</strong>
First up is the pairings that we&#39;re left with at the end of the movie. That Sam and Jake couple up at all isn&#39;t entirely believable, mostly from Jake&#39;s side. Yes, we&#39;re shown that he wanted more relationship than his party hard girlfriend could provide, but the &quot;glance across the room and see Ms. Perfect&quot; is such a tired cliche. This one glance and is enough for him stalk her out in a yearbook, cold call her house (multiple times), and loan out his girlfriend and his dad&#39;s Roll Royce to an underage and unlicensed stranger (Farmer Ted) all for a shot at Sam is too much. Stemming from that, his girlfriend is all okay with this and even falls for our cultivator of cabbages after a night of drunken sex in the back of the car. Yes, it&#39;s a movie, but certainly they could have arrived at this outcome in a less contrived manner.</p>
<p><strong>Team Edward</strong>
Seriously. The guy who plays Jake looks <em>uncannily</em> like that Edward dude from the Twilight series.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/edward_question_mark.jpg" alt="" title="Maybe he is some sort of ancient sparkly vampire..."></p>
<p><strong>PG?</strong>
We all know that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was the first movie to receive the PG-13 rating, presumably for overt graphic violence that wasn&#39;t enough to be R rated. I couldn&#39;t say, I&#39;ve never managed to stay awake through the whole movie. But, I digress. Sixteen Candles may not have graphic violence, but it has much swearing and even a couple of extended shots of some perky boobies that would have been contained full frontal had the actress turned two degrees towards the camera. Now, this is not a complaint. I&#39;m a red blooded male who swears like I own the seven seas, but seeing that there were <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weeks+between+may+4%2C+1984+and+may+25%2C+1984">3 weeks</a> between the release of Indy and Sixteen Candles, I&#39;m a bit surprised that the latter didn&#39;t get the honor of first to PG-13.</p>
<p><strong>On the subject of boobies...</strong>
I&#39;m going off on a bit of a tangent here, but a recurring theme in much of the media I consume is female characters lamenting the size of their chests, particularly in the earlier letters of the alphabet. Perhaps it&#39;s just me (and the subject is certainly subjective), but literal melon sized breasts are hardly appealing. I&#39;d rather have gold, boron, or carbon over the synthetic darmstadtium or dubnium.</p>
<p>Well, that got weird...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Movie Review - Hobo with a Shotgun</h2><time>February 11, 2013</time><div><p>There&#39;s no reason to reiterate the fact that I created a <a href="http://whatshouldmattwatch.com/">site where people can recommend movies for me to watch</a>. You&#39;ve probably heard all about it already. The first movie for me to watch off this list was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo_With_A_Shotgun">Hobo with a Shotgun</a>, suggested by my French buddy Mickael.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O96vm9J.jpg" alt="" title="Hobo with a Shotgun"></p>
<p>Our film starts out with the titular Hobo - who never actually receives a name - rolling into a town presumably in Canada. The opening music is chipper, the sky is a highly saturated blue, and life in general seems to be just swell. Three minutes later, some dude has shoved down a manhole, a rope tossed around his neck, and a truck yanking his head off. It rains blood and some random chick in a bikini dances in it. This pretty much sets the tone for the remainder of the film until until our Hobo friend gets sick and tired of the wanton killing that seems to plague the town. He buys himself a shotgun and becomes the hero that Namelessville deserves. Oh, and he also befriends a stripper along the way.</p>
<p>Hobo with a Shotgun is pretty much everything I anticipated it would be; campy, cheesy, and violent for the sake of violence. There&#39;s no message, no point, just an excuse to watch people get their hands shoved into the whirling blade of a lawn mower. Which actually leads me to a musing. Along the way, Mr. Hobo gets letters carved into his chest with a knife, beat up, and stomped repeatedly by a dude wearing ice skates. But does that keep our intrepid protagonist down? No, not really, no. Give him a night of sleep and he&#39;s back up like nothing happened. Even his stripper companion nearly gets her head <em>sawed off</em>, but a couple hours in the ER and all is right again. Dialogue is equally cheesy, culminating in a scene where the Hobo is addressing babies in a hospital nursery about the bleak future and that, with any luck, they won&#39;t become a hobo with a shotgun like him.</p>
<p>The visual effects are relatively decent, I guess. I mean, once you&#39;ve seen one movie with tons of blood and gore, you&#39;ve seen most of them. Nothing too new or interesting here. Every scene seems to be hyper saturated, creating many shots that look almost mono- or dual-chromatic. Example on that last point, the finale is lit with a cyan light on one half and an orange on the other. After the extreme color correction, the effect is kind of nifty.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a pretty stupid movie. Everything was over the top and an obvious homage to the exploitation films of yore. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it to anybody unless they get a kick out of mindless violence.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong> - 2.5/5</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention the part where one of the baddies burns a bus full of kids with Disco Inferno playing in the background. Nothing more need be said.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Week Lemon</h2><time>February 10, 2013</time><div><p>I&#39;ve lost count and these haven&#39;t been weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I spent the most money I&#39;ve ever spent this week. More on that in a moment. I have purchased all the Japanese items I shall for the month ($25 worth of light novels and manga). Bought some new shoes because every pair I had were quite literally falling apart at the seems. Also did a small Saturday project wherein I resurfaced my table... and the cleaning supplies I needed to clean said mess. This week I aim to buy nothing other than food needed to survive and gasoline if need be.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Still haven&#39;t been to either McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell, so good on that front. Only went to a couple restaurants this week, though Friday&#39;s escapades were donuts and cheese steaks, so take it as you will. Really have fallen off the walking wagon and I need to be working harder at that (can&#39;t let Mr. Helton take the top spot all the time). Yesterday, while walking to Walmart to acquire a sander, I forgot my fitbit half way there and had to turn around and try again. So my step count isn&#39;t 100% accuratly reflected.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing and Japanese</strong> - Nothing to report.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - The tickets have been purchased and we&#39;re set to go the first week of June. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PyQbAA0BFs5QIqFVZ7t9rmRTyDF2qcqoa7qa4AHPVQQ/edit">We&#39;re currently penning a document of stuff we&#39;d like to do</a>. This is happening.</p>
<p>For real, dog.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Week 5</h2><time>February 3, 2013</time><div><p><strong>Finances</strong> - Resisting the urge to buy something when you know you can <em>afford</em> but don&#39;t actually <em>need</em> it is quite frustrating. However, I have done well on resisting the urge for the most part. I did line up a couple things for pre-order and have settled on the number of $50/mo to satisfy my urge to purchase Japanese items. Also, unbeknownst to me, Amazon decided that they would charge me for Prime without notice once my trial had ended. Now I have Prime. Generally when it comes to online ordering, I trade patience for money and go with the cheapest shipping option, but I guess that&#39;s moot now. Also, I&#39;ll probably be purchasing from Amazon instead of rightstuf just so I can somewhat justify the money they have taken from me. I did do some spontaneous &quot;gifting&quot; of things last week, which was some money gone not planned. That shouldn&#39;t, however, become anything regular.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Lackluster week on the exercise front. I did not get out for the usual afternoon walks as often as I should have which also caused Mr. Helton to pull ahead of me in steps. I&#39;m putting my foot down on that this week (get it?). I&#39;ve still managed to stay away from most fast food, a trip to Cici&#39;s with my family notwithstanding. Interestingly, I haven&#39;t even had the urge for the late night McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell trip. Or even to go there at all. I&#39;ve done my best to have <em>something</em> hanging around the house for when those urges occur, usually in the form of some kind of sandwich. Or delicious bread pudding. It&#39;s not good for me, but at least it&#39;s not processed, right?</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Not too much new here. I did get <a href="http://kanacards.us">Kanacards</a> to a (mostly) usable state and have been doing vocab drills with that. There&#39;s still some development to go to make it full featured and sand down the rough edges, but it can and shall be used. The most difficult thing I&#39;m finding, however, is that my Genki book is a text book but there&#39;s no syllabus to go with it. So, I&#39;m trudging along as best I can.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I hooked my Wacom back up to my computer at some point this week.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Week 4</h2><time>January 27, 2013</time><div><p>Missed last week because... well, just because I felt like it.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - It has been two weeks since my last Taco Bell trip and I haven&#39;t even eaten McDonald&#39;s in the 2013 year, so we&#39;re doing well there. Didn&#39;t walk as much as I&#39;d wanted this week, but got out every weekday last week. Also, I invested in a <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/one">fitbit</a> to keep track of all my exercise related things. It&#39;s a nifty little device and has pitted me in heated combat with a certain <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/">Morgan Helton</a>. It also tracks my sleeping habits by measuring my movements during sleep. If I read the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/user/24DRCF/sleep">graph right</a>, I could make a convincing dead man once I lose consciousness for the day. Probably also explains why I never have dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Well, I did buy the fitbit, but I figure if it&#39;s in the interest of any item on this list, it&#39;s worth shelling out money for. Otherwise, I&#39;ve kept a reign in for the most part, especially on eating out (which has been mostly relegated to the weekends). It&#39;s getting harder and harder not to pre-order some of the shows I want to own, though. I may time them out to once a month or something.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did a couple of worksheets in my book, but have not spent near enough time on this. However, I began work on a <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/kanacards">web app</a> to help drill vocabulary. My brother who is also taking Japanese (at a real college) will be sharing this tool with me and we can learn from each other.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Have you ever noticed that central time seems so much more logical than any of the other timezones? Prime time starts at 7pm, usually right around the time the evening meal is ending and you&#39;re ready to just relax for a while. You don&#39;t get that in the eastern timezone.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Anime Reviewaganza - Fresh Blood</h2><time>January 23, 2013</time><div><p>As stated, taking a really relaxed pace this year. Today, I&#39;d like to welcome Steve - yet another of my many, many brothers - to our little band of reviews. Today we&#39;ll be delving into the characters that did and didn&#39;t do it for us.</p>
<h2 id="worst-character">Worst Character</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_hina.jpg" alt="" title="Hina Takanashi">
[b]Chris - <em>Hina Takanashi (Listen to Me, Girls, I am Your Father)</em>[/b]
Holy gay sex, Batman, if I hated one character more than any in 2012, it was Hina Takanashi.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering how I can find it within myself to hate a character who is a mere three years old. Kids are adorable, right? Not universally, because her character annoyed me to such a degree I could hardly bear it at times.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the voice, because whatever old wench they got to voice this character poured every ounce of wince inducing vocalization she could into this character. Real children have high pitched voices, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they&#39;re not grating in the way this one is, and real three year olds certainly don&#39;t speak with the mental capacity of someone much older.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s another thing: this kid is far too rational when it comes to emotional matters. Whilst the rest of the characters have a hard time coping with the death of their mother/sister, Hina spends one minute down at the very end crying about it before she grows a pair entirely too large for her age/gender and spouts off some sort of psychiatrist shit and immediately learns to cope with the fact that her parents are DEAD. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this kid popped out of the fucking womb with a doctorate in psychology.</p>
<p>And for the love of God, will the other characters just stop giving her dick shaped food?[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_sako.jpg" alt="" title="Shuntarou Sako">
[b]Matt - <em>Sako Shuntarou (Listen to Me, Girls, I am Your Father)</em>[/b]
This character - a fat ass, creepy, pedophile guy - is about 50% of everything that was wrong with Papakiki (the other 50% being that the show was written like shit). The way he openly drools over prepubescent girls is not funny and not cute especially considering that two thirds of the female leads fall into this category. What&#39;s possibly even more outrageous than this is the fact that everybody around him are aware of the situation and don&#39;t seem to give enough shits to do anything about it.</p>
<p>There are characters you love to hate. Benjamin Linus from LOST or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYNeT2nzEgA">Joffrey from Game of Thrones</a>, for instance. Part of the intrigue of these characters is they&#39;re so awful that there is some sort of odd pleasure derived from hating on them.</p>
<p>This is not one of those cases and it fills my nerd core with rage.</p>
<h2 id="best-character">Best Character</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_manabe.jpg" alt="" title="Manabe Yoshihisa">
[b]Steve - <em>Manabe Yoshihisa (Kotoura-san)</em>[/b]
Although ‘Kotoura-San&#39; is a brand new anime, only just begun, Manabe has quickly shot to the top of my ‘Favorite Anime Character&#39; list. He may be an extremely pervy guy (aren&#39;t we all?) but he&#39;s the only one who can accept Kotoura as a human, something so many people have failed to notice.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, though, I think his most redeeming moment was when he called out that bitch, Miyori Horitani, for making Kotoura toss her cookies...or maybe it&#39;s just because I love it when bitches get what&#39;s coming to them...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_kanna.jpg" alt="" title="Kanna Tanigawa">
[b]Chris - <em>Kanna Tanigawa (Ano Natsu de Matteru)</em>[/b]
This topic was a bit difficult, as there were relatively few standout characters in 2012. But thinking back on everything I watched, I remembered: I really liked Kanna Tanigawa, now I&#39;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>The main couple in Ano Natsu – Kaito and Boobs the alien – were both rather devoid of character; if I were to compare them to cereal, they would be Weetabix, or some shit. Cardboard, in other words, although I bare them no ill will.</p>
<p>Oh wait, FUCK YES I DO.</p>
<p>Sidelined in these shmuck&#39;s little love game is Kanna – she wants Kaito, and she wants him bad. This is made clear from the very beginning, and despite all of her hint dropping and final passionate confession, Kaito brushes her off as if she means nothing, as if he feels nothing – of course, that&#39;s probably not far from the truth.</p>
<p>So throughout the majority of the show, Kanna is hurting emotionally, and all because she has the balls to show some goddamn character and show some real affection for someone who is completely incapable of reciprocating anything but apathy. I sympathize with her, I care about her plight, and, despite my own opinion of her love interest, I&#39;m rooting for her because, goddammit, she&#39;s a fun, cute, and likeable character.</p>
<p>Kanna will always have a fan in me, until the bitter end.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_yamada.jpg" alt="" title="Yamada">
[b]Matt - <em>Yamada (B Gata H Kei: Yamada&#39;s First Time)</em>[/b]
I wanted to limit all the main lists to shows that aired in 2012, but I&#39;ve got to bend the rules slightly for this one. Yes, there were many, many cute characters from this year, and <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/bracket_round8.jpg?v6">awwnime bracket</a> winner Rikka Takanashi is certainly a lovable character who even gets some development later in her show, but there really weren&#39;t any real stand outs this year. So, I&#39;m going to rewrite the rule to include shows localized and released in 2012.</p>
<p>Enter the titular character from B Gata H Kei - Yamada&#39;s First Time.</p>
<p>I love to describe Yamada as a slut doing her damnedest to be a whore, but utterly failing in every regard. She&#39;s rude, crass, and a genius in the vein of stupidity. Her wildly outlandish schemes never fail to elicit laughs and the dub performance and localization job by the Funimation crew makes it even more hilarious. On paper, the idea of a character setting out on her “life goal” of nailing 100 guys sounds absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>In execution, it&#39;s hysterical.</p>
<p>One more set to go. Stay tuned.[/b]</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Weekly Accountability Report - Week 2 (Meh)</h2><time>January 14, 2013</time><div><p>Here we are at yet another completed week within this new year and with it a report of how I managed to uphold the standards of which I set myself to.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - On the upside, I managed to keep my eating of fast food to a minimum; one trip to Taco Bell late one evening. However, the pizza that work brought in on Friday probably negates that. I&#39;ve also found out that no amount of granola bars will stave off hunger for very long. In the world of exercise, I did manage at least 45 minutes of walking every work day, no small feat considering the cold turn the weather has made. I need to add something more into the mix, though, be it treadmill, push ups, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - There were actually a couple days last week where I didn&#39;t spend any money at all. Score! The purchasing of some poster frames and a limited pressing of the <a href="http://iamshark.limitedrun.com/products/508090-star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace-ost-2xlp-limited">Episode I soundtrack on LP</a> were the only real unnecessary buys last week. I successfully did stave off the desire to purchase a couple of manga this weekend, so score. I&#39;m going to try and Scrooge it the rest of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did an hours worth of work two days last week. There were plenty of times I thought about picking them up later on only to take a nap instead. I have no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Yeah...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Anime Reviewaganza - Bests, Worsts, and Beyond</h2><time>January 9, 2013</time><div><p>Taking a bit slower pace on rolling these out this year, but here&#39;s another page of anime reviews.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-surprise">Biggest Surprise</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_my_little_monster.jpg" alt="" title="My Little Monster">
[b]Chris - <em>My Little Monster</em>[/b]
When 2012 started, little did I know that I would close out the year by watching a shoujo title, which -- let&#39;s not beat around the bush here -- are made for girls.  But I did.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>What I found in My Little Monster was a great little romcom with some great characters and a good -- if not flip-floppy -- central romance.  While the show&#39;s shoujo roots are apparent in the art style, most everything in the show is enjoyable even by manly men.  Best of all, there was no gaggle of wooden male characters -- I&#39;m looking at you Hiiro no Kakera.</p>
<p>The only real problem I had was the somewhat disappointing ending, or rather, the lack of an ending.  Few of the plot threads were wrapped up, leading me to hope that a second season is around the corner -- and let me tell you, I would love to see that.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_pet_girl.jpg" alt="" title="The Pet Girl of Sakurasou">
[b]Matt - <em>The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</em>[/b]
In a show that has the phrase &quot;pet girl&quot; in it, one&#39;s expectations certainly can&#39;t be high. There are certainly many shows where said phrase would be quite apt (anything from the harem genre), but to blatantly state as much in the title, one can only assume the worst. Matters aren&#39;t made any better when the previews make a point out of the fact that our bumbling heroine protagonist, autist deluxe, and aforementioned &quot;pet girl&quot;, has issues performing such simple tasks as dressing herself. The only reason I even watched an episode was to see just how low they were actually going to go.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, these moments are relatively scarce and, for the most part, play themselves out by the end of the first episode. What we&#39;re left with is a story about finding one&#39;s niche, pursuing one&#39;s passions, envy and jealousy, and learning to adapt to living around people who are insanely talented. The cast of characters, while adhering to the usual tropes, are varied and interesting and the dynamics between them make for an enjoyable watch. The titular character is still the least likable of the bunch, being far too inept to be likeable (and made more annoying in that she&#39;ll wind up being the protagonist&#39;s primary love interest, no doubt). All in all, though, it&#39;s an entertaining show that certainly could have been worse and I plan to continue watching to its conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="biggest-disappointment">Biggest Disappointment</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_kokoro_connect.jpg" alt="" title="Kokoro Connect">
[b]Chris - <em>Kokoro Connect</em>[/b]
This show should have been bad ass, and in some ways it was.  Following a group of high school students as some funky jack ass screws with their lives in various ways, the premise was solid and complemented by a solid set of characters, notably Taichi and Inaba.  Unfortunately, the execution was less than stellar plot-wise.</p>
<p>The shows first arc was extremely promising, with the group swapping bodies at random and experiencing the other characters lives first hand, culminating in the aforementioned funky jack ass taking control of one character and having her jump off a bridge because he was fucking bored.  Seems great, right?  It is, until all dramatic tension is removed by making everything turn out fine and dandy.</p>
<p>This plot structure with the dramatic build up and anti-climactic end persists into the second arc, but fails to show up to the party for the third.  When the characters are randomly turning into children and they try to play it up for serious, you know that drama was left at the door, and what little remained was swept under the table in an ending so weak I was left to wonder if I had actually seen the last episode.</p>
<p>It&#39;s one thing for an OK show to have a mediocre ending -- such was the case with Another in the Winter season -- but when a show starts off great, with a good premise and solid characters, then squanders all of its potential, you end up feeling empty inside, robbed even.</p>
<p>Hopefully the OVA can salvage some of the happy feelings I felt early on.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_papakiki.jpg" alt="" title="Papakiki">
[b]Matt - <em>Listen to Me, Girls, I&#39;m am you Father</em>[/b]
<em>Listen to me girls, I am your father</em>, or Papakiki, has a promising set up; series protagonist Yuuta Segawa takes over guardianship of his three nieces after their parents are (presumably) killed in a plane accident. My immediate thought was that this would be similar to last year&#39;s Bunny Drop, an incredibly well made show that encompasses the hardships and rewards of parenthood. Hell, even my mom loves it.</p>
<p>While Papakiki does indeed attempt incorporate some of these elements, it also has all the elements of an incestuous harem show. Any kind of emotion evoked by the makeshift family trying to adjust to their new life is immediately shattered by the eldest girl&#39;s completely illogical infatuation with her uncle (of course, they pull the not-related-by-blood card here). Or the fat sack of shit pedophile guy ogling over a three-year-old. Or Hina (aforementioned toddler) sticking yet another dick shaped food in her mouth. Moments such as this far outweigh any good ones. This show should have either gone 100% ecchi fanservice (allowing me to safely avoid it), or done like Bunny Drop and focus tell a heartwarming little tale about the joys and sorrows of family life.</p>
<p>It&#39;s trying to do both and utterly fails on all fronts.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-fuck-did-i-watch-that-">Why the Fuck Did I Watch That?</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_papakiki.jpg" alt="" title="Papakiki... again">
[b]Chris - <em>Listen to Me, Girls, I&#39;m am you Father</em>[/b]
I&#39;ll be honest, I know why I started watching this show initially.</p>
<p>Cute promo art.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the premise of the young male protagonist raising his sister&#39;s children after she tragically dies in a plane crash seemed ripe with dramatic possibilities.  Seems okay, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Every week I was assaulted with an annoying female lead throwing herself all over the protagonist and then slapping him for no other reason than he was there.  Worse still, I had to endure the grating voice of the youngest character -- who, I might add, held wisdom and emotional stability far outclassing her three year old physical age -- and watch as everybody gave her suggestively shaped food items to much on.   Adding insult to injury, all of the tough emotional problems were solved unrealistically in one episode, but not without shit tons of fluff padding the whole thing out.</p>
<p>I stated on multiple occasions that I was probably going to drop this show, and now I wonder why I didn&#39;t.  Nothing ventured nothing gained, they say, but in this case I ventured and gained shit.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll stick with nothing.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews12_mysterious_girlfriend.jpg" alt="" title="Mysterious Girlfriend X">
[b]Matt - <em>Mysterious Girlfriend X</em>[/b]
In brief summary, Mysterious Girlfriend X is a basic high school romance with lots of saliva swapping. And I don&#39;t mean kissing, mind you. In the entirety of the show, lips never touch. No, instead spit - displayed as being a glistening, syrup like substance complete with tinkly sound effects - is physically removed from one mouth and placed in another. Somehow, thoughts and feelings are transferred with the liquid exchange. We&#39;re initially led to believe that this is something that only the female lead can do. Combined with the numerous close-ups of her UFO bag charm, I figured she&#39;s an alien or something. I guess the reveal to why she&#39;s so &quot;mysterious&quot; is what I was hanging on for. But, there was no reveal. Apparently, saliva has magical properties in the world of this show, because other people start doing it later. In the end, nothing is explained, relationships don&#39;t go anywhere, and you&#39;re just left with a nasty, creepy feeling.</p>
<p>Two more posts to go, we&#39;ll try and get them out before the end of the month.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Accountability Report - Week 1 (Off to a Roaring Stop)</h2><time>January 6, 2013</time><div><p>It&#39;s time for the first installment of my public shaming, an activity aimed at keeping me on the straight and narrow for my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/hindsight-is-2012/">New Year&#39;s resolutions</a>.</p>
<p>And what a shaming I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I have eaten out several times this week (once being Taco Bell) and had a drinking party last night. Granted, my brother is in town and we&#39;re celebrating New Year&#39;s a bit belatedly, so I&#39;m going to write it off this once. On the upside, I have made more food and not had McDonald&#39;s in this thirteenth year of the 21st century.[break]</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - The last of my pre-ordered items came rolling in and I bought the Mac mini that I&#39;d been planning on buying anyways (with any luck, I can make that money back on the App Store). The slate for purchasing goods is now empty with nothing on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - My books have arrived and I will begin in earnest tomorrow evening... just as soon as I figure out how to proceed...</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - This certainly doesn&#39;t need its own section, but since my brother was in town, we hashed many of the details. The date has been formalized and tickets will be purchased very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I drew but on thing from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily">/r/sketchdaily</a> and that was the one posted on the 1st. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pCMJM.jpg">It&#39;s supposed to be a snake, but it just looks like shit</a>. Need to get back into this.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s where things lie. Hopefully this coming week will be a little better in that it will be a standard week with no deviations from the normal routine. (I still love you though, Chris...)</p>

The categories are changed up slightly from last year, but remain more or less the same. But, enough intro, here&#39;s Chris and I&#39;s favorite tunes of the year.</p>

<p>It would be inaccurate to state that I know how to explain music, or why I like certain songs more than others. Unfortunately, my cognitive capacity for this activity is far outweighed by the naturalness of describing things assaulting my other, far more supple senses.</p>
<p>But here goes.</p>
<p>This song kicks ass – I can’t explain why, but that is the way of things, and that is how they are. Also, there’s some pretty kick-flippin’ animation in the opener that probably rivaled in budget the entirety of Space Brothers.</p>
<p>OH, SNAP.[break]</p>

<p>I will not lie; I chose this song solely because it had the most play counts for the year (281 as of this writing). However, it is entirely deserving of this position. Both the music, which is at the same time both powerful and gentle, and the opening visuals are pretty fantastic. The visuals in particular are dripping with a design aesthetic that could only come from studio SHAFT (coincidentally, they’re also responsible for [my best OP pick last year/0.jpg)](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DXTk9gtOHY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DXTk9gtOHY</a>]</p>

<p>You know what sucks? That’s a secret, but I’ll tell you what doesn’t suck: this song.</p>
<p>Dog.</p>
<p>It starts out unassuming enough, one of those songs where it will pop up in your sub-conscious every now and then but doesn’t really stick with you. THEN you get to refrain and fuckin’ hear, “BEEEEELIEEEEEEVE,” and your life will never fucking by the same AGAIN.</p>
<p>300 plays in the span of a month do not lie and it certainly says something about this song’s incredibly addictive nature.</p>
<p>I would make a comment about the aforementioned refrain making my DICK super ROCK HARD, but that wouldn’t be gentlemanly.</p>

Again, chosen by listening habits (164 plays). I suppose that this method of choosing is not entirely fair since this show was released in the winter season, but in a season that was pretty bleak on the music front, this one stood head and shoulders above everything else (and also pretty much the only good thing to come out of this show). Much like my OP pick, the animation for this is comprised of a lot of bright solids (I like that, so sue me), but the music itself is very, very different. Where Euphoric Field is a kind of orchestral rock piece, Coloring is 100% synth pop. And I enjoy synth pop sometimes. It’s all about diversity.</p>

<p>The year is coming to a close yet again and with it the usual <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2012-things-to-do-before-we-all-die/">self reflective post</a> for my future self to gaze upon. Also, the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/best-of-anime-awards-finale/">anime reviews</a> will kick in soon. Not that anybody cares, but it makes for an interesting read later on. But, without further ado, let&#39;s see how I did on last year&#39;s list of self improvements and what to look forward to in 2013. I hadn&#39;t counted on this seeing as we were all supposed to die a couple weeks back...[break]</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-productivity">A note on productivity</h2>
<p>Before I begin eviscerating myself for, again, not adhering to the goals I set out for myself in the previous year&#39;s worth of days, I want to note the brighter part of the year, namely that 2012 was probably the most productive programming year I&#39;ve had in a long, long time. You&#39;ve been privvy to a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/christmas-lights-extravaganza/">lot</a> of the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">personal projects</a> I&#39;ve engaged in, but I also got a lot of shit done at work (compared to the previous year where most of my time at Winnercomm was spent on projects that eventually got canned). Not only did I rewrite or re-engineer in some way nearly every page on our <a href="http://www.newson6.com/">main news sites</a>, but I also wrote our <a href="http://m.newson6.com/">new mobile sites</a> from the ground up, taking control back from a third party. 2013 is going to be difficult to live up to in terms of programming, but the almost guaranteed return of the awwnime bracket (which garnered over a quarter million votes by the time it wrapped) and work officially carving out some time for game development, it should be an interesting one.</p>
<p>Okay, enough back patting. Now for the self-deprecation!</p>
<h2 id="2012-s-goals">2012&#39;s Goals</h2>
<p><strong>MOAR EXERCISE</strong> - On the whole, I didn&#39;t do terribly in the exercise department. I&#39;ve been a bit lax lately, what with the cold weather and such, but I managed to lose ~15 pounds from my heaviest point this year, so I guess there&#39;s that. Also, 45 minutes of walking at 3.5mph doesn&#39;t affect me near the way it used to. I&#39;m going to label this one as OKAY, which is to say not a failure nor a success.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR GAMING</strong> - From the list I provided, only Skyward Sword and the Left 4 Deads were completed. I did make some headway on Catherine and never even touched the others. However, I did do a fair amount of gaming and acquired two new consoles, a 3DS XL and Wii U. I also played a lot of visual novels, but I&#39;m not sure if that really counts as &quot;gaming&quot; or not. Mostly reading, I suppose. I&#39;ll again chalk this one up as OKAY.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR SOCIALIZING</strong> - Compared to 2011, I was pretty social this year. I went on a combined total of four dates between two girls before putting my foot down on any more dates with either. I also went outside of my normal bubble of do-nothing weekends and spontaneously agreed to a trip to six flags with some friends from work (doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal, but spontaneity is not my strong suit). I also did some volunteer work in a charity program my company runs. Granted, there wasn&#39;t much socializing going on there, but I was outside the house and amoungst a group of people. Finally, and perhaps this is a negative, but I enjoy the social niche of the /r/awwnime guys. It&#39;s kind of like the old YPN days in a way. To the original point of joining some organized, recurring group, I failed. But I think I made up for it in other regards. Either way, I&#39;m going to label this one as simply OKAY.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR DRAWING</strong> - A handful of comics notwithstanding, I hardly drew a single thing this year. FAILED</p>
<h2 id="onwards-towards-2013">Onwards Towards 2013</h2>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - The trend of exercise must maintain or increase. But, more importantly than that, my eating habits have got to change. The late night runs to McDonald&#39;s and Taco Bell <em>must stop</em>. I need to be making more meals at home and healthier meals at that. The goal I&#39;m going to set for myself is to be 200lbs when I sit down to write this post at the end of the year. That&#39;s 20lbs less than I am now, more than doable.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I made a lot of unnecessary purchases in 2013. <strong>A lot</strong>. I must make the note that never once did I spend outside of my means and am even ahead in YTD funds, but the amount of money I spent on anime alone could have paid off my credit card. Or a large chunk of the remaining loan on my car. That&#39;s just anime. Gaming purchases, random one-off items, and eating out combined probably rival that number a couple times over. My goal for this year is to pay off in full three major bills: car, credit card, and the LASIK loan. Between those three, that&#39;s an extra $600 a month that I can begin throwing at my insane student loan debt, the ultimate goal there being to have those paid off by 2018 at the very latest.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - This is something I actually attempted last year in earnest by trying to take a course at a local community college (an insane amount of very specific circumstances prevented my entry). I&#39;ve also made some lame attempts in the past to learn and can speak and write the language on a very, very basic level. However, I need to either shit or get off the pot, so I&#39;ve ordered myself some honest to god text books and will be giving this high focus this year.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - My two oldest brothers and I have been entertaining this one for years and, in hindsight, 2012 would have been the best year to pursue it. However, with us getting older and everybody losing time to responsibilities, it&#39;s only going to get more difficult from here out. I feel that if the trip doesn&#39;t happen in 2013, it may very well not happen at all.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing (yet again)</strong> - This has been on the list for three years running, now. However, my approach was wrong. My start and my goal were to draw comic and Japanese styles better when, in reality, I should be shooting to become a better over all artist. Aside from a self-defeatist attitude, not knowing what exactly to draw has also been a major problem which in turn leads to not drawing at all. So, what I&#39;m going to do this year is partake in the subreddit known as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/">SketchDaily</a>, wherein they provide a subject for you to sketch everyday. This is a good way to provide with something to draw and encourage persistence.</p>
<p>Finally, tying all of these things together will be <strong>PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY</strong>. It&#39;s easy to say you&#39;ll do something and then conveniently ignore it because you&#39;re the only one holding yourself accountable. For a better man, this is all you&#39;d need, but I am not a better man. I thrive off of public image much more than one should, but if it keeps me on the path I have laid out before myself, so much the better. So, I will be posting here the results from above in the form of weekly sketch dumps, what I&#39;ve learned in teaching myself Japanese, and maybe some periodic updates on exercise and the avoidance of cheap McDonald&#39;s food. Lying on the internet is easy, but luckily that&#39;s one vice I&#39;ve managed to rid myself of and lying to a bunch of people you know and talk to in person makes the whole thing a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve rambled on long enough. Congratulations on surviving the apocalypse and here&#39;s to a long and prosperous 2013!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Christmas Lights Extravaganza</h2><time>December 23, 2012</time><div><p>I&#39;ve been sitting on this one for a while now. I&#39;m sure everybody&#39;s seen the video, but I&#39;ve been meaning to do a technical writeup. In case you haven&#39;t seen the video and have no idea what I&#39;m talking about: I made a computer controlled lights setup. You can watch it below:</p>
<p>[![youtube video](<a href="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ufCdZ3xzuUY">https://img.youtube.com/vi/ufCdZ3xzuUY</a>]</p>

<p>Okay, now that we have that out of the way, follow the break for the technical goodies.[break]</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>Certainly I mentioned it [some time ago)(<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/arduino-project-1-taiko-march/">http://dxprog.com/entry/arduino-project-1-taiko-march/</a>), but at the heart of this project is an Arduino Uno. Actually, there are two hearts in this case. The other one is a Raspberry Pi, the $35 micro computer. Both of these pieces perform very different roles, but before I delve into that, have a shoddily drawn &quot;schematic&quot; on how all the parts are connected:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tree_lights_schematic.jpg" alt="" title="Grossly simplified"></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick rundown of each component and its use:</p>
<p><strong>Relay/Outlet Box</strong> - This is a gang box that consists of four outlets all hooked up into a relay board (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-4-Channel-Relay-Module-Arduino/dp/B0057OC5O8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1356312659&amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;amp;amp;keywords=relay+board">I used this one</a>). This allows me four separate channels of light control for up to eight strings of lights. The channels in my setup are broken out into the lights on the tree, the star, and two strings of lights on either side of the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Arduino</strong> - The Arduino in this case doesn&#39;t actually do much. It receives commands from the Raspberry Pi via serial communication and toggles the appropriate relay. It also takes input from the button on the proto shield and sends that back to the Pi.</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> - The Pi is what does most all of the heavy lifting. It plays the music and parses the sequence file to send the correct commands to the Arduino at the appropriate time. It&#39;ll also change display modes upon pressing a button on the Arduino. Pressing the button cycles through the following modes: play loaded light sequence, all on, all off.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tree_lights_hardware.jpg" alt="" title="The setup"></p>
<p>That&#39;s the hardware side, let&#39;s move onto the softer side of things.</p>
<h2 id="sequencing">Sequencing</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tree_lights_after_effects.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s like motion graphics for real life"></p>
<p>All of my sequencing was done in After Effects. I setup a basic scene with all my light channels (mapped to approximations of what they&#39;d be in real life) and the song I was sequencing. I used the opacity property to set the on/off state of each string; 0 was off, non-0 on. Sadly, I forgot all about hold frames until I was nearly done, so I have a lot of side-by-side key frames keeping the previous state. The composition was set at a flat 30fps to make time coding easy later. Once I was done sequencing, I copied each layers key frames into a flat text file for compilation later.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>With the hardware and sequencing in place, only code remained. There are three programs used through out the process: one to compile together all the pasted sequences from After Effects into a nice JSON format, the program to parse said file and output data to the Arduino, and the program running on the Arduino itself. Note - there&#39;s not a <em>lot</em> of code, but too much to paste here. I&#39;ve made the entire project available on <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/ChristmasLights">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Parsing After Effects Key Frame Data</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dxprog/ChristmasLights/blob/master/compile.php">This script was written in PHP</a> because it&#39;s what I work with fastest. The keyframes code was slightly augmented to identify what string was what (String ID). It is then time coded and converted into a nice JSON format. The sequence can be found <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/ChristmasLights/blob/master/holy_night.txt">here</a> and the converter program converts it to some nice <a href="https://raw.github.com/dxprog/ChristmasLights/master/holy_night.js">JSON</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Raspberry Pi&#39;s Side</strong></p>
<p>This part was initially written in node.js, but I couldn&#39;t find a good library for playing music and keeping tabs on it&#39;s current position. So, I settled for Python and the PyGame library since both are installed by default in the Pi linux distro. The main loop of the script just sits around waiting for button input. The sequence loop parses the JSON file from above, waiting until the music hits a point that requires action. It then sends out the following byte for each command:</p>
<p>AAAABBBB</p>
<p>The upper four bits are the on/off state and the lower four are the string that the action is to be carried out for. It&#39;s pretty simple and keeps the throughput low.</p>
<p><strong>The Arduino Side</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, the Arduino side is very simple: it sits and waits for commands from the Pi or for the button to be pressed. When it receives one of the command bytes, it breaks it down into the two parts and sends HIGH or LOW for the correct pin taking into consideration the fact that I started on digital pin 4. The Arduino code can be found <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/ChristmasLights/blob/master/controller.ino">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s pretty much everything in a nutshell. Overall, for a first attempt doing really anything like this, I&#39;m quite pleased with the results. Next year, I&#39;d like to get away from the relay board (it&#39;s loud as hell) and use MOSFET which would grant me the ability to do fades and not just on/off. Also, I&#39;d like to expand beyond just four channels and perhaps throw in a RGB LED strip for extra fun.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Letting Go</h2><time>November 26, 2012</time><div><p>My room has always been a mess and myself a bit of a slob. By Aunt May&#39;s reckoning, <a href="http://www.quotefully.com/movie/Spider-Man+(2002">this is the way of brilliant man.</a>/Aunt+May#conversation_0392e37e994611e090c812313b10052d) I think it takes an even <em>more</em> brilliant man to realize that his shit hole of a room needs a thorough cleaning. And it takes an even more brilliant man than that to never let his shit hole get to shit hole state. I&#39;m not brilliant enough to get to that point, but I did clean my room today. And then I realized - there&#39;s only so much cleaning that can be done when there&#39;s no place left for all the shit in said shit hole. That&#39;s when difficult decisions need to be made.</p>
<p>Decisions like recycling that pile of mostly broken computers that you swore one day you&#39;d get working again and turn into a nifty little in house server farm...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/computer_stack.jpg" alt="" title="Of course, you keep the one extra computer that does work... plus a bunch of spare parts"></p>
<p>Also, deciding that your really don&#39;t need your DS Lite, because you have an SP which can play your GBA games, and a 3DS which can play DS games. The extra system - while an extremely sexy piece of hardware - is just redundant. So, you trade that bitch in for $24, 20% of the price that you paid for it.</p>
<p>Or maybe that cord yarn that you bought because you were going to teach yourself how to crochet and make a stuffed Hobbes. Three, actually. One to keep, one for your progeny (pffft), and one to give away. Yup, just need to face facts that it&#39;s not happening.</p>
<p>Some things are a little easier to part with, though. Like a pile of old gaming magazines and course manuals from college. Goodwill&#39;d!</p>
<p>And so, my room is clean and my closet is even clean. Hopefully somebody will put all my old shit to good use or if they throw it away, it won&#39;t be on my conscience.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Weekend of Productivity</h2><time>November 19, 2012</time><div><p>Being single has its upsides. It means I get to such things as lounge around doing <em>jack shit</em> on the days I&#39;m not dancing for the man. I decided to buck that trend this weekend, though, and actually accomplished quite a bit. All of it started with my decision <em>not</em> to hop in line for a Wii U early.</p>
<p>The original idea was to take my brother to work at 2pm and then insert myself into whatever line there was at Walmart (they tell me there&#39;s no dash in that anymore). I was hesitant to say the least. That would have been a near 10 hour wait in a store with only a handful of electronics to keep me company. Despite the fact that I had loaded up a satchel of entertainment, I decided at the last minute to not get in line, resigning myself to not getting a Wii U <em>right now</em>. I could waste my time much more effectively at home.</p>
<p>I actually spent most of the afternoon programming up the last stages of the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/">awwnime bracket</a> to include a wildcard round. In between bouts of frustration, I&#39;d browse around the internet or conversate on IRC, but in the end there were a lot of solid hours of coding done.</p>
<p>Once that was completed, I cleaned my room a little bit and also loaded up the dishwasher from lunch earlier in the day. Then, I caught up on my currently airing shows. I consider this an accomplishment as my laziness has reached heights so high that it feels like a chore to watch television. I think it&#39;s more I don&#39;t like watching shows alone, actually. Not as fun that way.</p>
<p>After retrieving my brother from work, we swung by Walmart to see how long the Wii U line was. The answer to that was a surprising &quot;not very&quot;, and we spent about an hour in a half waiting before walking out with the last available Deluxe unit. I thank the good lord that I decided against the ten hour wait as the 90 minutes we did spend were pretty damned stressful in their own right.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent a goodly bit of time working out the final technical details of my computerized lights setup and began sequencing my first display to music (more info on that soon). I even spent some time chatting with the maternal unit and baked up some cookies. Also shipped my brand new Wii U off for repair because the disc drive doesn&#39;t like reading discs (sucks). But, c&#39;est la vie.</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty damned productive weekend. More productive than I&#39;ve had in a goodly long time.</p>

<p>My love for programming and continuing fascination with anime has lead to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/its-like-nes-emulator-dev-all-over/">projects</a> in the past. I&#39;ve also worked on projects that were related to whatever <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/whew/">online social circles</a> I was involved with <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/mp-skin-studio-tutorial/">at the time</a>. I seem to have found something that covers all of these at once.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/">r/awwnime</a>, a subreddit whose sole existence is to pass around pictures of cute characters from various anime. Doesn&#39;t exactly sound like a pool of awesome programming project ideas, but one would be surprised. This little subreddit of waifus and awws has inspired no less than four very different projects. I had been kicking around the idea of an awwni.me URL for a few days, so when <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/svdl3/sleepover_madoka_magica/c4hfs7k?context=3">this comment came along</a>, I said &quot;fuck it&quot;, dropped a few bucks and registered it.</p>
<h2 id="project-1-eyebleach-alternative">Project 1 - Eyebleach Alternative</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://awwni.me">awwni.me</a> base site isn&#39;t much. It grabs the latest posts from the subreddit and displays it with basic slideshow style controls. Nothing too elaborate, but it lives up to its initial idea of being an anime alternative to <a href="http://eyebleach.com/">eyebleach</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-2-post-title-analysis">Project 2 - Post Title Analysis</h2>
<p>This one was entirely curiosity on my point, both of the data that would be generated and the implementation. I wanted to see if I could programatically search for trending topics within the subreddit community, specifically characters and shows. The first step to this end was to build a cron job that would collect all new data on a periodic basis. Then, the title would be parsed against other titles to find the longest, most common phrase. In the end, I spun this off into a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/ai-tan">bot that posts statistical analyses</a> of various things happening in the subreddt. Additionally, it also directly kicked off a project at work programatically associating <a href="http://www.newson6.com/story/19992537/broken-arrow-police-make-arrest-in-fatal-hit-and-run-of-a-pedestrian">similar stories to each other</a>.[break]</p>
<h2 id="project-3-image-similarity-analysis">Project 3 - Image Similarity Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Code</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/awwnimePostFinder">GitHub</a>
Even back in the digg days (when they were called dupes), reposts were an issue. On a subreddit as small as r/awwnime, it&#39;s even more painfully apparent. Seeing that I already had the cron collecting all images blowing through, tacking on a little bit of image analysis was fairly easy. The analyzing itself is fairly simple and rudimentary; each individual pixel is broken down into twelve &quot;buckets&quot;: red, green, and blue with four slots for value. These values or normalized over the entire image and dumped into a database. From there, it&#39;s simple arithmetic to calculate whether an image is similar or not. The final result can be found <a href="http://awwni.me/repost">here</a>. The percentage is hardly accurate and I&#39;m not sure what to do about that, but it only shows 100% for images that are insanely close, so there&#39;s that. Interestingly enough, bits of the front end for this project have found their way into another work project (not yet live).</p>
<h2 id="project-4-bracket">Project 4 - Bracket</h2>
<p><a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/">The Great 2012 Awwnime Bracket</a>
This project was entirely to kick up some fun within the community and less for the programming challenge (although, that did rear its head). Every year in Japan, there&#39;s a thing called the <a href="http://www.animesaimoe.org/">Saimoe Tournament</a> wherein people will vote for their favorite characters from the previous year of shows. I wanted to bring that to r/awwnime, so I did. Figuring out how the stupid thing would actually work required some thinking, and running it has been both gratifying and tedious. In the end, I settled on a nomination round, an elimination round, and now we&#39;ve moved on to the bracket proper. There were over 800 nominations to sift through and as of now, over 50000 votes have been cast. Keeping cheating and gaming of the system to a minimum required a little engineering, but the real programming challenge was generating the <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/bracket_full.jpg">bracket images</a>. Lots of math. I sometimes suck at that. I did have fun designing the look and interface of this one, though. I don&#39;t do that too often.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what this little community will inspire me to do next, but it&#39;s given me half a year of nice little brain challenges and nice pictures.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the most difficult day yet. It was a dreadfully slow day at work which left me wanting to surf the old stand bys (reddit, youtube, facebook, etc.) Instead, I spent time combing the news sites, reading articles, and contemplating performance improvements.</p>
<p>At home, things aren&#39;t so bad. I can nap or read or whatever. I&#39;ve nearly finished all of my Toradora manga, leaving Oreimo and Yotsuba on my high priority pile.</p>

<p>Finished both the Hobbit and Madoka 2 tonight. This was probably my most enjoyable read of the Hobbit, knowing the story of LotR and also just being old enough to understand it all. Still, I found Tolkien&#39;s prose to be a highly annoying in places. His odd phrasings and lack of correct comma usage made some bits difficult to read. But even so, enjoyable nontheless.</p>

[quote]So, I skipped writing anything yesterday. Slept right through it, I did. An interesting thing to note about how my sleep habits have changed: they&#39;re actually getting worse. The last two nights I&#39;ve woken in in the middle of sleeping for no apparent reason. Usually, this only happens when I&#39;m under great stress. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself stressed right now; annoyed, but not stressed.</p>
<p>In terms of reading, I am now half way through three books: The Hobbit, Oreimo, and Madoka 2. Jeff and I also rediscovered the joy of Stratego this evening even though it ended in stalemate. Four days...[/quote]</p>

[quote]It&#39;s been nearly twenty-four hours since I last surfed the social web. Despite the cravings I&#39;ve had to see how my karma seeds are growing, I haven&#39;t found it too difficult to not turn the computer on. At work, I kept myself busy with actual work and these math/programming challenges Mickael dug up. At home, I did wind up watching HIMYM because I didn&#39;t feel like torrenting it next week. But since, I&#39;ve kept myself busy with a walk to Wal-mart, making and consuming pumpkin bread, and gratuitous reading. Now, I am drawing myself a batch and will probably read and then turn in.</p>

<p>It has been about forty minutes since I shut down my computer. Fairly typical for a work evening, but what is not typical are all the thoughts of stuff I&#39;ll be missing, How I Met Your Mother, for instance. Also, writing in a straight line is hard. I suppose my plan of action at this point is to read something and then go to bed. I will sorely miss my asmr videos to be sure... Only seven days left...[/quote]</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Unjacking from the Matrix - An Experiment</h2><time>September 30, 2012</time><div><p>The internet these days is ubiquitous; you can hardly go anywhere without encountering it. Of course, having internet enabled phones means we can take the &#39;net with you wherever you go. You can&#39;t escape the thing, it seems. This goes doubly so for me since my sole source of income hinges on this internet existing. But, in the name of science, I am going to eschew all that for an entire week (insofar as I am able).</p>
<p>Starting at midnight tonight (central daylight time), I will forgo all operations that require the use of the internet with two exceptions: usage at work for work related things, and one particular Skype phone call/gaming session that has already been arranged. Added to that, my computer and various other electronic gadgets at home will remain turned off for the entirety of this experiment. This list includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>TV and any attached device</li>
<li>PlayBook</li>
<li>DS/3DS</li>
<li>PSP</li>
</ul>
<p>I will allow myself the use of my record player for any musical needs I require. Additionally, I will keep my phone turned on for outside contact purposes, but nothing more (essentially what I do now anyways).</p>
<p>Without any of these devices, I shall be forced to more archaic forms of entertainment to keep myself occupied. Like getting started on that pile of books I&#39;ve purchased over the last year but still have not read...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/book_pile.jpg" alt="" title="Ordered in terms of priority, with the exception of some inconsistencies on the numbered books..."></p>
<p>Additional things I&#39;ve considered for my entertainment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a written journal of my time off the grid (which, of course, will be posted here)</li>
<li>Drawing</li>
<li>Biking</li>
<li>Making my own set of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IlHjMa74UE">chain mail</a></li>
<li>Cleaning up my room...</li>
<li>Napping... a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I&#39;d like to say good-bye to reddit, Facebook, twitter, Google Reader, and all my various home programming projects. In case I die from this self-inflicted technological black out, it&#39;s been a good run.</p>
<p>See you guys on the other side...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember how we got there, but in one of my previous conversations with a certain Mr. Helton, he mentioned something about writing a Wedge/Tycho slashfic. Whether it was a challenge or not, I don&#39;t know, but I accepted it anyways. Here are the fruits of my labors.</p>
<p>A note to my mother - Just don&#39;t read this. It&#39;s all satire, but it would make dinners awkward, I&#39;m sure.[break]</p>
<h2 id="-quote-personae-dramatis">[quote]Personae Dramatis</h2>
<p>Commander Wedge Antilles, Human male
Captain Tycho Celchu, Human male
Admiral Gial Ackbar, Mon Calamari male</p>
<hr>
<p>The sun had set over the city planet of Coruscant, but the lights of ever present aerial traffic shone through Tycho Celchu&#39;s window. He was poring over plans and documents for an upcoming mission. Despite the successful takeover of the now home of the New Republic, Rogue Squadron was as busy as ever keeping the Imperial Remnant at bay.</p>
<p>Just about ready to turn in for the night, the door chime of Tycho&#39;s modest apartment sounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Who could that be at this hour?&quot; he muttered.</p>
<p>Lifting himself out of his bunk, Tycho pressed the button on the access plate and the door slid open. Standing there in front of him was his commanding officer, Wedge Antilles.</p>
<p>&quot;Good evening, boss. What brings you around this late?&quot; Tycho motioned Wedge into his quarters.</p>
<p>Wedge entered and scratched at his hair, which was slightly unkempt. &quot;Couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pre-mission jitters? That&#39;s unlike you,&quot; Tycho said as he headed towards the kitchen. &quot;Caf?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, please.&quot; Wedge sat himself in a chair in the living area.</p>
<p>Tycho returned with two hot cups of caf and handed one to Wedge.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not the mission, Tycho. I&#39;ve helped destroy two Death Stars and take over the Imperial&#39;s central strong hold. War doesn&#39;t really phase me anymore,&quot; said Wedge as he sipped at his cup.</p>
<p>Tycho raised an eyebrow. &quot;What could possibly have the great Wedge Antilles bothered out of a good night&#39;s sleep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Love,&quot; responded Wedge shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha. It wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with that Qwi Xux, would it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re a few books too early for that reference, Tycho.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shit, you&#39;re right. Regardless, you&#39;ve come to the wrong guy. I&#39;m not getting as much action out of Winter as I&#39;d like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Tycho. You&#39;re the only one who can help me with this problem.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you, Tycho...&quot;</p>
<p>Tycho sat in his chair, staring in the direction of his commanding officer and best friend. He was certain that his ears were playing tricks on him or perhaps that he had returned to the brain washing facility at Lusankya.</p>
<p>&quot;C-come again?&quot; Tycho stammered in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I COME NOW!&quot; Wedge screamed as he stood from his chair and ripped off all his clothes. His lightsaber was ignited and at the ready.</p>
<p>&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; exclaimed Tycho, rolling out of his own chair and leaping some distance back.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck is exactly right, Captain. My S-Foil is locked in the attack position. I must fire it and you&#39;re the target!&quot; Wedge had a crazy gleam in his eye.</p>
<p>Tycho was crouched at the far end of the room wondering how their conversation had escalated so quickly to this, really at how it had gotten to this at all. But as he stared at Wedge and the magnificent blaster he was brandishing, Tycho began to realize that he too had wanted this. He knew that he&#39;d always had a close friendship with Wedge, but it always felt different from the other friendships he had formed over his life. The connection he had with Wedge was something more and it took Wedge&#39;s tremendous clothes shredding strength for Tycho to realize it.</p>
<p>Slowly, Tycho began to rise from his crouching position. He made his way over to the chiseled nakedness of Wedge&#39;s form, stripping his own clothes as he walked across the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Wedge... I didn&#39;t realize it until now, but...&quot; Tycho leaned in towards Wedge&#39;s ear and whispered, &quot;I love you too.&quot;</p>
<p>Tycho grabbed the hilt of Wedge&#39;s lightsaber and began stroking it as Wedge kissed the nape of Tycho&#39;s neck. Suddenly, the door opend and in walked Admiral Ackbar.</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#39;t withstand firepower of this magnitude,&quot; said the fish-like Mon Calamari, who&#39;s own member was quite clearly in attack formation.</p>
<p>Tycho and Wedge let go of their embrace and crawled over towards the Admiral so that his blaster canon was twitching in their faces.</p>
<p>&quot;It smells like fish,&quot; said Wedge as he gave it a furtive glance.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s see if it tastes like fish,&quot; responded Tycho.</p>
<p>Tycho took the business end of the Admiral&#39;s gun into his mouth and...</p>
<p>Okay, FUCK this shit. I can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not my style. Let&#39;s back up a few paragraphs.</p>
<p>There was a chime at the door. Tycho got up and opened it; there stood Wedge. &quot;Hey, man. Let&#39;s get some beers,&quot; said Wedge. &quot;Alright, Commander&quot;. Tycho and Wedge got super drunk at a bar. The next day in an explosion of testosterone, they kicked the Imperials asses and immediately after fucked a hundred bitches each.</p>
<p>THE END[/quote]</p>

There are some selfish reasons, I&#39;ll admit, like winning the company Christmas decorations contest. But, I digress.</p>
<p>To that end, I horked some code from a Taiko no Tatsujin clone I&#39;d been writing a few years ago and tossed the output at the Arduino via serial data. Here&#39;s the result:</p>

Perhaps it&#39;d be more challenging to actually create new content for an entire month, but I&#39;m too lazy for that.</p>
<p>Instead, you get random scraps of things I started and never completed from my sketch books. So, yeah. Enjoy that. Or have a beer. Or have a beer and then enjoy that.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_burning_fairy.jpg" alt="" title="Not so sweet anymore">
This was the first thing I drew with the complimentary box of Crayons I got from Crayola. I was not in the least bit bitter.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_godcoon.jpg" alt="" title="Make her an offer she can&#39;t refuse, Nook">
I had an idea for a Animal Crossing/Godfather crossover comic. This is all that was ever really drawn.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_hanako_school.jpg" alt="" title="Complete with random wind">
Sketch of my Hanako character. This isn&#39;t terrible, so I&#39;m not sure why I never finished it.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/art_hanako_sundress.jpg" alt="" title="SUNDRESSES!">
Hanako in various different poses and styles. Also, I have a penchant for sundresses.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make up for the day I missed.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Relaunch Yet Again</h2><time>July 28, 2012</time><div><p>Oops, I did it again. I have redesigned and relaunched this website. Granted, I managed to go nearly two years without touching it. That&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s new? Outside of an enormous code reworking to take into account the wonderful new OOP changes in PHP 5.3 and the obvious new look, here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive design: not everything has this treatment (art page), but all the main pages should display themselves nicely no matter what device you view them on.</li>
<li>Threaded comments: if you reply to a message, your reply will display underneath, <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/useless-justification/#comments">like this</a>.</li>
<li>Removal of SSO for comments: no more twitter, no more facebook. Gravatar is also used for avatars.</li>
<li>Better lightbox: every image in a blog post will display in a lightbox when clicked (larger if there happens to be a larger image). This same lightbox is also used for the art page</li>
<li>Art page is all pintresty. Because, hey, why not.</li>
<li>Content reorganization: gone is the video tab, here is the &quot;code&quot; tab with all sorts of random code projects of mine.</li>
<li>Popular art module. That&#39;s new.</li>
<li>Cloud tag has been removed.</li>
<li>Archives is a list again and smarter in that it will select what year to show depending on the context of the page you&#39;re on.</li>
<li>Code snippets use the Solarized theme</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#39;s what&#39;s new on the front end. As stated, most of the fun stuff is all in the code changes. And, for the first time ever, you can see the code that&#39;s running this site on its <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/DxCMS">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Useless Justification</h2><time>July 27, 2012</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/the_bed.jpg" alt="" title="My dojo of solitude"></p>
<p>One of the things that seems to come up with some frequency at work is the size of my bed. I don&#39;t know how or why, but there it is.</p>
<p>Anyways, I sleep in a twin bed and one of my coworkers can&#39;t quite comprehend how I can sleep in a bed so small. My general response is it takes up less space and I&#39;m the only one sleeping in it (also, it&#39;s <em>fucking comfortable</em>). I also have a reverse claustrophobia when it comes to beds: the larger they are, the more uncomfortable I am. But, today as I was lying comfortable in said bed, I realized that there is a more objective way to prove my twin bed is more awesome than all other beds: it&#39;s widescreen.</p>
<p>We all know that widescreen is the preferred video format of choice these days as it closer matches the aspect ratio of our own vision; we can see a wider field of view than we can in height. Here&#39;s some aspect ratios of common video formats:</p>
<p>Anamorphic widescreen (film) - 2.39:1
HDTV, aka 16:9 - 1.78:1
SDTV, aka 4:3 - 1.33:1</p>
<p>These are width to height ratios, so let&#39;s take that and apply them to standard bed sizes:</p>
<p>Twin - 1.92:1
Full - 1.38:1
Queen - 1.33:1</p>
<p>As you can see, twin falls right in between film and HDTV, which is a particularly awesome place to be. However, the larger beds are all standard definition (with queen size being right on the money). We all know how much standard definition sucks.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ll be on my modern day standards sized bed.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s a Process - 2010 Site Design</h2><time>July 26, 2012</time><div><p>I was digging through my old sketch books looking for shitty drawings to post (they will be coming) when I ran across my initial design sketches for this site&#39;s current design. Seeing as I plan on rolling out the <em>new</em> site within the next few days, I thought it&#39;d be more timely to post those instead.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_layout.jpg" alt="" title="Basic layout">
An overview of the basic site layout. As you can see, there&#39;s not much difference between this sketch and the final product. Somewhere along the line the &quot;about me&quot; box was lost, but the rest is nigh spot on.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_gallery.jpg" alt="" title="Gallery">
This doesn&#39;t have any accompanying notes, but I assume that it must be a concept for the gallery pages (they&#39;re the only ones with the square grid).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_article.jpg" alt="" title="Article">
A more detailed version of a blog entry. The social media icons were eventually dropped and the comments counter moved to the bottom. Couldn&#39;t rip <em>everything</em> off of Joystiq...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_header.jpg" alt="" title="JELLYFISH SHIRT!">
I fought for the longest time with what the site header should be. I&#39;m wondering why I dropped the caricature of myself sporting my signature jellyfish t-shirt.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/site2010_theme.jpg" alt="" title="Underwater is my thing">
An idea for a full site theme. Post launch I added the circles to try and curb the gratuitous white space.</p>
<p>Arguably, my designs don&#39;t go through a whole lot of iteration on paper; they spend most of their time being refined in my head and again in code. This is not the best way to approach design, but designer is a title I&#39;m trying to leave behind, so I suppose it&#39;s okay.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Weekend Swag</h2><time>July 25, 2012</time><div><p>As promised, here are pictures of the swag I purchased over the weekend.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag1.jpg" alt="" title="Randomness">
These are the contents of two grab bags I picked up. Nothing terribly interesting, I suppose. And the j-rap CD is just as bad as the cover might lead one to think.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag2.jpg" alt="" title="Katanashi is having a bad day">
This show is pretty hilarious and not very popular (that I know of), so I was surprised to see this at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt2012_swag3.jpg" alt="" title="Hmm..">
And this is the purchase that has me seriously questioning my life. As I was unfurling it, I began to realize that I had just doomed myself to a life of perpetual virginity. Either that or I&#39;m going to have to find a very forgiving girlfriend.</p>
<p>Very, very forgiving.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>And now for some rest</h2><time>July 24, 2012</time><div><p>Continuing (and ending) my crazy weekend blitz, my dad and two oldest brothers went on a trek to Six Flags in Dallas. I and a band of coworkers had ventured out in May and I enjoyed myself enough to vow to go again (soon). A few days later while I was Skyping family, my dad was waxing nostalgic about his times at Six Flags. I decided that was reason enough to gather everybody up for a grande trip.</p>
<p>While there, I took about 438 photos (mostly quick sequential images), but here&#39;s the best of the bunch:</p>
<p>Our first stop of the day was the &quot;Conquistador&quot;. Not terribly fun, in my opinion, but okay.
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_conquistador.jpg" alt="" title="It doesn&#39;t go any higher than this">[break]</p>
<p>I forget the name of the second ride we went on, but it was snake themed. It was both the first and last roller coaster we rode.
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_dad_jeff.jpg" alt="" title="Kind of bob sleddy"></p>
<p>Right across the way was a teacup ride. It was highly similar to a Kiddie Park ride that we used to go on all the time wherein the thing spins around but your individual pod is also spun around... by you... as fast as you please... It&#39;s a kid&#39;s ride, but we got on for nostalgia reasons.
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_teacups.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s made for kids, so I&#39;m sure we looked odd riding it..."></p>
<p>The next ride of the day was the Superman, which takes you 245 feet into the air and drops you.
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_superman1.jpg" alt="" title="First you go up...">
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_superman2.jpg" alt="" title="...then down..">
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_superman3.jpg" alt="" title="...then you grin like an idiot."></p>
<p>The second rollar coaster of the day (which was also ridden twice) was the Texas Giant. Sadly, there are no photos of us on it, but it&#39;s a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_texas_giant2.jpg" alt="" title="This is the part where everybody screams"></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_texas_giant3.jpg" alt="" title="There are many banking turns"></p>
<p>Also ridden twice was my personal favorite coaster, the Titan. This is a beast of a ride that does it&#39;s best to crush you to a pulp using nothing but the power of momentum. This was also ridden twice.
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_titan.jpg" alt="" title="Majestic..."></p>
<p>I believe there was a lame log ride in between, but the next stop was the Batman, by far the most twisty yet also the most comfortable ride in the park.
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_batman1.jpg" alt="" title="Much steel to be seen"></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_batman2.jpg" alt="" title="You honestly don&#39;t even feel it"></p>
<p>Of course, you can&#39;t stand around in the Texas heat without getting on a serious water ride.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_presplash.jpg" alt="" title="Wait for it..."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_splash.jpg" alt="" title="And now you&#39;re soaked"></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_soaked.jpg" alt="" title="You don&#39;t come out dry"></p>
<p>Despite being one of the last things we went on, we were dry by the time we left. And when we got to the hotel we were staying at, this was the view outside our door:
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sixflags2012_hotel_view.jpg" alt="" title="A glittering site"></p>
<p>The yelling that Chris and I did at each other about directions notwithstanding, it was a pretty awesome day.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&#39;s a picture of a bunch of Hello Kitty&#39;s because my dad told me too.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Tokyo in Tulsa 2012 - Final Day</h2><time>July 22, 2012</time><div><p>Another convention has come and gone, again with me feeling that I&#39;m just too old and too male for these kind of outings (and possibly the content around which it focuses). But that&#39;s a musing for a future post.</p>
<p>Today we intended to keep things short by just attending the autograph tables. My brother (whom you shall see shortly) was in the longest line of the bunch, along with what were surely a bunch of yaoi fangirls. If you don&#39;t know what yaoi is, I&#39;m not going to be the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/04/11/">one to teach you</a>. While he was in the line, I decided to be an ass and get autographs from all of the other voice actors in the room, all the while casting him assholish faces.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll do a write up about the whole experience and the psychological state it&#39;s left me in later in the week, but for now, here&#39;s some pictures.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>100% Filler</h2><time>July 19, 2012</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/international_travel.jpg" alt="" title="You&#39;re already hearing the theme in your head..."></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be glad when tomorrow rolls around and I can just do a picture dump of cosplayers from the convention...</p>
<p>But, today, I don&#39;t have that luxury, so I&#39;ll just ramble a bit.</p>
<p>International travel is something that hasn&#39;t ever intrigued me much, save for two destinations. The first is a rather obvious trip to Japan. It&#39;s impossible to say that the Oriental archipelago hasn&#39;t affected my life and attitude in some way, so a trip there to see the source of it all is certainly in order. My two oldest brothers and myself are planning on fulfilling this order sometime next year.</p>
<p>The second place that I&#39;d love to visit you probably wouldn&#39;t guess... unless you&#39;re one of the people whom I&#39;ve told and subsequently think that I&#39;m crazy for even thinking this. That place would be Prypiat, Ukraine - the city inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.</p>
<p>I cannot explain why I find the whole story around the Chernobyl disaster so intriguing. Part of it is because I find nuclear power in itself utterly fascinating. I recall when the Great East Japan Earthquake broke out last year and Fukushima Daiichi began its series of cascading failures, I religiously checked the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">IAEA</a> website for new information several times a day hungry for more information on what was happening. I did that for a solid two months, hanging on to every word mentioned about the core temperatures, water levels, radiation spread, and so forth. Maybe I just have an interest in nuclear disaster...</p>
<p>But, I digress.</p>
<p>Yes, the Chernobyl disaster is something that I&#39;ve been interested in for a very long time. I remember reading again and again a National Geographic article on it when I was around 11 or 12. They had aerial pictures of the core shortly after the explosion, pictures of reactor 4 before the sarcophagus went up, cut away diagrams of the melted reactor material oozing into the basement. It&#39;s amazingly fascinating stuff. So, when a fellow redditor posted <a href="http://imgur.com/a/trm7p">images of his tour</a>, all those feelings of intrigue were dredged up again. Plus, Prypiat is now <a href="http://tour2chernobyl.com/">open for tours</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, this is a tour of the ghost town outside of the plant rather than a tour of the plant itself (which I would prefer and then get cancer for having done), but that in and of itself would be pretty awesome, if not entirely creepy. Perhaps I can realize this dream in 2014 or beyond.</p>
<p>Unless I have a girlfriend or something...</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Random Movie Night #1 - Seven Years in Tibet</h2><time>July 16, 2012</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tibet.jpg" alt="" title="Seven Years in Tibet"></p>
<p>Beginning my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/solving-inane-issues-with-programming">Russian Roulette of movies</a> is <em>Seven Years in Tibet</em>. Though the name sounded highly familiar (for reasons I wouldn&#39;t realize until later), I knew pretty much nothing of this movie going in. I knew so little, in fact, that I was quite surprised to see Brad Pitt&#39;s face on the case as I removed it from the DVD shelf. With a name like that, I&#39;d have assumed it&#39;d be a movie from the late 50s early 60s. This may be untrue of the film, but not of the source material. However, a quick synopsis before I leap into my thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Seven Years in Tibet</em> follows the exploits of a certain Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber, during the late 30s into the early 50s. After a failed mountain climbing expedition, he is detained by British soldiers (war was breaking out). He and another of his mountain climbing brigade escape captivity and stumble their way into Tibet. There, Harrer begins a new life in this foreign land and even winds up befriending the young Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The first thing I must say about this film is how much it reminds me of <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>, both in narrative and cinematography (which I will get to shortly). Both films are set about the same time period and follow a protagonist - who also happens to be based upon a real person - that has found himself in a foreign land which they enjoy immensely. I think that <em>Tibet</em> succeeds a little more than <em>Lawrence</em> in that it does a really good job in fleshing out the characters and, particularly, their relationships with each other, whereas <em>Lawrence</em> seems more focused on the titular character.</p>
<p>The performances from the actors are also very good, especially the kid they got to play the Dalai Lama. He plays Mr. Lama with all the grace that one would expect of the role, but also with a wide eyed curiosity as he questions Harrer about the world outside the monastery. Brad Pitt also plays his role well, going from arrogant ego-head in the beginning to a genuinely likable character at the end. His Austrian accent isn&#39;t the greatest, but I&#39;ve heard worse. David Thewlis, who played Harrer&#39;s mountaineering companion Peter Aufschnaiter, was pretty awesome throughout the entire film, bringing an English attitude with an Austrian accent.</p>
<p>The cinematography for this <em>Tibet</em> is fantastic, capturing well the locales and feel of the time. I said before that the movie sounded like something from the mid-1900s, and it really does feel like it (sans all the weird fades that plague old movies). Being that there&#39;s much travelling taking place, there are a lot of wide shots of the outdoors and they all look phenomenal - probably because they actually shot outdoors as opposed to the cold, digital look of a green screen. As mentioned earlier, <em>Tibet</em> feels much like <em>Lawrence</em> in its visuals and I think it is because so much of the outdoors are shown with all the exotic villages interspersed between.</p>
<p>Finally, I must make mention of the music. I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the opening credits so I missed the composer, but somewhere towards the middle of the film I offhandedly commented that it sounded very John Williams-esque. As it turns out I was correct and not necessarily because I can pick a John Williams piece from a mile off. I pondered on the music a little more and realized that the theme from the movie was part of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-Williams-Greatest-Hits-1969/dp/B00002MZ4V">John Williams - Greatest Hits</a> album (which answered where I&#39;d heard the movie title). Interestingly, there was a scratch on the disc where this song was so it would forever loop the last minute or so.</p>
<p>On an additional note, I believe that the Tibetan culture is the base for the Airbenders in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbender">Avatar</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I quite enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure for the eyes and very well executed. There is a bit of a political agenda for the film, but such is to be expected when in real life China comes barging in and taking over the place. This, however, did not taint my enjoyment of the movie. I highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys film in any fashion(chances are you probably already have).</p>
<p>Tomorrow, (or rather, tonight by the time you read this), we take another journey to exotic lands...</p>
<p>A 45-minute guided tour of the interior of the NCC-1701...</p>
<p>Oh, and the rest of the movie that goes with it.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Solving Inane Issues with Programming</h2><time>July 15, 2012</time><div><p>I&#39;m slowly running out of things to say for the remainder of the month and the most interesting stuff is still five days out. Also, my brother and I have run out of things to watch, having finished seven seasons of How I Met Your Mother and rewatched both seasons of Higurashi in about a couple months. We&#39;re about to start watching Clannad again, but there&#39;s actually a simple solution to both of these problems.</p>
<p>And that solution is programming.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned before, but about half a mile up from work is a branch of the local library. They have a pretty decent collection of Blu-rays. So, I wrote a <a href="http://pastebin.com/1H0gZ6XY">small script</a> to scrape all the <a href="http://pastebin.com/ix4Px68c">blu-ray titles</a> at that location and, at random, pick four movies for us to watch. Here&#39;s what it came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seven Years in Tibet </li>
<li>Star Trek - The Motion Picture</li>
<li>The Silence of the Lambs </li>
<li>9</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 4 was originally <em>Superman Returns</em>, but my brother and I have already seen that and so decided to reroll.</p>
<p>I suppose out of a data set of only 460+ there was bound to be one movie I&#39;d recognize, but not all four.</p>
<p>So, each day on my lunch break, I will bravely trek up to the library to fetch one of these discs. If one shouldn&#39;t be available, I&#39;ll move to the next item on the list. If I go past the end, a new movie will be randomly selected. This movie will then be watched and I will give a short review of my feelings at the end.</p>
<p>Seriously, being a programmer is akin to being a wizard in the Harry Potter world. I don&#39;t know how you muggles make it...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Eventualities</h2><time>July 14, 2012</time><div><p>A while back, shortly before my leaving Griffin, my French coworker brought a bunch of stuff that was eating up space in his house and pawned it off to the rest of us. There was no exchange of money, but many <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/lunch/">lunch battles</a> were had.</p>
<p>One of the items was a <a href="http://www.jbox.com/product/KING132">Japanese microwave potato chip maker</a>. He&#39;d never used it himself, so passed it on to me to be the brave one to try such odd novelties. I accepted his challenge to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>And then it sat in my closet for over a year.</p>
<p>That is, until today when, in a fit of super boredom, I decided that giving this thing a shot would be a good way to kill some minutes and also satiate my rumbling stomach (didn&#39;t work, wound up at Taco Bell anyways).[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/microwave_chips1.jpg" alt="" title="Slice..."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/microwave_chips2.jpg" alt="" title="...arrange..."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/microwave_chips3.jpg" alt="" title="...burn!"></p>
<p>The setup is pretty easy: peel potato, slice in the slicer, arrange in the holder, nuke for around five minutes. What came out was actually pretty good. They&#39;re kind of like a cross between normal chips and potato wedges, crispy on the outside with a little bit of give inside.</p>
<p>I may actually use this thing again and experiment with seasonings. Also, hopefully I&#39;ll have larger potatoes next time.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>After Last Night&#x27;s Escapades...</h2><time>July 14, 2012</time><div><p>I got shit faced after making last night&#39;s comic. Then I threw up. Immediately afterwards,I wrote this on the board.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sobriety.jpg" alt="" title="Never again"></p>
<p>It&#39;s okay, though. My brother already had a bowl standing by and my aim was true.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Whiteboard</h2><time>July 12, 2012</time><div><p>Above my second monitor and slightly to the right is my brain&#39;s physical scratch disk, aka my whiteboard. It&#39;s there for ideas I don&#39;t want to forget or for figuring stuff out.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/whiteboard.jpg" alt="" title="Fairly white, yet">[break]</p>
<p>While the whiteboard itself is something I purchased since moving, some of the items have been transferred from whiteboards past, carrying forward all the way since college. In fact, you can see some of these items from my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/alright-here-you-go">apartment walkthrough video</a> from last year. Here&#39;s a quick rundown of what&#39;s going on:</p>
<p><strong>Omnisexual</strong> - This was an off the cuff comment my brother made about his sexuality. It was funny and I had a comic idea for it, but I&#39;ve since forgot how that goes...</p>
<p><strong>&quot;A Rare Vintage&quot;</strong> - The title of a blog post as suggested by devusb. It was to contain more <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/have-you-ever-hated-yourself/">YPN forum posts</a> by yours truly from a batch of newer posts I&#39;d unearthed.</p>
<p><strong>Custard&#39;s Revenge</strong> - A flash game idea proposed devusb. I would explain the details, but my mother reads this blog. I will say this: it involves General Custer and a pie.</p>
<p><strong>Smoking the Town - The Wisp, Teleporting bus</strong> - these are both comic ideas and are also the oldest items on the board. The ideas date back to 2008 as I thought of them while playing Animal Crossing.</p>
<p><strong>Falcon Fruit Punch, PHI Love Hina, Zelda/Monsters Inc, Weekend of Ponies</strong> - All comic ideas that I will get around to one of these days. The PHI one is actually based upon an experience I had in one of my psychology classes, but is one of the more recent adds to the board.</p>
<p><strong>Cortosis shoulder pads</strong> - Another devusb inspired comic idea. This one is actually pretty damned hilarious if not entirely nerdy.</p>
<p><strong>Iku (kanji)</strong> - one of my lame attempts to teach myself Japanese, this is the word for &quot;go&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Mahou Shounen Mahiro Magica</strong> - An animation idea parodying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoka_Magica">Madoka Magica</a>, except about a flamboyantly gay man who is turned into a magical girl.</p>
<p><strong>Sat - Space Bros</strong> - What&#39;s left of my spring season anime simulcast schedule. <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers">Space Brothers</a>, the only thing still running from that season, is a great little show about some dude trying to become an astronaut. It&#39;s not really very Japanesey at all and is quite well-researched in its facts.</p>
<p><strong>Doodles</strong> - This was me trying to visualize the camera and casting of rays in a ray caster.</p>
<p>And so, that&#39;s what is going on with my whiteboard. Someday, I&#39;ll have actually completed all these items and then maybe I can erase the damn thing.</p>
<p>Ah, who am I kidding.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll probably die first.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Writing Super Tiny Code</h2><time>July 11, 2012</time><div><p>About a month or so ago, there was a contest thread on reddit whose objective was to write a PHP function to score a bowling game in as few characters as possible. A comma delimited string of frames would be passed in to the function and the score of said string would be returned.</p>
<p>My first step to this was to write, in normal code, a function that would do just that:</p>
<p>[code=php]function dxprog($game) {
    $game = explode(&#39;,&#39;, $game);
    $len = count($game);
    $i = 0;
    $score = 0;
    $frame = 0;
    while ($frame &lt; 10) {
        $frame++;
        $score += $game[$i];
        $next = $i + 1 &lt; $len ? $game[$i + 1] : 0;
        $next2 = $i + 2 &lt; $len ? $game[$i + 2] : 0;
        if ($game[$i] == 10) {
            $score += $next + $next2;
            $i++;
        } else if ($game[$i] &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; $game[$i] + $next == 10) {
            $score += $next;
            $score += $next2;
            $i += 2;
        } else {
            $score += $next;
            $i += 2;
        }
    }
    return $score;
}[/code]</p>
<p>496 characters. Obviously, the next step was to minify that code:</p>
<p>[code=php]function dxprog($game) {
    $g=split(&#39;,&#39;,$game);$l=count($g);$i=$s=$f=0;while($f&lt;10){$f++;$s+=$g[$i];$n=$i+1&lt;$l?$g[$i+1]:0;$n2=$i+2&lt;$l?$g[$i+2]:0;if($g[$i]==10){$s+=$n+$n2;$i++;}else if($g[$i]&lt;10&amp;&amp;$g[$i]+$n==10){$s+=$n+$n2;$i+=2;}else{$s+=$n;$i+=2;}}return $s;
}[/code]</p>
<p>That brings us down to 232 characters. All of the minification was done by hand and now began the task of trimming as many characters as I could. Any reduction in characters, no matter how few, was welcomed. I reviewed my logic, rolled together declarations where I could and came up with the following 186 characters:</p>
<p>[code=php]function dxprog($game) {
    $g=split(&#39;,&#39;,$game);$l=count($g);$i=$s=$f=0;while($f&lt;10){$f++;$s+=$x=$g[$i];$o=$i+2&lt;$l?$g[$i+2]:0;$n=++$i&lt;$l?$g[$i]:0;if($x==10)$s+=$n+$o;else{$s+=$n;$i++;$s+=$x+$n==10?$o:0;}}return $s;
}[/code]</p>
<p>This challenge was pretty interesting because it required me to think in ways I never have before. In PHP, there&#39;s little reason to write small code, and in JavaScript, I&#39;ll just run it all through something like <a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home">Closure Compiler</a>, so this was something entirely new. What really helped reduce the code in the end was eliminating conditional branches that did the same thing (ternaries also helped immensely).</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Lunch Musings - November 11, 2011</h2><time>July 9, 2012</time><div><p>I was walking on my lunch break as I oft do and I saw sign with &quot;11-1-11&quot; scribbled on the back. This reminded me of the big stink that nerds raised last year on 11-11-11 and how it was the &quot;last binary date of our generation&quot;.</p>
<p>But, nerds. You should know this wasn&#39;t true.</p>
<p>Yes, 111111 is 63 and, no, we&#39;re never going to encounter a date like that again in our lifetimes or in the next thousand years, for that matter. But for any nerd to try and assume that 11-11-11 is a valid date is stupid. There was this little thing a few years ago called Y2K.</p>
<p>You may recall it.</p>
<p>The whole issue with Y2K, for those who don&#39;t recall or never knew, was in the data depiction of years in a date. The first two digits were discarded and only the last two saved. Computers automatically stuffed a &quot;19&quot; in front and called it a day. Obviously, when those two stored digits were &quot;00&quot;, all the dates would read 1900 and there would be mass pandemonium.</p>
<p>But, since the crossing of the (almost) new millennium, we&#39;ve had to differentiate by storing the entire date, meaning all years would be stored/displayed as a four digit number.</p>
<p>So, in nerd terms, there never <em>was</em> a 11-11-11, just 11-11-2011 (or, 20111111 if you like being able to sort your dates numerically). And now that we can store dates ranging from 1/1/0001 to 12/31/9999, there was no excuse for the &quot;whooaaahh&quot; moment.</p>
<p>Now, January 19, 2038 03:14:08? <em>That&#39;s</em> something to look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">forward to</a>.</p>

<p>That photo series is scant on details, but there&#39;s really no recipe to follow here. I used the recipe on the back of a package of pizza yeast, stuffed into muffin tins, and filled with deliciousness - pizza sauce, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, and mozzarella (the stuff you find in the hispanic section, not shredded).

<p>As it turns out, FedEx delivers Tuesday through Saturday, so my lost weekend is less so.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been wanting a decent camera for some time as the point and shoots do not deliver the kind of quality I would prefer (and tend to fall apart rather quickly). I was actually planning on picking up a dSLR last year before the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/from-the-con-floor-day-1/">anime convention</a>, but, I couldn&#39;t find one for a decent enough price that also did video. The answer to that problem, apparently, is to simply wait a year.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now - still wanting a good camera for the con - and the camera I&#39;ve purchased, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J3V90Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p421_d6_g421_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=19H1SBQ8D7AXT6FGWZCS&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938811&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Canon Rebel T3i</a> retails for $750, well under the lower end numbers from last year. Toss in some clever shopping about and selling off of soon-to-be deprecated hardware (my old camcorder), and that $750 is brought down to a much more tolerable $350.</p>
<p>Even at $750, it would have been worth every goddamn penny. The picture above was taken with the flash <em>off</em> in my poorly lit bathroom. AND IT STILL LOOKS AMAZING (my troll face notwithstanding)!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not yet played around with the video option much, but expect some new movies this month now with fancy, movie style <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzC0Ek6X5FY">rack focus</a>!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Stories from the Crypt</h2><time>July 6, 2012</time><div><p>That thing that was supposed to come through today didn&#39;t which means I am left to my own devices all weekend. So, tonight I&#39;ll just repost this comment I left on reddit some days ago (because that&#39;s what we do):</p>
<p>My moronic roommate had invited some person from his class to stay at our place. I already hated my roommate, but I was in my last few months of college and it meant paying less, so I agreed to it.
Few days later, he&#39;s helping move the new guy&#39;s stuff in when he waddles into my room (overweight) all red in the face and out of breath. He asked if I would help get a couch up the stairs (we were on the second floor of the apartment complex). I reluctantly agreed and went out to help.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, I must explain how the stairs were laid out in the complex. There were two sets of stairs up: one with a bend half way up and one that went straight up. Here&#39;s a handy diagram:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1XpZX.jpg" alt="" title="A Diagram"></p>
<p>Gradients are stairs, red arrows how one gets up them.</p>
<p>So I walk out and see that they&#39;re trying to take the couch up the set of stairs with the bend and they were stuck getting it around the last corner. This is idiotic in and of itself as they could&#39;ve taken the straight stairs up and encountered no issues. It was the system of ropes and winches that literally caused my jaw to drop as I stared in disbelief for nearly a minute. The couch was actually dangling above the ground, anchored from the stairs going to the third floor.</p>
<p>I did wind up helping them get around the corner and immediately retreated to my room still in disbelief.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Today&#x27;s Post is Garbage</h2><time>July 5, 2012</time><div><p>Today, I was having an argument with my brother about multidimensional arrays and coordinate systems. The specifics are a bit complex to go over here, but at its core, he wasn&#39;t mentally picture the structure of an array correctly and so was reading his array&#39;s wrong causing them to display as if they were rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really remember having any issues when dealing with arrays, though these days, I generally stick to single dimensional arrays and use math if I need to convert from, say, a screen coordinate to its corresponding spot in the data structure. Particularly, and in the case of our argument, we were talking about reading in a map file. That got me thinking about this trinket I wrote several years ago.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/goomba.jpg" alt="" title="So majestic"></p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Goomba.zip">Download Source</a></p>
<p>If I recall, this test was more about scripted AI and platform physics, but there was a loadable map aspect as well. Maps are something I&#39;ve played around with for a very long time, one of my first programming mental puzzles being how to generate one that wasn&#39;t gibberish programatically. This was something that baffled me for the longest time, but I eventually did figure something out and even wrote a <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/randmaps.html">tutorial about it</a>.</p>
<p>But, really, this whole little tale and code offering are because I had no idea what to talk about otherwise. I suspect I shall have less issues tomorrow (for reasons that will become clear), but that hardly helps me in the here and now.</p>

<p>For over half a decade, <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> has been the sight that has greeted me as I started my browser and many times when I clicked the &quot;home&quot; button of my browser (a button I&#39;ve had to explicitly enable in Chrome).

<p>Now, I&#39;d had a hunch that iGoogle was getting less than stellar treatment lately as it became very difficult to make iGoogle my default page for google.com and also when its design was broken through their extensive redesigning. Perhaps the personal web portal is passe at this point, but I will surely miss it. iGoogle has provided me with an at-a-glance preview of my mail and a handful of other website snippets since its inception in 2005.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&#39;ve been using less and less of the gadgets (or whatever they call them), slowly being culled down from my email and RSS feeds from various websites and webcomics to just mail, a deviantArt gadget that I don&#39;t pay attention to anymore, and the RSS feed from my <a href="http://www.square-headed.com/">brother&#39;s comic</a>. Outside of the casual overview of my email, I don&#39;t really take advantage of functionality of iGoogle anymore as I&#39;ve moved away to better, dedicated applications and sites such as <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and the ever present <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, I&#39;m a programmer, dammit! I can build myself a site that not only provides the same functionality I used before, but make it better, faster, stronger, and more tailored to my needs! I have sixteen months to replace the death row inmate that is iGoogle and replace it I shall.</p>
<p>I shall...</p>

<p>Some time ago, I came to the realization that I could (for free) check out movies from the local library. As convenience would have it, the library is about half a mile from my place of work, so it provides an excellent reason to get in some exercise during my lunch break.</p>
<p>Last week - on one of these very journeys - I was perusing the blu-ray section and ran across a couple of films. One I&#39;d seen, the other not: <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>  and <em>Blade Runner</em> respectively. Now, I shouldn&#39;t have to remind you of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/2000wtf/">feelings for <em>2001</em></a>, but I thought perhaps my six years of maturation since having watched it initially may have changed things. <em>Blade Runner</em> I picked up partially based on glowing reviews from a coworker, partially because I felt I was going to need some badass 80s action movie to pick me up after rewatching <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>Well, I fucked that one up.</p>
<p><em>2001</em> was watched first and, for the most part, my feelings towards the movie are mostly the same; it&#39;s slow, it doesn&#39;t make much sense, but the special effects are quite incredible for the time. About half way through the movie, I threw up my arms in defeat and got wasted. Inebriation didn&#39;t help much my enjoyment of the movie nor did it provide any epiphanies (I suspect that only getting stoned is going to help you there). But, that was okay. I knew going in about what to expect and I still had some Harrison Ford awesomeness to look forward to.</p>
<p>Only I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Because, in many ways, <em>2001</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> are very similar movies: they&#39;re both slow, they both don&#39;t make much sense, and they both have very good effects for their time. I went into <em>Blade Runner</em> expecting an action flick starring one of the best action stars of all time - something akin to Die Hard - but, instead I got a noir film set in a dystopian future that focuses on android&#39;s rights. Not what I was expecting at all.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t lie - and keeping in mind what I was expecting - I did not very much enjoy <em>Blade Runner</em>. Firstly, I&#39;m not entirely partial to dark films (both figuratively and literally in this case) and I&#39;ll give <em>2001</em> props for at least being a hopeful movie. Secondly, the soundtrack for <em>Blade Runner</em> is so 80s psychedelic that it almost made me feel like I was tripping balls despite the fact that I was entirely sober for that film. <em>2001</em>, on the other hand, uses nothing but classical music for its score, so point again. Finally, <em>Blade Runner</em>&#39;s basic premise of &quot;what are the rights of a manufactured life form&quot; has been done <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor">time</a> and <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">again</a>. Also, while I did say it didn&#39;t make much sense, <em>Blade Runner</em> was at least a bit easier to piece together than <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say this, I have to say that I enjoyed <em>2001</em> much more than <em>Blade Runner</em>. I don&#39;t necessarily hate <em>Blade Runner</em>, but it&#39;s just not a movie suited to my tastes.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Return of the Daily Blogging</h2><time>June 30, 2012</time><div><p>In the sixth month of the prior year, I endeavored to blog once per day for the entire month. Seeing how this blog is currently collecting figurative dust, I feel like I should try this again. Some days shall be easier than others as the <a href="http://tokyointulsa.com/">anime convention</a> happens this month. Additionally, I shall be taking a trip to Dallas with my dad and brothers to partake in the excitingness that is Six Flags over Texas. I quite enjoy the thrill of rollar coasters, I do.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m a bit drunk at the moment and the room is quite spinning, so this blog shall have to remain as it is, but expect there to be <em>something</em> on the face of this blog every day for the month of July. I will leave off with the first thing that came up for a google image search of &quot;drunk&quot;.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Adventures in a Galaxy Far, Far Away</h2><time>June 7, 2012</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/books_sw.jpg" alt="" title="The Jedi Archives, last bastion of knowledge in a crumbling universe."></p>
<p>As stated before, I don&#39;t recall exactly when I learned to read; there is just the period of my life before literacy and the period after. I must&#39;ve learned it while I was still going to school, but the details escape me. I remember reading stuff while there, but not what was read save for one thing: the Boxcar Children. It was read during class at some point and, while I wasn&#39;t necessarily enthralled during that time, I remembered enough to make attack a mountain of Boxcar Children books that were given to us by my Scholastic employed Godmother. I don&#39;t know how many of those things I read, but it was quite a lot. How a series goes from being a one-off tale about orphans living in a box car and finding family to various tales of adventure and mystery is beyond me. I suspect these were all pretty shitty books. Even then, I was never able to finish the second one despite numerous attempts to do so. Not sure why...</p>
<p>Another series that I read a fair amount of in my younger years was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a>. I don&#39;t think there are very many children of the 90s who <em>didn&#39;t</em> read Goosebumps. Again, I don&#39;t recall much about these save for two things: they scared the shit out of me and Say Cheese and Die was awesome. Actually, thinking back on the story, it&#39;s a little like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_note">Death Note</a>, only the Note in this case is a camera and the bearer doesn&#39;t actually intend for people to die. I think maybe I should read that book again...</p>
<p>There were other books and series in there: the Hardy Boys, Lord of the Rings, the Belgariad and its sequel, and various classics in the form of <a href="http://www.seriesbooks.com/cart/catalog.aspx?cid=222">Moby Books</a> amoungst others. But there&#39;s one fictional universe in particular that has shaped my life in more ways than I could possibly imagine, from the sheer amount of time spent reading to actual changes in my behaviour. I am, of course, talking about Star Wars.</p>
<p>To date, I have read no less than 78 Star Wars books (yes, I&#39;ve counted), ranging from the first, small novels by Alan Dean Foster up to the New Jedi Order series and its whopping nineteen novels. I don&#39;t know exactly what my first Star Wars book was, but I&#39;m inclined to say it was probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Jedi_Knights_Series">Junior Jedi Knights</a> book <em>The Golden Globe</em> which I read when I was twelve. I didn&#39;t spend too long in that series initially and quickly &quot;graduated&quot; to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Jedi_Knights">Young Jedi Knights</a>. Finally eschewing the children&#39;s series, I went on to read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jedi_Academy_trilogy">Jedi Academy trilogy</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Wing_Series">X-wing series</a>, and of course, the phenomenal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrawn_trilogy">Thrawn trilogy</a>. To this day, the Thrawn trilogy is probably my favorite series of books and its author, Timothy Zahn, also amoungst my favorites.</p>
<p>At my peak, I was reading at the pace of a Star Wars novel a day, sometimes blowing through three or four a week. Star Wars literature - and the universe that it created in my mind - engrossed me for probably a good six or seven years of my life. I cannot think any other single thing in my life that so consumed me. All good things must come to an end, however, and once I completed the New Jedi Order series, my Star Wars mania was spent. The last time I picked up a Star Wars book was in late &#39;08 as I waited overnight for a bus at the Orlando airport. But, I do not regret for a minute the time that I spent behind the pages of these books. I actually attribute a lot of my English skills - from spoken to written - to these books. I know for a fact that it was in a Star Wars novel that I first encountered the word &quot;ricochet&quot;, the phrases &quot;oft used&quot; and &quot;delusions of granduer&quot;, and how I began the use of the term &quot;blast&quot; in swearing (something one of my former bosses thought was &quot;cute&quot;).</p>
<p>After my Star Wars days, my reading of fiction dropped to almost nothing for the longest time; partially because I began working, partially due to the internet and site like Slashdot and Digg which provided articles relevant to my interests. I wouldn&#39;t become heavily invested in reading again until mid 2009 as a new genre caught my attention...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Reminiscing Walk Through Literature</h2><time>June 4, 2012</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/books_bb.jpg" alt="" title="It was a super cheap gift, to be fair..."></p>
<p>Ever since I was a wee lad, reading has been more or less a main stay past time of mine. Even before I myself could read (an act I don&#39;t recall learning), books have been a part of my life in some form or fashion. For the next couple of posts - as it&#39;s the best idea I&#39;ve had for a blog post in these weeks of drought - I will do some meandering through time, summoning memories of the books and book related experiences in my life. Also, I&#39;m about to turn another year older, so I&#39;m trying to forget about that by living in the past.</p>
<p>In a manner befitting sitcom television of the 80s and 90s, the bedtime story was an established ritual in my family. Mom and sometimes Dad would read a book or two (or a portion of a book, if it was longer) to us after teeth brushing but before we&#39;d be confined to the late night prison of our room. This went on for quite a while, carried over into the lives of my younger siblings, and is still sometimes revived today. I probably appreciate it in a different light now than I did when I was younger, much the same as family meal time.</p>
<p>A lot of what was read were the usuals that all kids grow up with: Green Eggs and Ham; Goodnight Moon; Go, Dog, Go; Wynken, Blynken, and Nod; etc and so forth. I do particularly recall a set of <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sesame_Street_Library">Sesame Street books</a> that we owned, which also reminds me of the Ernie plushie I had at about that time (incidentally, my favorite character). But, I digress. There were also some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Golden_Books">Little Golden Books</a> in our library. I can still recall the taste of the foiled spines...</p>
<p>Of all the books that were ever read to me, however, there&#39;s one that stands out in my mind as being far and above the others (it also makes a great, heart warming tale to tell): the Hobbit. I don&#39;t recall exactly when this happened (general consensus places me at about 8 or 9), but my dad decided one day that we - then, Jeff, Chris, and myself - needed to experience this grande tale of adventure and theiving. I seem to recall not being enthralled by the idea of being read to initially (I was able to read at the time), but within a couple of chapters (one per night) we were all hooked. This was, of course, long before Lord of the Rings was turned into a theatrical masterpiece, but I&#39;ll be damned if my dad didn&#39;t nail Gollum&#39;s voice before it was even a thought in Andy Serkis&#39; head. This experience left such an impression on my life that I fully plan on doing the same with my own children (regardless of whether they are boys or girls).</p>
<p>Counter to that, my mom read us a few of the Little House on the Prarie books (a personal favorite series of hers). I&#39;ll be honest: there are some okay parts, but as a wild young boy, the on-goings of a girl and her family in no-man&#39;s land didn&#39;t entirely capture my attention (sorry, mom). Luckily for her, she was able to reread these to my sisters recently, who probably enjoyed them more than I did. I was able to listen in on her reading this a few times, and approaching the text with my filthy, adult mind makes for some good times (though, not so much for the person reading aloud. Again, sorry mom).</p>
<p>There are more tales to tell, I&#39;m sure (books we read in school and such), but that&#39;s the beginnings of my literacy life in a nutshell. Next time, I&#39;ll explore the world I opened of my own volition and where it&#39;s lead me today.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Me of Yore - Finale</h2><time>May 20, 2012</time><div><p>It&#39;s been a while since I posted a journal entry (or anything, really), and the interestingness of this final journal is drying up. So, I&#39;m going to jump to the most important entry in there; the entry that, looking back on it, in many ways kick started my life on the path that has led me here. Without further ado:</p>
<p>[quote]Today was the oddest/horrible days of my life. It started off fairly normal. We got ready for Mass and headed off as usual. We drove towards Tulsa in conditioned comfort. We were nearly in town when the van started acting up. Mom ordered everyone out of the van. It wasn&#39;t until I got out until I noticed the smoke billowing off the hood. As we backed away from the van we noticed flames under it. A couple of people from the parish stopped. Some other guy stopped and poked around in the van. Mom and Mary Cook were screaming at him to beat it. By the time the fire truck was passing on the other side the van was engulfed in flames. They did get it out and there stood the blackened courpse of what used to be our mode of transportation. So Jeff, Steve, Maggie and I hitched a ride to the curch with the Howzers. When the others got there, Mr. Howzer drove us home. Next to that nothing else has really happened. Okay, I scraped my knee. But it&#39;s late (and raining) and I&#39;m off to bed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Name spelling errata aside, the van burning up was actually a fairly large turning point in family history. I don&#39;t think any one thing that followed is necessarily directly attributable, but it was the &quot;big event&quot; upon which other smaller, but more important events happened very close to.</p>
<p>Shortly after the car barbecue, we got the enormous, <a href="http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/express-1500/2001/">15 passenger van</a> that is now the Hackmobile and also the vehicle with which I learned to drive. With that in our possession, it seemed like we began to do more things within the parish, such as my creating and running of their website (my first real experience doing web work outside of for my own fancy or the YPN) in addition to myself and the two younger brothers behind me becoming <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/attention-span-0/">altar boys</a>.</p>
<p>In all this, I began to get my programming skills known and also begin the long process of shedding my introversion and bringing a level of normality to my social skills (a thing that is still ongoing, it seems). Again, I don&#39;t know if the event of the Crispy Van (as it was later called) is directly involved in any of this, but it was certainly something memorable. But, the fire was not without casualties.</p>
<p>My brother&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/KB-Gear-JamP3-Digital-Player/dp/B000050AVW">JamP3</a> didn&#39;t survive.</p>

<p>Surely this needs <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-year-of-music-now-with-interactive-graphs/">no introduction</a> at this point.</p>
<p>My brother Chris and I are heavy users of my music page to the point that we have &quot;fight&quot; over what songs show up in the trending list. Now, this is a bit difficult because our listening habits are quite different and we have a lot of overlap in music tastes.</p>
<p>Now, if you clicked that link up there (or recall from when that post when up), I log each and every song that is played. This is a never ending source of fun for me as I constantly find new ways of interpreting the data, the <a href="http://music.dxprog.com/dt10.php?year=2012">Dx Top 10</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>That said, it has been some time since I&#39;ve crunched these numbers into some nice graphs, so I thought it would be fun to display our battle for dominance as such. The following data was culled from February to April of this year (where I began accurately tracking who played what). For additional details, hover over a row.</p>[break]

<p>As you can see, I listen to a much more diverse selection of music than my brother. Having lived with him, I know that when he gets stuck on a song, he will listen to it many times over, back to back. What I generally do is queue up whatever serves my fancy and then let it play through the entire library randomly for the rest of the day. Keep this in mind as you pore over the following graphs.</p>

<p>I would like to make a special note here about Chris&#39; plays of Another Heaven and A.R. were added to the page on 4/17 and 4/21 respectively. So, his high play count for those two songs were crammed into a very short period of time.</p>

<p>Now this is what I find most fascinating: numbers reflecting our lives. I have a desk job with a constant connection to the internet, so most of my playing happens at work during normal business hours. Chris works a super early shift at Wal-Mart, so his sond playing doesn&#39;t really begin until he gets home in the afternoon. However, he&#39;s pretty solid whereas I taper off throughout the day... that is until after my nap in the evening when I begin programming.</p>
<p>So, that was fun. I&#39;ll probably do this again in another few months as I&#39;ve added additional statistics into the logs, namely when a song is played through its entirety and when it&#39;s skipped. Until next time.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {

$(&#39;.doubleGraph&#39;).each(function() {

var

maxLeft = 0,
maxRight = 0,
$this = $(this);

$this.find(&#39;tbody tr&#39;).each(function() {
var
$this = $(this),
left = parseInt($this.find(&#39;td.left span&#39;).text()),
right = parseInt($this.find(&#39;td.right&#39;).text());

<p>[quote]Entry 2 - June 9, 2002</p>
<p>Well I have now been sixteen for twenty-four hours. Nothing special. We went to Mass as usual. Afterward we went to Gardener&#39;s and looked around a while. I found an HTML book for Chris. Mom found an old Catholic text book for a buck. We came home to some stew Dad cooked up. It was really good. After that I played some Dr. Mario. Then I worked up an ASP program to hold my financial stuff. Then we went to bed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, there is something to be mentioned here. Gardners, erroneously spelled above, is a local used bookstore. Back in my youth, it was a great place to ogle over almost irrelevant programming books (most of which are actually still at the store today). Nowadays, I ignore the computer section entirely and mostly peruse the manga section ($5 tankoban is a pretty good deal).</p>
<p>[quote]Entry 3 - June 10, 2002</p>
<p>An amazing this happened today. I completed every subject in school! I also finished my Mockingbird synopsis. Amazery! And on top of all that, I made it through level twenty of Dr. Mario. I also chatted with &quot;kpyro&quot; on AOL. So over today  was really good.[/quote]</p>
<p>kypyro was one of the first and only people I ever talked with off the YPN boards and at that it was very brief. I don&#39;t recall why, but I came to distrust him at one point. The only actual person I chat with from those days anymore hadn&#39;t even joined YPN at that point.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/journal_steve.jpg" alt="" title="The doorway into another realm"></p>
<p>It would seem that while I was away at college, my brother Steve saw fit to claim my property as his own and pour his own thoughts on paper. As payback for soiling my stuff, I will dump the best entries here. HAHA!</p>
<p>[quote]Entry 3: 12-3-07</p>
<p>Today was  a regular day.Today on the advent calendar we saw a blind man. Thats it.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote]Entry 5: 12-12-07</p>
<p>Today was hectic. I woke up about 11:00 o clock. We had lunch. Then Mom and me went to pick up Verna. I had to go because Mom wanted to get me some new mass shoes because I had to serve tonight.  Mom bought a 60 pair of shoes. So we went to Wal Mart just in case we could find anything cheaper (and better). We found a pair but we didn&#39;t get them. Then we got me a mass shirt. Then we went. When it was time to go I put on all me new stuff. We got me socks to. Then we went. When we got outside I said shotgun first but didn&#39;t get to sit up front!! &gt;:( !!! When we got to church Mom escorted me to the sacristy. There I put on a cassick, surplice, and a cape. Father Festas was ate so immediately after he got dressed mass started. As we were walking down the aidle deacon Joe noticed that my cape was inside out. Well that really stank. After mass I put out the candles but I didn&#39;t put out the advent wreath candles because I didn&#39;t think I was supposed to. Then we went home. Dad got Taco Bell for supper because we hadn&#39;t had any supper because mass was at 5:15. Then we watched the Santa Claus. While mom and I were shopping everyone made peppermint bark. Well my hand is killing me now so I&#39;ll quit.[/quote]</p>
<p>Funnily enough, out of the sixteen entries he wrote, this is the only one that doesn&#39;t end in the phrase &quot;Well, that&#39;s it&quot;.</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting (or perhaps disconcerting) is the fact that his prose is nigh identical to my own in my first few entries. Those three word sentences are poetic beauty. Granted, he was only eleven at the time of these writings whereas I was thirteen. Perhaps I was a little behind the curve...</p>
<p>He&#39;s made up for it in the five years since, though. He recently entered a <a href="http://balmoraman.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4thww5">piece</a> into a writing contest held by the local library and took away <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2012/04/friday-at-last/">second place</a> (netting him a not too shabby $50 prize). More than I can say for myself at that age.</p>
<p>At sixteen I was busy destroying the YPN...</p>

<p>[quote]Entry 1 - June 8, 2002</p>
<p>Well today was my birthday. Sixteen at last. While today was great, it was kind of odd too. It started off with me getting up at three AM. I checked my mail and watched cartoons. Jeff joined about four-thirty. While he was watching cartoons, I worked on my new VB site, Visual Basic Gaming Universe. My intent is to join the VB gaming webring, and maybe win an award. I fell asleep on the couch and didn&#39;t wake up until about ten or so. After I got dressed and ate, I started on my cake. Unfortunatly, I messed that one up. So mom rushed out and got a couple more boxes of mix and that one went okay. While that was baking, we had lunch. Then mom went out to take some newspapers to ARC, while Jeff, Chris and I picked up. When mom got back, she and I rushed right back out to get a camera. When we got back, I frosted my cake and Grandma came a few minutes after that. We had the normal ritual of opening presents. No duh! :) From Mom, Dad, and the rest I got a really cool pocket knife, Dr. Mario, this journal, and the Ep II soundtrack, and from Grandma I got thirty bucks. After Grandma left, Mom let me work on VBGU some more. Then she and Dad did shopping. When they got back I played some Dr. Mario. Joey jumped on me and I hurt him so I got in trouble. After that I went to our room and was sleeping until about now. So it was a pretty good day overall.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not much to say here, though my acceptance of commas in the year between journal entries is certainly welcomed. I still seem unable to write a non-disjointed narrative, though. It&#39;s disconcerting to say the least.</p>
<p>Also, webrings...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Me of Yore Part 11 - Lying To Myself</h2><time>April 15, 2012</time><div><p>As I begin the scribblings of the next comic, I&#39;ll fill in the gap with a bit more journal. Incidentally, I&#39;m running out of these; this is the last entry in book two of three.</p>
<p>[quote]May 9, 2001 - Eleventh Entry</p>
<p>Hi! Lot of stuff goiong on. First of all I was actually succesful in making a game in vb. It is a game Jeff requested. You fly around in a spaceship and shoot down aliens. Also Im going to build a computer from stuff off of eBay. I have the process which is an Amd 486 Dx4 100mhz. I am currently watching a compatible motherboard. [various statement redacted] Oh well. I&#39;m on the St. Jhon&#39;s ball team this year, and I am not as pathetic as I thought. In fact i&#39;m pretty good. Maggie is crawling now. She is also pulling up on the couch. Well my hand is getting tired so it&#39;s time to wrap it up. Bye.[/quote]</p>
<p>I recall quite well my time on my church&#39;s softball team. And, no, I was not good. Also, I was in early pubescence and emotional as shit. There is one particular instance of tear filled rage that I remember more clearly than I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>We&#39;d just lost game one of a double header and I was playing catcher (as I was wont to d0). Every time I failed to get the softball back to our pitcher, he&#39;d give me &quot;you-fucking-idiot&quot; look (which only exacerbated the issue); there was play at the plate where I fumbled the ball and, as I dejectedly moped after it thinking that this bout of activity was done, the jackass on third stole home. This only made my mood worse and by the end of the game I was a shaking, tear filled mess (needless to say we lost). I stormed off the field and, between sobs, angrily told my dad that I wanted to quit the team. I don&#39;t know really remember much after that, but I calmed down enough to play game two (which went better) and finished out the season. The team dissolved after that (perhaps I was to blame) and my softball career was cut short. I went on to join the bowling league the next year with much better results.</p>
<p>To this day, I still don&#39;t have a very high opinion of the guy who pitched that game. Ironically, he lives not far from my parents&#39; current residence, though I was lucky enough to never run into him. If I had, I probably would&#39;ve chucked a softball into his shins which would&#39;ve exploded from the sheer awesomeness of my pitch.</p>
<p>Because when I throw a ball now, it goes exactly where the fuck I want it to.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Me of Yore: Part 10 - Time Skip</h2><time>April 8, 2012</time><div><p>After digging through some boxes, I have recovered my journal and with it my free source of blogging material. I shan&#39;t waste time here, so let&#39;s jump right into my stupidity and outlandish claims!</p>
<p>[quote]Tenth Entry - February 18, 2001</p>
<p>Hi! Now I have to catch up on the last 1/2 year of stuff. Maggie was born on october 2. Now she is almost five months old. This week she (and Joe and Steve) have been sick. And me... I&#39;M IMMUNE. My programming has progressed a ways. I&#39;ve mastered HTML and I&#39;m going on VBScript. I have been looking at versions of VBasic on eBay. Most of VB6 go for $70 or higher. So I&#39;m thinking of making my own computer from stuff on eBay. If you are wondering how I&#39;m going to get the dough, aside from my B-Day money, I got a, get some iron straps and brace yourself, $10.60 from sales at Biblio. Also, grandma has hired me to mow her lawn this summer. But now I&#39;m getting off the subject. I have learned some DirectX for VB. My webpage is pretty snazzy. I am now doing Algebra I for school. Two or three weeks ago I made a real bow. And it actually works. Well, that&#39;s all.[/quote]</p>
<p>If I recall, this is the year that I managed to skip getting sick with the rest of the family (hence the &quot;I&#39;m immune&quot; comment). Sickness in the Hackmann residence is, on the whole, a very clock-work process: twice a year, generally in early fall and late winter, the entire family gets the basic cold. Sore throat, achey body, and what I affectionately refer to as the &quot;sickness delerium&quot;. I&#39;ve skipped a sickness cycle this year as well, of which I&#39;m mildly nervous about...</p>
<p>Moving on, the money of which I spoke was from taking some books into a local home school book consignment store (Biblio). That I would make any money off that at all blew my tiny, fragile little mind and I obviously extrapolated the potential to a ridiculous degree. Though, if my fourteen year old self were to know about the ~8 cheap, thrift store computers that are sitting in my closet, he&#39;d probably shit a brick. I plan to do something grande with those computers one of these days, but today is not that day.</p>
<p>Nor is tomorrow...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>And Now For Some Clarity</h2><time>March 17, 2012</time><div><p>Pun totally intended :D</p>
<p>If you managed to stumble upon my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/blid-blog-rampagge">previous blog post</a>, you may be wondering how drunk I was exactly. Except you won&#39;t, because LASIK was one of the only words that managed to not be garbled in my blind fury.</p>
<p>Today, however, things are healing up nicely and my vision is beyond awesome. Like, as of less than twenty-four hours after operation I was seeing between 20/20 and 20/15 and it had yet to stop improving. Even with glasses I never had vision this sharp. Jeff and I went bowling last night and I was able to see every individual pin on nearly every lane in the alley (some 40 lanes); we went to Target and I could read all the aisle signs from the entrance. I&#39;m still making small discoveries that just blow me away.</p>
<p>And it all began with a less than ten minute operation. Actually, it began with my <a href="http://richardcox.net/">boss</a> mentioning and explaining it during one of our project meetings. I signed up for the free consult, made the arrangements, managed to get over my fear of having my eyes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasik#Flap_creation">slit open</a>, and here I am.</p>
<p>So, now I have super vision (which I will be paying for in monthly installments for the next several months), but totally worth it. I would do it all again in a heartbeat!</p>
<p>That aside, I shall be resuming the journal entries shortly. The last few weeks were made preparing to move apartments as my brother Jeff moved in, so we&#39;re recovering from that yet. Look forward to it!</p>

Hi. Long time since I last wrote an entry. I&#39;ve come aways in QB. I have a program that will load .gif files in QB. I also have a program that will make gifs. gotta go bye![/quote]</p>
<p>I distinctly remember when I discovered the ability to load external graphics into my QBasic programs; it was something quite magical. Why I didn&#39;t go with Windows bitmaps as my format of choice, I don&#39;t know (super simple files to read), but what&#39;s interesting is that &quot;program that will makes gifs&quot; was none other than the original PSP - Paint Shop Pro. This was my first real interaction with a real graphics program and yet another piece of the puzzle that got me where I am today.</p>

Good news. I OWN VBASIC!!! I also own ROGUE SQUADRON! And IT&#39;S a girl!!!!! I also have a web page. Dan is going to mail me Turbo C++ with compiler. We have made a music album. We also have web again. [statement redacted] Leah e-mails me quite often. Well I have to go. Bye![/quote]</p>
<p>For my fourteenth birthday, my parents got me a (gimped) version of Visual Basic 6 that I had been eyeing at our local staples for months. I know for a fact that there&#39;s a picture of me cradling it with a dreamy look in my eyes hanging around somewhere (hint hint, mom). I also got a bitchin&#39; shark pillow that year (which I appropriately named &quot;Sharkey&quot;). Sadly, Sharkey is no longer with us and spends his days chilling underneath a mountain of trash somewhere west of Bartlesville.</p>
<p>Another interesting bit: the &quot;web&quot; of which I refer to was Juno, a free provider that had the most annoying ad window thingy. But, hey. Free internet without all the restrictions that the AOL software brought to it (no internet for other programs).</p>

Well VB5 is out of the question. The Damn software doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve almost made it through Ando Prime on E1R (Episode I Racer). That&#39;s right I&#39;ve been playing it. I&#39;ve been listening to my CD player like crazy. We&#39;ve had alot of snow lately. I made a fort for me and the other two (i.e. Jeff, Chris). We&#39;ve had several fights over the last few days. The first one I annilated their for. Well gotta go. Tottles.[/quote]</p>

Well This is going to be a big entry. We figured out how to get Ep 1 Racer working. You have to have Sonic &amp; Knuckles in the background. I&#39;m going to make FF (first fantasy). It&#39;s going to be 3D. Anyways, the big news is mom&#39;s pregnant again. Tootles.[/quote]</p>
<p>Poor Maggie (the aforementioned fetus). The announcement of her coming into being is overshadowed by the details of how we got around a particularly annoying issue in Episode I Racer. I guess by the time sibling number five rolls around, the whole idea just kind of lost its charm. That, and at the time of this writing Maggie could very well have been brother number five.</p>
<p>Also, why is it I abbreviated Episode I Racer that one time (and then bothered to spell it out later)? And why can I spell &quot;tootles&quot; correct one week, but not another? And what is Damn software?</p>

<p>Jan 19, 2000</p>
<p>Hello. I heard from Leah yesterday. Boy did she get alot of stuff for Christmas. She obviously has a computer. Her letter was printed. By accident I found out mom&#39;s e-mail address. It&#39;s [redacted]@hotmail.com. Kinda neat! So I e-mailed her today and I&#39;M ALIVE!!! I have officially finished Excel! I made a cards program. Next is VB 5 and then DIRECTX. Thats right it&#39;s a LANGUAGE. So I will climb in the world. I&#39;ll be a top programmer at 15. Anyways gotta run. Bye![/quote]</p>
<p>We&#39;ll gloss over my erroneous comments about DirectX being a language or the fact that knowing my mother&#39;s email address at the time would&#39;ve meant certain death, and skip to the single most awesome thing I&#39;ve read in all these journal entries thus far; the bold delcaration of having &quot;officially finished Excel&quot;.</p>
<p>How does one &quot;finish&quot; Excel? Does it involve an end boss fight with pivot tables and a cell formula with many functions? Who declared this &quot;finishing&quot; official? It&#39;s true that my Excel VBA skills exceed that of your standard user (in large part because of my father), but this declaration just doesn&#39;t hold any kind of matter.</p>
<p>But, let&#39;s face it; I was also under the delusion that programming in VB and DirectX was going to make me a &quot;top programmer&quot;, and at fifteen, no less.</p>

<p>[quote]Well I know new stuff in math now. Dad showed me some stuff last night. Jeff is continuing to write his Zelda book. Dad is in the living room playing the game that came with the joystick: WarBirds 2.01. It looks like alot of fun. I&#39;m gonna play it tomorrow. I fired some christmas cards off to my pen pals. Jeff is buying books in bulk. He wants 700. But I&#39;m giving him 20. That&#39;s a buck! Some dough I can add to my hastings card. Chris wants ten also. That&#39;s another 50 cents. I made it first in the die hard 500 on my Nascar game. Coming a little further on my puzzle. The water is really hard. My VBasic Classes are getting into animation now! I spent an hour doing that today! Well that&#39;s all for now.[/quote]</p>
<p>This reminded me of a little &quot;business&quot; I had called Bookings. Bookings&#39; entire business model was centered around construction paper stapled to a few sheets of copy paper and then, apparently, sold for a nickle. Jeff was making comics at the time (something he <a href="http://square-headed.com/">still does</a>), so I attempted capitalize off of it.</p>
<p>Also, these &quot;VBasic Classes&quot; of which I mention I believe were from a book on Excel VBA and the &quot;card program&quot; was a cataloging system for baseball cards (I had/have a fair amount of Topps 1993 series cards). Apparently, that Derek Jeter rookie card is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Topps-Derek-Jeter-Rookie-Yankees/dp/B000LV7UIS">worth something</a>. And I&#39;ve got a few of those, iirc...</p>

<p>I cannot disagree; that was a pretty awesome Christmas. Episode I Racer I particularly have very fond memories of.

Additionally, in the time between this and the previous post, our family procured our first (modern) computer. I can still rattle off the specs:</p>
<p>Dell XPS-T450 (service tag 72y1a)</p>
<ul>
<li>450Mhz Pentium III</li>
<li>128MB RAM</li>
<li>Voodoo 3 3000 w/ 16MB VRAM</li>

Hi! It&#39;s been awhile since I last wrote. I got another letter from Leah. I sent one to John again. I&#39;m hoping to get a letter from him this week. [two statements redacted for personal reasons] Also the Birthright garage sale is on Friday and Mom is going to get me some art pencils. Joey is scooting around now. He is really big. Grandpa is in the hospital. It doesn&#39;t look good either. Dave came up. It was nice to visit with him. DFad is going to let me send and recieve e-mails via his address. I can&#39;t get my own because I was on QB chat. Speaking of QBasic I&#39;m making a new game. It&#39;s called Mario Mash. I&#39;m just about finished. All I need to add is sound and music. My fish is still around. He also knows a trick. When I feed him I flip the food down off the shelf and he goes crazy. We&#39;re almost finished our first month of school. It&#39;s kinda easy except for English. I&#39;m learning about the French-Indian War. It&#39;s really neat. Well gotta go. Bye![/quote]</p>

<p>The greatly anticipated moment has come and gone. WE&#39;VE SEEN THE PHANTOM MENACE!! It was awesome! I&#39;ve taken Jeff up as my Padawan Apprentice. He&#39;s excited. I&#39;ve also tackled something new in T-Attack... x6 and x5! We went swimming again on Tuesday. I did a flip perfectly and NO ONE WAS WATCHING!!! So I kept trying. I was going to show mom after doing several 1 1/2 flips and the DAMN WHISTLE BLEW. My foots healed. A few days ago I got my first zit. So we got some zit cream. Got another letter from my pen pal. Still need to send my letter. Tomorrow my bros and I are secretly going to make breakfast. I made a kite last Sunday. Don&#39;t know if it flys yet though. I also did B-Day shopping for Stevie with mom. Time to wrap it up.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not much to say here, though it&#39;s funny how one&#39;s opinions of a movie can change in thirteen years. I don&#39;t hate Episode I, but I certainly do not think it&#39;s &quot;awesome&quot; anymore. That said, I can understand being excited for it as a kid.</p>
<p>Also, making public of dark secrets that I would rather have remained in the dark depths of hell: the &quot;Padawan Apprentice&quot; bit. Somewhere between thirteen and sixteen, I was really into Star Wars. Like, <em>really</em> into it. Enough so that I tried to delude myself and my brothers into thinking that I had originated from that galaxy far, far away and was reincarnated here or some shit. Call it hardcore pretend or something.</p>

July 28, 1999
It&#39;ll probably take a few pages to catch up on the latest events. Our two weeks were successfully completed. We&#39;re going to see the &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; on Sunday. Yesterday we went swimming. I did a bunch of diving. I also did a 360. I tryed to do a front flip but belly floped. Mom found out I had been on AOL. My computer privaliges have been revoked for a long time. I finally got my thing from Jen. A K-Mart Card. A whopping ten bucks. Whee. My shoe landed at Wisconson. A new record. My foot is just about healled.I got a letter from Val last week. I got a couple neat &quot;Episode I&quot; books. One&#39;s a vehicle cross-section book. The other is &quot;The making of STAR WARS: The Phantom Menace&quot; book. The Mos Espa stands (the people in them anyway) are colored Q-tips. Oh Yeah! I forgot. I got a watch strap with the K-Card. Tomorrow I&#39;m gonna get me some goggles. My day&#39;s of batboy are over. I also got to play. The other team forfieted on our second game. And I finally got to play. Dad&#39;s letting me have his old ball shirt. I fixed it up with the stinky marker. Yuck! My fish is probably close to a couple months old. I used my book certificate to get Jedi Apprentice #2. I hope the library gets #3 soon. That&#39;s right your eyes aren&#39;t play tricks on you. Jedi Apprentice #3 Hidden Past. Great isn&#39;t it. But now as I close this entry is the most exciting news. I HAVE A PEN-PAL!!!! His name is John [name redacted]. I got his letter two days after I got my GO FORTH. Jeff Chis and Stevie were on the list too. And Joey was in the new baby spot. Well! Better get to be. Soon it&#39;s....
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/journal_signoff.jpg" alt="" title="PHANTOM WHAT?!">[/quote]</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong> - For whining about the &quot;meager&quot; K-mart card, I certainly had that money spent &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>Of all the things mentioned here, I latch onto the mention of my fish the most.  This was the last fish I had and also the longest living one, dying somewhere at the incredible age of five years old (at least, five years under my care). At the time this was written, I suspect I had not yet named him. Eventually he came to be known as Fishface, but it was not a conscious &quot;I&#39;m going to here on refer to you as Fishface&quot; kind of thing. I just continually referred to him as that and it stuck. God, I miss that fish....</p>
<p>Also, I myself could not remember what the successful &quot;two weeks&quot; thing was all about. Some bribe from my parents, no doubt. Jeff seems to think that it was going to bed on time for two weeks, which would certainly be fitting for ourselves at the time.</p>
<h2 id="glossary-of-terms">Glossary of Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Go Forth</strong> was a small time Catholic periodical for kids. I don&#39;t remember much about the content outside of the fact that the back page was full of &quot;user generated content,&quot; for lack of a better term, and also a list of kids&#39; names/ages/addresses for the pen pal list. I had no less than three pen pals from that, none of which I have been in contact with for many, many years.</p>

<p>[quote]Third Entry - Festival 66
July 16, 1999
Well today was the day of Festival 66! I got up early this morning. Got my chores done quick. After Chris finished eating we played some nintendo. Mom also called in for my good inhaler. The morning was a drag. Finally lunch came. Festival 66 was at 2:00. I thought it was at 1:00. Oh well! Mom let us play nintendo again. Before you know it it&#39;s time to leave. We parked at the church parking lot. Se we walked to the Credit Union to meet Dad. We picked our lost and found spot and Jeff, Chris and I were off. First we got sprites and went to play games. We went to a ball game first. The point was to get a bunch of the same color on the board. I got a cheesy top. Whee. Next we went to a ring toss game. I ringed a chihuahua and got one. Then we went to bingo. Did Chris ever whine. They were giving away a toaster. I JUST HAD TO WIN! I imagined the look on Mom &amp; Dad&#39;s face when I walked up to them with a chihuahua in one arm and a TOASTER in the other. But I lost. On our way out who do we run into. But Mom and Dad. So we went to a couple other games. Jeff won a baseball helmet at the speed pitch. He won a stray hat at the poker chip toss. Then we went to golf on my second shot I made it into the ring and got some golf balls. We went to back to play bingo. After the game Stevie was getting fussy so mom ordered us out. We went to get something to eat. We found the hot dogs. Boy were they good. Then we got a snowcone. Of course I got grape we sat down to eat them. But halfway through I spilled mine. So we went to play more games. On the way Jeff, who had gone to get a snow cone, mosied off. We found him and went to the rubber band shoot. I hit nothing. But Jeff hit one and got a miniature hat. We were going to our last place when we ran across dad. He said mom had been looking for us. I told him I was going to get a soda. There was a small line so I had to wait. When I got back dad was gone, so I went to our &quot;place&quot;. After a few minutes the rest of the family showed up and we went home. Boy it was great to be in a cool place again. I got a letter from Val, which surprised me. Then mom went to get the groceries. We played nintendo while she was gone. About 8:00 we went down to the court. I beat my old shoe record. I kicked it to... (brace yourself)... ILLINOIS!!! But it cost me my foot. I jumped off from fairly high, barefoot, and killed my left foot. So I hobbled home. We watched the end of a Bob Hope movie. Finally at 9:00 Mom came home... And she forgot my prescription!!! A good day ended in tragedy.[/quote]</p>
<p>This passage alone encapsulates so many aspects of my youth. Also, those super short sentences and terrible use - or lack of use - of punctuation. I shudder.</p>

<p><strong>Festival 66</strong> was a company wide festival of sorts that then Phillips 66 would hold during the summer. They would block off a couple of streets downtown and had carnival games and free food. Being that my dad works for them, we got to partake in the festivities.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The court&quot;</strong> was the playground of a school down the street from us. Adjacent to the swing set they had was a giant map of the US. I liked to kick my shoes off whilst swinging and used the map as a measurement of distance.</p>

<p>RedditBots Source: [ <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/RedditBots">Download</a> ]</p>
<p>One day, somewhere between Christmas and New Years, a coworker of mine was musing out loud about a vanity reddit account he had created. He was describing exactly what it would do and I was like &quot;dude. We can automate that.&quot; So, in a fury of coding and some poring over reddit documentation, I pulled together a very simple bot that did exactly what he had described. Slapped it on an every ten minutes cron job and called it a day. The code was ugly and I vowed to make a nicer version.</p>
<p>That I did and, while I was at it, decided that I should make it a simple framework with which I could bots in a simple manner and have a central script that managed them all. The above source is what I settled on (complete with a working, if not banned, version of a binky79 clone).</p>
<p>My own bot idea, as it was Christmas, was for a bot named Ebeneezer<em>McUpvote (a portmanteau of Ebenezer Scrooge, Scrooge McDuck and everyone&#39;s favorite reddit term, upvote) to randomly upvote a new link and add the comment &quot;Merry Christmas! Have an upvote ^ </em> Q&quot;. Scripted, running, would execute every five minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Ebeneezer_McUpvote">People hate it.</a></p>
<p>As of this writing, that bot has -310 comment karma. Now here&#39;s where the fickleness of reddit shows through.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as I was browsing, I came upon <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ogjx1/its_439pm_saturday_in_australia_i_am_drunkthis_is/">this post</a>. So, Oprah giving random upvotes is considered cool, eh?</p>
<p>Enter, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/OprahGivesAnUpvote">OprahGivesAnUpvote</a>. She does pretty much EXACTLY the same thing as Ebeneezer_McUpvote, only she says &quot;Look under your chair... you got an UPVOOOOOOOOTE!!&quot;. People love her. OprahGivesAnUpvote has, at this writing, 233 comment karma and she&#39;s only been running since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Why the hatred? I dunno. Maybe people don&#39;t get the joke of Ebeneezer_McUpvote. Maybe the joke just sucks. Maybe it&#39;s not Christmas anymore. Either way, Oprah is loved, McUpvote is not. I&#39;ll be interested to see if Ebeneezer&#39;s fortune turns around when we get closer to Christmas again...</p>

<p>Well, here we are again. It&#39;s always such a pleasure. Remember when I did this <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done/">last year</a>? I do. Seems like it wasn&#39;t that long ago. But, time flies, as they say, and with increasing age, it does so with increased velocity, it seems. This calls for some retrospective and forward contemplation.[break]</p>
<h2 id="the-previous-year">The Previous Year</h2>
<p>As linked above, last year I made a series of goals for myself to achieve. Let&#39;s look in and see how I fared on that:</p>
<p><strong>Draw more</strong> - Could probably count on two hands the amount of times I set pencil to paper for art&#39;s sake. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Finish all my Squeenix games</strong> - Despite a rocky start, I did finish Final Fantasy X-2 (from which I am still having nightmares). Never touched another game on that list. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Lost the spare tire</strong> - My weight held for most of the year, and during the summer months I made a pretty good effort to at least keep in some semblance of physical shape, between climbing the stairs in my office building and running the treadmills. That all died somewhere towards fall, though, and I&#39;ve put on weight since. <em>FAILED</em></p>
<p><strong>Apartment and girlfriend</strong> - Perhaps the only section on the list where I wasn&#39;t a complete failure. Upset with my conditions at my old job, I sought new and greener pastures and got the pay bump I needed to set out on my own (now I&#39;m back at that old job, but with more pay). On the girlfriend front, I&#39;ve made a handful of probes, but at this point I think I&#39;m content where I&#39;m at and will let things fall into place as they come. So, I&#39;m going to say <em>SUCCEEDED</em> on this one.</p>
<h2 id="the-coming-year">The Coming Year</h2>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve looked back on my list of past failures, let&#39;s set up a list of NEW ONES!</p>
<p><strong>MOAR EXERCISE</strong> - I have a good exercise facility at my disposal and I need to utilize it as much as I can. Goal - 3 hours of exercise per week increasing in amount and intensity as my physical endurance improves.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR GAMING</strong> - I didn&#39;t game much over the last year, but still was raking in games (no thanks to the Steam sale...). This year, I aim to finish all of those, but at the very least, this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skyward Sword</li>
<li>Catherine</li>
<li>Tales of Vesperia</li>
<li>Left 4 Dead (1 and 2)</li>
<li>Bioshock</li>
<li>Mass Effect (1 and 2)
If I can hit the Squeenix games, so much the better</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MOAR SOCIALIZING</strong> - I spend far too much time at home surfing reddit when I could be doing fun things with other people (male and female). My thoughts are to join some organized sport (bowling league, for example) or finally show up to a meeting of that Japanese Language group  in town. Any way you look at it, I need to do more with people.</p>
<p><strong>MOAR DRAWING</strong> - Said it before, will say it again: I can never get better unless I just do it.</p>
<p>Well, there we are. Here&#39;s looking at a productive 2012. Right up until we all die on the 21st of December.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Best of Anime Awards - Finale</h2><time>December 31, 2011</time><div><p>Here we are at the final day of the year and our little anime awards show. So, here they are and we&#39;ll see you on the other side!</p>
<h2 id="best-show-of-2011">Best Show of 2011</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - Steins;Gate</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_steins_gate.jpg" alt="" title="Steins;Gate">
Time travel stories are amazing, and this is something I&#39;ve always known.  However, Steins Gate -- a show I started watching out of idle curiosity - has confirmed how badass I think they are.  Why is that, exactly?  Sit your ass down and I&#39;ll tell you.  </p>
<p>Like all good time travel stories, the show starts out all, &quot;Huh?&quot; then proceeds to, &quot;Ah!&quot; and ends on a &quot;I FUCKING UNDERSTAND <em>EVERYTHING</em> NOW.&quot;  You know what really helps these temporal feelings along?  A refreshing cast of badass and well developed characters -- surprisingly light on school girls -- teams up with the plot to create a story so badass that you will sit down on the stoop of your Manhattan apartment and think like a <em>GODDAMN MAN</em>.</p>
<p>Convinced yet?  Not enough info for your tastes?  TOUGH SHIT.  Absorb it through every orifice and be glad you did.[break]</p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Nichijou (My Ordinary Life)</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Nichijou">
Are you looking for a good time? Good, because Nichijou just saw your good time and raised it one shitload of what-the-hell-just-happened?. The title means &quot;ordinary life&quot;, but the show is anything but ordinary. Epic shoops whoop out of people&#39;s mouths, dogs go full retard, cats talk, and there are explosions which turn everything into big, smoking craters of completely unharmed. Yes, you read all of that correctly, and it is all accurate. &quot;Not a single fuck was given that day&quot; sums up this show perfectly, and I would have it no other way.</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Nichijou</strong>
There are a few somethings about Nichijou that separates it from nearly every other anime I&#39;ve watched. First of all is its gratuitous use of slapstick style visual humor. This is something that is present in most of my favorite Western cartoons (Dexter&#39;s Lab, SpongeBob, etc), probably due to the more serious/light-hearted/based in reality nature of most of the shows I&#39;ve watched. The scenarios that Nichijou presents are ridiculous in and of themselves, but its the timing, animation, and supremely awesome voice work takes the insane and makes it exponentially so. I posit the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teFFokJZ8go">following evidence</a> (Wadsworth&#39;s constant applies). Balancing out the insanity side of our equation are the cuteness overload portions of the show with the super intelligent five year-old Professor and her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqqGgSe6qfI">robot maternal figure</a>. Nichijou is pretty much everything I love about anime and Western cartoons rolled into one quite hilarious ball of awesome. It <em>is</em> the complete package.</p>
<h2 id="best-show-watched-in-2011">Best Show Watched in 2011</h2>
<p><strong>Chris - Death Note</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_death_note.jpg" alt="" title="Death Note">
If Death Note came out this year, I would have a tough time deciding between it and Steins; Gate as the best 2011 show, but as it didn&#39;t, this is my way of splitting the highest award.</p>
<p>Death Note is, put simply, a real man&#39;s show.  Singularly focused on the intellectual battle of its main characters -- Light Yagami and L -- this show exudes cerebral juices that will MELT YOUR BRAIN.  If your brain doesn&#39;t melt, you likely didn&#39;t have one to begin with, eliminating your ability to enjoy this show -- a tragedy on a scale not seen since the sinking of the Titanic.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t seen Death Note, watch it now, then go out and buy me the DVDs -- you&#39;ll be glad you did at least one of these things.</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Death Note</strong>
Death Note is a show that one of my college buddies had been pestering me to watch for a really long time. Finally got around to it two years later and I&#39;m glad I finally did. The reason that had kept me away from the show turned out to be one of the most intriguing elements of it: the notebook that can kill anybody by simply writing their name in it (some rules apply). The moral questions raised are enough to ponder on their own merits; would one choose the way of Light Yagami, punishing those who break the law, or that of L who believes that there is no place in the world for any such device? Beyond this, the cat and mouse game played by super geniuses Light, who kills criminals under a psuedonym, and L, who is trying to uncover the identity of the criminal killer, is highly entertaining as you watch each of them calculating their next move to try and attain their goal. Unfortunately, the show did kind of peter out towards the latter half, but it was still an intellectual roller coaster of enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Death Note/Baccano!</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_baccano.jpg" alt="" title="Baccano!">
&quot;Death Note&quot;, or &quot;Baccano!&quot;. This is my quandary. Unfortunately for you, I&#39;m going to cop-out and say both. I can&#39;t choose. &quot;Baccano!&quot; is mystery story that takes place in 1930s United States where the Mafia rule the streets. Most of it even happens on a train. Alchemy is also involved, as well as immortal beings and crazy people who love to shoot guns. How do you go wrong with that? You can&#39;t, and they don&#39;t. &quot;Baccano!&quot; is also home to that lovable crazy couple, Isaac and Miria. If they were to make a show about these two characters alone, I would watch it.
&quot;Death Note&quot;, on the other hand, is a more cerebral experience, where you enjoy the characters and their actions simply by how well they think it all through. Two ultimate masterminds going at it, manipulating everyone around them to get what they want and undermine the other. Good times. What&#39;s more is that you don&#39;t want to see either side lose, because the characters are so great and likeable(UNLIKE SOME CHARACTERS I WILL TALK ABOUT LATER).
I could gush about these two shows all day, but I don&#39;t actually have that much time(that and spoilers). I&#39;ll just go on and say that both shows win the award and be done with it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and have a Happy New Year ^_^!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>2011 Best of Anime Awards - A Bit of Character</h2><time>December 30, 2011</time><div><p>Welcome back, and now for installment two of the 2011 Best of Anime Awards (<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-best-of-anime-awards" target="_blank">Part 1, if you missed it</a>).</p>
<h4>Best Character</h4>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Chris - Rintarou Okabe (<em>Steins;Gate</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_okarin.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>Rintarou Okabe -- aka, mad scientist Hououin Kyouma -- is the main element that makes Steins; Gate amazing.</p>
<p>Okabe starts off over the top, telling everybody he&#39;s a mad scientist and making grand claims about a secret organization that&#39;s keeping tabs on him.  Over the course of the show, however, you see him develop into a very troubled character as the show&#39;s events begin to take their toll on him.  This depth later on really makes you feel for him as a character.</p>
<p>But you know what the best part is?  He&#39;s an ass most of the time, but in a good way, asserting himself over his supposed suboordinates in an over the top fashion.</p>
<p>Gotta love it.</p>
</div>[break]
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Jeff - Graham Spector (<em>Baccano!</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_wrench_guy.jpg" alt="Wrench Guy" />
</p>
<p>Initially, I was going to give this to some character in &quot;Nichijou&quot;, but then I remembered about Wild Tiger, also known as Kotetsu Kaburagi, from &quot;Tiger and Bunny&quot;. Overall, I just think he&#39;s a cool guy. He&#39;s kind of a blundering idiot with a tendency to be overdestructive in his hero efforts, but his heart is in the right place and it shows in how he interacts with the other heroes... And I would be saying that had I not suddenly remembered about the Graham Specter(affectionately called &quot;Wrench Guy&quot; from here out) near the end of &quot;Baccano!&quot;. Seriously, that guy is awesome. He&#39;s spastic, overly talkative, philosophical, mostly harmless, and a prankster. I am saddened by the fact that he showed up only once. Still, his performance was completely solid and I love it. The award goes to Wrench Guy.</p>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Matt - L and Light Yagami (<em>Death Note</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_l_light.jpg" alt="L and Light" />
</p>
<p>I will admit, I&#39;m kind of bending the rules a tad here by including two characters, but it&#39;s one of those times where neither can really stand on their own merits. On the one hand, you&#39;ve got an eccentric, crime fighting super genius who has a penchant for sweets and odd posture, on the other, an outward goody-two-shoes but secretly maniacal sociopath who is using <em>his</em> super genius to rid the world of petty crime. These two and how they&#39;re constantly pitting their wit against each other is the driving force of Death Note and one of the best character combos I&#39;ve seen in recent history (though, I&#39;m sure Captain Haddock and Tintin will be quite awesome).</p>
</div>
<h4>Worst Character (and why I want to kill them)</h4>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Chris - Mello (<em>Death Note</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_mellow.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit that Mello isn&#39;t a terrible character, but he&#39;s arguably the cause behind a handful of misteps about two thirds through Death Note, and it&#39;s largely due to his personality type.</p>
<p>Death Note -- as a matter of necessity -- is dominated by a cast of intelligent and calculating characters.  Mello has very little of these traits, instead being largely driven by kneejerk emotional reactions which don&#39;t fit amidst the company of Light or L.  Placed amongst the cast of a more traditional Shounen series, Mellow would fit right in, he&#39;s just not the right fit here.</p>
<p>Also, his character design makes him look like a pansy ass mofo.</p>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Jeff - A Whole Bunch of People from <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em></strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_ohana.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>That stupid bitch in Hanasaku Iroha with the black hair. I don&#39;t remember her name<em>, and I don&#39;t want to, but she&#39;s the one who&#39;s always telling Ohana to die, or some shit like that. That bitch is a complete, unsociable c**</em> who deserves the worst imaginable death for her treatment of Ohana(the only likeable character in that show). Allow me to be the one to fus-ro-DAH! her off the edge of a cliff and into Oblivion, where Mehrunes Dagon will enslave her for eternity!</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;m not going to leave it at that, for there are others who deserve my wrath. Ohana&#39;s mother is the second of those who have earned a death warrant, and is guilty of asshole level treatment of her own daughter. Making Ohana do the cooking from an early age, dropping her off at her evil grandmother&#39;s hotel, and finally running off to get married to some douchebag she never told Ohana about. Then she has the gall to back out of the marriage and not retrieve her daughter. What the fuck? Seriously? Ohana would be better off with a serial rapist with no interest in women under age twenty!</p>
<p>Ohana&#39;s grandmother is a nasty old hag, too. Outside of black-hair-bitch, she&#39;s the worst offender in the give-Ohana-shit-for-no-fucking-reason catagory. From day one, she didn&#39;t give two shits about her grandaughter and acted like they weren&#39;t even related. I don&#39;t care if this is Japan, I wouldn&#39;t even care if this bitch was the queen of fucking England, you do NOT treat family in such a piss poor manner(unless said member was deserving of it, which Ohana wasn&#39;t). I suppose she mellowed a teeny, tiny, infintesimal bit, but that does nothing to repair the damage she&#39;s done to Ohana.</p>
<p>Now that i think of it, I don&#39;t even know how this show even got going. It&#39;s about a bunch of people who don&#39;t give two fucks about anyone except themselves(Ohana being the exception to this) and expect Ohana to do all of the fucking work. Then they treat her like she&#39;s trash and wonder &quot;Why the fuck did she do that?&quot; when it&#39;s COMPLETELY FUCKING OBVIOUS. If I had been in Ohana&#39;s place, those douchecakes wouldn&#39;t have lasted the first fucking night. All of them would have woken the next morning to find themselves in Hell with big gashes on their necks. Then they would&#39;ve proceeded to ignore the fact that I did it and blame Ohana.</p>
<p>And don&#39;t even get me fucking started on this idea that some people purposely avoid getting into relationships with a guy so that they can let a friend, or some other jackoff get them first. That. Does. Not. Fucking. Happen.</p>
<p>Wait, that was Toradora...</p>
<p>Gawd, DAMN IT!</p>
<p><em>* - Matt&#39;s note - her name was Minko</em></p>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<p><strong>Matt - Kate Austen (<em>LOST</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
    <img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_kate.jpg" alt="Hououin Kyouma" />
</p>
<p>There are no characters I can really think of for this spot. Mellow and Near nearly (heh) ruined Death Note, but I don&#39;t not wish death on either, necessarily. So, instead, I will take from another show I finished watching this year and name Kate Austen from LOST as the character I love to hate. She&#39;s such a wishy washy bitch through out the entire show, supporting whichever male character is proving to have the biggest balls (these being Jack and Sawyer). She can&#39;t make up her own goddamn mind and is constantly ruining things for everybody on both sides. I would have voted her off the island and sentenced her to death by smoke monster somewhere in the fourth season. The only thing she has going for her is that she&#39;s hot (but not as hot as Sun or Claire...)</p>

Check back again tomorrow as we bring things to a close with the big awards ^_^</p></div></article><article><h2>2011 Best of Anime Awards</h2><time>December 28, 2011</time><div><p>It&#39;s that time of year again. That is, the end of the year and the beginning of another. As has become a normal thing for my website, I am here doing reviews of anime series I watched during the year. However, I will be changing it up a bit and instead of reviewing everything, things will be done in a categorized award fashion. Joining me again this year are my brothers Jeff and Chris. So, without further ado, let&#39;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="why-the-hell-did-i-watch-that-">Why the Hell did I Watch That?</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_wings.jpg" alt="" title="We Without Wings">
<strong>Chris - First half of the first episode of We Without Wings</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I watched the first episode of this show because I wanted to see some mad panty shots.  What did I get?  An initial two minutes of fan service that made <em>me</em> uncomfortable, followed by ten minutes of a couple of dick weeds in a bar having a boring ass conversation.</p>
<p>I will never get those twelve minutes of my life back.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_astarotte.jpg" alt="" title="Astarotte&#39;s Toy"></p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Astarotte&#39;s Toy</strong>
&quot;Astarotte&#39;s Toy&quot;, though it could be called &quot;Ass-tarotte&#39;s Toy&quot; for all the ass shots in the show. This anime has some major issues, and I&#39;m not just talking about the appeal to pedophiles.</p>
<p>The first issue is the mention in the beginning of how a succubus can pass on in full its genetic traits to its offspring, regardless of the father&#39;s race with 100% transference. If you&#39;re a male orc, and you have a child with a succubus, your child will be a succubus(don&#39;t ask me where incubi come from, because I don&#39;t know). I would take this furthur, but we&#39;ll table it for now and elaborate later. The next issue is a bit more dire. The main character, Naoya Tohara, has a daughter, Asuha Tohara. This daughter&#39;s mother is a succubus; the same succubus that gave birth to Princess Astarotte. This makes Astarotte Asuha&#39;s half-sister. Got all that? Good. Now, why in the hell is Naoya falling in love with his daughter&#39;s ten year old half sister? Asuha is at most a single year younger than Astarotte. What are the ethical implications of this outside of pedophilia? Did I mention that the queen succubus who Naoya banged to create Ashua is completely all right with it? This family is fucked up for real.</p>
<p>And now that thing I said I was going to elaborate on: Why is Asuha a normal human not a frikkin&#39; succubus? Another question not answered is what do incubi eat to survive? Too many questions, too many disturbing facts, and too much pandering to pedophiles...</p>
<p><strong>Matt - Astarotte&#39;s Toy</strong>
I actually have a handful of shows that could fit in this category, but I too must choose Astarotte&#39;s Toy. This show is so close to lolicon it&#39;s not even funny. The two main females of the show (who are supposed to be ten, btw) are either wearing skimpy clothing or think it&#39;s fun to go commando. And not to mention the <em>ahem</em> &quot;life seed&quot; that&#39;s supposed to sustain our titular character since she&#39;s a succubus (the former of the aforementioned girls). I swear to god I&#39;m not a pedophile, but I could not tell you why I watched this show in its entirety.</p>
<p>Oh, and there&#39;s a milk maid. But she doesn&#39;t get her milk from cows... her cow shaped ears and actions tell us that she <em>is</em> the cow...</p>

I&#39;d considered choosing Madoka Magica&#39;s [Connect)(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btNSYi2QMTM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btNSYi2QMTM</a>), but instead opted for Pani Poni Dash&#39; third opener. What bumps Shojou Q above is how the song is drippy with 80s goodness, from the synth stabs to the wire frames littered throughout the opening animation. This really fits in well with Pani Poni&#39;s pop culture referential, super random craziness.</p>

This song was used as the ending in one episode of Steins; Gate, but that&#39; enough to grab the award from me.  As with my choice of best opening, I have listened to this song <em>one zillion jillion times</em>.  Not possible?  This song makes it possible through pure badassery.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff - Ahita, boku wa kimi ni ai ni wuku</strong>
[youtube=3xIM-JnIB8s]
As for best ending? It comes from a show I didn&#39;t even watch, which I will not name. The name of the song is &quot;Ahita, boku wa kimi ni ai ni wuku&quot;. Again, it is impossible for me to validate this decision with words. My taste in music is largely arbitrary, so again go listen to the song if you want to know why I chose it.
I make no guarantees that you will like either of them.</p>

[<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/asQHzJYIF2A/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a>
The ender for AnoHana is actually a cover of a JPOP song from the turn of the century, but this version seems to kick the original&#39;s ass. I think part of this is due to this version being played slightly softer which really helps it punctuate the end of every episode of the show (which, arguably, ended with a lot of downers).</p>
<p>That&#39;s all for this round. Tune in again tomorrow for the next wave!</p>

All of a sudden, the song I&#39;m listening to cuts out and I hear <a href="http://dxmp.s3.amazonaws.com/songs/futurepoop.mp3">this</a>. Unfortunately, due to the design of my music listening system, my living room stereo is controllable from anywhere, hence this was made possible.</p>
<p>But, I have also written things so that I can control the playlist of any person currently using the page. So, I fired the following back at my brother:</p>

</div></article><article><h2>The Deconstruction of a Christmas Song</h2><time>December 16, 2011</time><div><p>It is that time of year again as so can be plainly seen by the appearance of Vulgar Santa on my site. So, given the spirit of the season, I shell delve into Christmas related subject. Today, I will be violently tearing apart a Christmas song (no, not the Nat King Cole one).</p>
<p>On the whole, I enjoy Christmas music. Arguably, I don&#39;t quite as much now as I did in my younger years, but it still is an important part of the season. There are, however, some songs I cannot stand. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a_Y1wAJ2MU">Christmas Shoes</a> ranks pretty high on that list, for example. And, of course, let us not forget songs about  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTNheCEUP_A#t=15s">attempted Christmas date rape</a>. Not to mention that song that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33o32C0ogVM">ISN&#39;T EVEN A FUCKING CHRISTMAS SONG!!!</a></p>
<p>Sorry, that one always hits a nerve.</p>
<p>Today, however, I will discuss <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWVU7ZbbVps">Do You Hear What I Hear?</a>. Aside from being incredibly repetitive and musically <em>blah</em>, the lyrics (when over-analysed) make about as much sense as mayonnaise taking a brisk vacation on the shores of Hawaii. So, let&#39;s begin![break]</p>
<p><strong>Said the night wind to the little lamb</strong>
Because air particles can talk and animals comprehend their mutterings. I&#39;ll let this one slide because I watch shows where <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/midori-kasugano/">humans</a> can replace <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">other humans extremities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A star passing in the night with a tail as big as a kite</strong>
Multiple things going wrong here. Firstly, stars don&#39;t have tails. Those are comets (I will also allow meteors). Secondly, should that be &quot;a tail as big as a kite&#39;s&quot; comparing the tails of both objects, or are we actually comparing the tail of the &quot;star&quot; to the body of the kite? Because kites are not that large and I am left unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy</strong>
Why the hell not? The lamb is already getting its daily news from the wind...</p>
<p><strong>With a voice as big as the sea</strong>
Another sad comparison here. You can&#39;t compare physical size with perceived volume. They are on two totally different scales. I was actually going to try and figure out what this would equate to in decibels given the size of some sea, but quit when I realized the answer would regardless blow out your eardrums. You can amazingly fix this lyric by changing out the word &quot;big&quot; for &quot;loud&quot;. Not only does it still fit the rhythm of the song, but now it makes sense!</p>
<p><strong>A child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold</strong>
You know... I can (almost) appreciate the thought here. But, how about bringing a more immediately solution... like maybe a goddamn blanket. We&#39;ve established that poor baby Jesus is freezing his buns off so, obviously, the solution is to bring him cold metal. It&#39;d be a shame if he were to <strong>die</strong> of hypothermia before he can enjoy those precious metals. Luckily, he&#39;s Jesus and will forgive your stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>The king&#39;s declaration to the &quot;people everywhere&quot;</strong>
In a nutshell, this lyric has the kind from the previous stanza declaring to his subjects that Jesus is going to save the world.</p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s think about this for a second. Wasn&#39;t Herod king at this point? Wasn&#39;t his first act upon hearing about Jesus to [b]<em>slaughter</em>[/b] all male children up to the age of two? Isn&#39;t turning this blind eye towards history the same thing as the holocaust deniers? And yet this song is not only accepted, but no doubt sang in buildings of worship. Amazing.</p>
<p>Before you get all pissed off writing a nasty comment about how I &quot;don&#39;t get it,&quot; I do understand the intention of the song. I&#39;m just a snarky asshole and that&#39;s how I roll.</p>
<p>Later, bitches :D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My Ideal First Date</h2><time>November 19, 2011</time><div><p>So, I was talking with an a college buddy of mine and he&#39;s all trying to get me to join the dating site &quot;Plenty Of Fish&quot;. I went along with it for kicks and giggles, mostly just porting over info from my OkCupid profile (which I also maintain primarily for kicks and giggles). However, one question on there set my writing mind ablaze: &quot;First date?&quot;. Now, this field was optional, but I really wanted to paint a picture for this one. Below is what I wrote:</p>
<p>[quote]A first formal date, in an ideal scenario, would pan out as such:</p>
<p>The time is 6:30. The sun is beginning to set, casting a crimson hue over the city. I gaze in the mirror to ensure everything is in order before heading down the stairs and entering my car. It&#39;s still thirty minutes early, but all has been calculated to arrive at her doorstep five minutes early given the distance and traffic for this time of day.</p>
<p>I arrive at the dwelling of my lady friend at 6:54pm, ever so slightly ahead of schedule. I take a deep breath, willing away my nervousness, step out of the car, and walk up to the door announcing my arrival by knock or door bell (if one is available). Lady friend opens the door and I comment her on how lovely she looks. We walk over to my chariot and I open the door for her, because I swing that way (pun intended).</p>
<p>Our first stop of the evening is to a mildly formal, sit down restaurant. We&#39;re not talking Chateau Le Blanc, but Fridays, Olive Garden, something in that vein. We make lighthearted conversation over the next hour and a half or so. We don&#39;t want to dawdle too long, because the movie begins at 9:15pm. I pick up the tab and we make our exit.</p>
<p>The choice of movie for the evening has been left entirely up to the lady friend. I do this because I&#39;m shooting for date number two (when I get to pick the movie/activity). As we sit there in the dark, eyes taking in the sea of colors projected before us, I might just make a move to hold her hand. No putting my arms around her or anything. This is left for stage two. The movie over, we exit the theater and once again make our way to my ride (with all it&#39;s lack of &quot;pimpin&#39;&quot;) and, as I&#39;ve done all night, I open the door for her. Chivalry isn&#39;t dead, ladies.</p>
<p>I return her to her place of dwelling and I see her to the door. I put out a couple of verbal probes to see how the evening fared. Second date and a continuation of seeing each other is my only goal, though a small peck on the cheek is most certainly welcome (nothing full on, this only the first date, people!).</p>
<p>I return to my house and reflect upon the evening. Once I&#39;m bored of that, I fire up some porn and masturbate furiously for the rest of the night. The end![/quote]</p>
<p>I can see the throng of ladies making their way for my door already...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Skype, you get my eyes of disapproval</h2><time>November 4, 2011</time><div><p>First of all, arm yourselves with knowledge: <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">ARM</a></p>
<p>So, recently, my bros have had a couple accounts hacked (one email, one Steam). Fearing that I was next in line, I started changing all my passwords using the scheme laid out above: very long passwords consisting of easy to remember normal words/phrases.</p>
<p>First, I changed my facebook password. It complained that my password was &quot;weak&quot;, but allowed me to proceed.</p>
<p>Twitter was all &quot;dude, that password is very secure&quot; and I&#39;m like &quot;hells, yes. They get it.&quot;</p>
<p>My bank limited me to 14 characters, so I said fuck it as that&#39;s the only place I use that password and my user name and banking institution would need to be known. Also, they lock my account after three failed login attempts at which point I must call. Whatever, we&#39;ll let that one slide.</p>
<p>And then we come to Skype. Now, Skype is the only program that didn&#39;t get a password change after my too-commonly used password was leaked (in md5 hash form) from one of the lulz sec releases in the spring. (Why I didn&#39;t change it, I don&#39;t know). I figured now may was well be that time.</p>
<p>So, I entered <em>skypeissomehowmuchbetterthanvoip</em> into both boxes and it gave me the green check mark of &quot;you&#39;re good&quot;. Click the submit button. </p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_length.png" alt="" title="Longer is better!"></p>
<p>Okay, I disapprove, but whatever. I&#39;ll roll with it.</p>
<p><em>skypeiskindastupid</em></p>
<p>18 characters, close enough. Green check mark, submit.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_number.png" alt="" title="Really?"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p><em>fuckyouskypefucky00</em> (hard to tell with Georgia, but those are zeroes on the end)</p>
<p>19 characters, with numbers, plenty long and certainly memorable. Again, green check, submit.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_complexity.png" alt="" title="WTF?"></p>
<p>So, let me get this straight. My old, six character, one number, one caps password is just fine and dandy, but a long string which (yes, contains words, repeating even) isn&#39;t? Really?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#39;m a trifle pissed. And as I write this, I <em><strong>still</strong></em> haven&#39;t changed that password. And I&#39;m going to email this to Skype and tell them exactly what I think of this bullshit.</p>
<p>Okay, soapbox done.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Neverending Project - Part 1</h2><time>October 12, 2011</time><div><p>I&#39;ve <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page">blogged</a> about it <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-year-of-music-now-with-interactive-graphs/">before</a>, so I&#39;ll keep the introductions short: for the last three years I&#39;ve been developing, on and off, a web based music player. The last time I talked about features was v3 and I&#39;m now two versions up from that. In today&#39;s post, I&#39;ll highlight version 4.</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/dxmpv4.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/dxmpv4.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/dxmpv4.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/dxmpv4.jpg</a> &quot;More like a sandbox than a polished product&quot;)Click for larger view...[/url]</p>
<p>As you can see, v4 was hardly polished. It fell victim to the &quot;I want to add new features but I don&#39;t want to design for it&quot; that v3 had towards the end of it&#39;s life (hint: it&#39;s the row of links towards the top). v4 was the first to go three column, based loosely off of what Microsoft was doing with the Zune player. The first column was for albums, second for whatever-the-fuck-I-wanted (songs, trending and latest in this case), and the third was the current playlist.</p>
<p>Also introduced in this version was a new extensible player module. I had tacked HTML5 capabilities onto v3 down at the end of its life, but this was the first to be built with that in mind. Also, it was the first to be able to switch output sources (here&#39;s where the modular part comes in) from HTML5 to remotely controlled VLC, which would play music out of the server itself. This could be done on the fly without having to use a separate page entirely, as had been done.</p>
<p>Finally, I had made a few things that would aid in the finding of media. Based upon recorded play data, you could get a list of media that was trending in the last seven days. Also added was a search-as-you-type function to quickly locate songs.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes there&#39;s a &quot;video&quot; tab there, but it never did anything. I had grandiose plans to merge my separate &quot;video page&quot; into this, but they never panned out.</p>
<p>Ultimately, v4 was just a testing ground for a lot of ideas that all got packaged up neatly in v5...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I am the Master of Timing</h2><time>September 1, 2011</time><div><p>So, how&#39;d you like that month of non-blogging? I didn&#39;t think I could do it, but it turned out to be not so difficult. Yay me! Now that that&#39;s out of the way, let me weave you a tale.</p>
<p>Four days a week, I eat Hot Pockets(R) for lunch (the fifth is usually Subway). I have a very specific routine:</p>
<p>1) Walk to break room
2) Grab Hot Pocket(R) and set microwave for 2 minutes
3) Leave break room and take a leak
4) Return to break room and retrieve Hot Pocket(R)</p>
<p>Mundane, yes? Nothing special happening here, right? That&#39;s where you&#39;d be wrong. By the time I return to the break room from the the bathroom, the microwave will read, WITHOUT FAIL, between 18 and 22 seconds left.</p>
<p>This routine, with all the variables (how fast I walk, how much I need to piss, people I might bump into along the way, etc), takes 1 minute and 40 seconds with an error rate of -2/+2 seconds. That&#39;s pretty damn good if you ask me.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Art Battle Redux!</h2><time>July 23, 2011</time><div><p>A few months back, my two youngest bros and myself had a little <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/art-battle-fighting-small-children-for-my-ego/">art battle</a> which I summarily won quite handily. This weekend, as I was visiting my folks, we held another one. Same premise: each person chooses a picture, all three must draw said picture to the best of their ability. All laying around my iPad, the battle began.</p>
<p>[gallery=Joe&#39;s Pick - Wind Waker Link]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_link.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_link.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_link.jpg" alt="" title="Link">Steve&#39;s Version[/img]
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_link.jpg" alt="" title="Link">My Version[/img][/gallery]
I would&#39;ve figured Joe would have this in the bag as he draws Wind Waker Link A LOT and without reference, even. But, such was not to be. As can be seen, I got a little bored waiting for everybody to finish.</p>
<p>[gallery=Steve&#39;s Pick - L from Death Note]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_l.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_l.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_l.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_l.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Now, I will go on record and say I didn&#39;t like the chosen picture much, but there it is. I&#39;d actually call this a three way tie because we all hit and miss aspects of the picture (there&#39;s something going on with the eyes on mine).</p>
<p>[gallery=Matt&#39;s Pick - Haqua from World God Only Knows]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_haqua.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Joe decided to sit this one out for whatever reason pretty much leaving me the winner by default. Both Steve and I quit prematurely because we were getting bored with the whole thing. I&#39;m just happy mine doesn&#39;t look &quot;lumpy&quot; and even Chris agreed.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Our second art battle with me, yet again, taking away the trophy. I think next time we should try not copying a source image and just toss out a subject to draw. It could very well level the playing field. All in good fun, though.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_naruto.jpg" alt="" title="A-ano?">
Hinata Hyuuga and and Gaara of Naruto fame. There were plenty of Naruto cosplayers, most not as good as the ones I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8rHf70GFg">saw at Jacon</a>, but these were okay enough to warrant a picture. And that Gaara&#39;s actually a guy. Good for him.</p>

Three various Pokemon trainers. The right one is Ash (I think) and I know the middle one is the new girl option, but I don&#39;t know much Pokemans anything. I do know, though, that when they return to their respective pokeballs, there&#39;s enough energy create to fuse oxygen and ignite the atmosphere. Cooool.</p>

Sakura from Street Fighter. Honestly, don&#39;t know much SF either, but she is wearing a school girl outfit. HAHA! I&#39;m not creepy &gt;_&gt;</p>

Captain Hammer from Dr. Horrible&#39;s Sing-a-long Blog. Something I would not have expected.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>From the Con Floor - Day 1</h2><time>July 15, 2011</time><div><p>Today was the first of our three day long anime convention that is Tokyo in Tulsa. Before you ask, I did not cosplay today. That will be for tomorrow, the largest and busiest day of the con. So far, this year has far and away kicked the pants off of TnT last year. The panels have been better so far (thank you, Todd Haberkorn; you are truly hilarious) and the fact that they acquired the convention center over the cramped hotel has made it much nicer, though it&#39;s still cramped. Good times were had and I hope tomorrow will go even better.</p>
<p>But, you want pictures. So pictures you will have. Hit them after the break.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_rebel.jpg" alt="" title="Where are your Rebel friends now?"></p>
<p>First guy to get his photo snapped was a Rebel trooper, one of those men who carelessly tossed themselves in front of Imperial fire on the Tantive IV. First time I&#39;ve seen one of these guys at a con.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_l.jpg" alt="" title="Nobody knows for sure what his name is..."></p>
<p>L, Ryuzaki or Hideki Ryuga from Death Note. Yes, it&#39;s considered the cop-out of all cosplay, but at least I can appreciate the series now.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_weegee.jpg" alt="" title="Weegee!"></p>
<p>What is with this man&#39;s grimacing look? Perhaps it&#39;s because he has spent too long living in the shadow of his shorter, fatter brother. That 1-up ain&#39;t gonna help you here, son.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day1_link.jpg" alt="" title="..."></p>
<p>It&#39;s Link as portrayed by a girl... not too uncommon, actually. Relatedly, they were selling that shield (though better made) for $60 at the vendor room.</p>

<p>This one is for my brother Steve. If you&#39;re aware of the meme, nothing more need be said.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s the report from day one. I&#39;m going to save any longer/deeper impressions I have for after the whole thing is wrapped up, but I like how things have started so far.</p>
<p>And I must hear more of Todd Haberkorn. He was pretty damned hilarious.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>How Far Does One go for Fandom?</h2><time>June 28, 2011</time><div><p>Over the last three weeks, I was finally able to experience the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in theaters. And not only that, but these were the extended versions. To say that I finally feel fulfilled as a human being would be outrageous - but it was enjoyable all the same.</p>
<p>However, last night&#39;s watching of the Return of the King was a hardship on par with the journey to Mordor to destroy the ring of evil. First of all, despite having arrived an hour early, all the good seats were already taken, so myself and the good folks whom I watched the film with were forced onto aisle seats. But this was only a mild nuisance. No, the real fun was about to begin.</p>
<p>Before each screening, Mr. Peter Jackson was there thanking me for taking advantage of this rare opportunity to watch the &quot;remastered&quot; version of the trilogy as it was meant to be seen - on the silver screen. All well and good, but a dark cloud loomed into the room when the video began stuttering. And so it began.</p>
<p>At various points through out the film this occurred, sometimes only briefly, sometimes for extended periods of ten to twenty seconds, all the while being traumatized by the audio buffer looping on itself. Due to conflicting reports, I could not decide if the movie was being microwaved in or was on a hard drive (I heard reports of both). After two hours of this agony, the movie finally gave up the ghost at the beginning of the battle of Minas Tirith. And we waited...</p>
<p>We waited a good half hour or more, with all sorts of people getting pissed off around us and not a single word from the theater themselves. Finally, a theater manager (I&#39;m assuming) waltezed in and proclaimed that they were having technical issues and we&#39;d be moved to another theater where we could finish watching the film - pending a delay to get everything set up.</p>
<p>So, we moved to a new theater  (apparently usurping a showing of X-Men: First Class) which, at the very least, was far and away more comfortable than the last. Like, I could&#39;ve taken a nap in those chairs with little effort. Which was good, because that &quot;delay&quot; turned out to be an hour or more. Just as we were approaching the &quot;okay, we give up time&quot; the film finally started up again and played without issue.</p>
<p>Generally, one goes to <em>see</em> adventures in a theater, not <em>have</em> one. Would I go through all that again just for the experience of seeing RotK on a large screen? Yeah, probably, because that&#39;s the way I roll.</p>
<p>Oh, they did give me a pass for a free ticket, so there was that. And in total, I spent seven and half hours in that theater. Almost an entire work day...</p>

Well, today I release part of that to you.</p>
<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://pastebin.com/TYfssCph">Source</a></p>
<p>The above code is pretty much a direct port of Keith Burnett&#39;s implementation <a href="http://bodmas.org/astronomy/riset.html">here</a>. Outside of porting, my only changes were some code clean up and having the timezone be calculated automatically for the longitude given. This means that you will always get back a time stamp that is local to the point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use</strong>
Moon::calculateMoonTimes(<em>month</em>, <em>day</em>, <em>year</em>, <em>latitude</em>, <em>longitude</em>);
[code=php]date_default_timezone_set(&#39;America/Chicago&#39;);
include(&#39;moon.php&#39;);
print_r(Moon::calculateMoonTimes(6, 28, 2011, 36.754478, -96.110291));[/code]</p>
<p>The above code will output the following result:</p>
<p>[code=output]stdClass Object ( [moonrise] =&gt; 1309246800 [moonset] =&gt; 1309300560 )[/code]</p>
<p>Moonrise and moonset, as stated previously, are a Unix time stamp local to the latitude and longitude given.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Alpocalypse - A Review</h2><time>June 27, 2011</time><div><p>Reviewing music isn&#39;t really my style, but Weird Al can certainly be the exception to that rule. He may not have impacted my life quite like <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/144057-hail-yankovic-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-being-weird">this guy</a>, but through all the various genre swings I&#39;ve gone through in my life, Al has always been there. He&#39;s in a very exclusive club that will get an <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/i-dont-even-know-what-to-write-about-anymore/">in-store album purchase</a> from me.</p>
<p>The reviews that follow are for the songs only. I&#39;ve not yet checked out the accompanying DVD a music videos.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/alpocalypse.jpg" alt="" title="He&#39;s still got it">
<strong>1. Perform This Way</strong>
An obvious rip on Lady Gaga and her extreme fashion. This song has been a terrible ear worm for me since I watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss_BmTGv43M">video</a> last week. Both the lyrics and music for this are pretty damn good, only problem being that the song is far too short, imo. The song sounds very, very similar to Madonna&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUDSX9vyG20">Express Yourself</a> so it&#39;s kind of funny to hear &quot;express yourself&quot; uttered during the lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>2. CNR</strong>
It&#39;s a song about Charles Nelson Reilly being some sort of super human god. Not my favorite on the album musically, but not terrible. CNR <em>was</em> pretty cool on Match Game, though, and not to mention as the voice of Mermaidman Arch-villian, the Dirty Bubble.</p>
<p><strong>3. TMZ</strong>
A parody of Taylor Swift&#39;s <em>You Belong With Me</em> (so Wikipedia tells me), <em>TMZ</em> is all about those idiot celebrity gossip shows/magazines I hate so much (even if he only mentions TMZ specifically). A few chuckle worthy moments to be had as he mentions real life celeb stupidness such as Spears shaving her head. This one&#39;s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>4. Skipper Dan</strong>
A rather depressing song about an acting genius who is stuck working a crappy amusement park ride as a tour guide. Probably all too common of a tale, the song is okay overall. This was one of a few songs he released a few years ago, so I&#39;d already heard it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Polka Face</strong>
I love Al&#39;s polkas; think they&#39;re the highlight of all his albums, so call me nerdy when the first thing I realize about this song is that, in an unprecedented move, not only does he feature <em>another</em> song by an artist who&#39;s been parodied on the album, but that song opens and closes the polka. This is not Al&#39;s strongest polka ever, seeming more repetitious than previous ventures.</p>
<p><strong>6. Craigslist</strong>
This psychedelicy sounding song about the internet&#39;s garage sale is my least favorite on the album. Every time Al screams &quot;CRAAAAAAIIGGSSSLLISSSTTTT-uh&quot;, I wince.</p>
<p><strong>7. Party in the CIA</strong>
This is your usual Al song taking some serious topic (being in the CIA doing all sorts of black ops killing and wiretapping and stuff), and turns it into a bouncy, fun little tune. A Miley Cyrus parody, this song is classic Al.</p>
<p><strong>8. Ringtone</strong>
A style parody of Queen (who is awesome), Ringtone is about some guy who has a terrible ringtone and how everybody around him cannot stand it. The opening sounds very much like <em>Don&#39;t Stop Me Now</em> and there&#39;s harmonies all over the place. The lyrics are pretty decent, too.</p>
<p><strong>9. Another Tattoo</strong>
I am not a fan of rap and its current place towards the top of the charts means that much of Al&#39;s pluckings come from this pool. This song isn&#39;t terrible, there are some melody redeeming qualities in the chorus, but I probably won&#39;t put it into playlist circulation.</p>
<p><strong>10. If That Isn&#39;t Love</strong>
If there&#39;s one person who knows how to make a screwed up love song, it&#39;s Mr. Yankovic and <em>If That Isn&#39;t Love</em>, a style parody of local band Hanson, is everything you&#39;d expect from such. It&#39;s a cheery melody about the things the guy in the song do for his girlfriend that he considers above and beyond the call of duty (like not pretending she&#39;s some one else while they make out... most of the time).</p>
<p><strong>11. Whatever You Like</strong>
This is another rap parody, made back in &#39;09 right on the heels of the economic down turn. About a penny pinching boyfriend/husband, this song was kind of funny back then, but it&#39;s mostly &quot;seent it&quot; now.</p>
<p><strong>12. Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me</strong>
This is probably my favorite song on the album, both lyrically and musically. It&#39;s yet another style parody of Meatloaf and song writer Jim Steinman, whose over the top songs are something I enjoy more than I probably realize. <em>Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me</em> is about some guy who is forever receiving forwarded internet garbage from a &quot;friend&quot;. As anyone who has ever talked to me on IM knows, I am very much the &quot;forwarder&quot; here. Though, my content is usually fresh, not three years old. Oh, internet points for including a reference to Snopes.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s my review of Al&#39;s latest. Overall, it&#39;s not as strong as in previous years and I attribute his overall seeming decline to change in the music landscape as well as age (he&#39;s over fifty now). But, even at that, the man is still a genius and can still belt out some awesome tunes.</p>

<p>My Wal-Mart experiences of late have not been of the highest caliber. Granted, one doesn&#39;t usually expect world class service at the World of Walls, but this has been exceedingly blah. Cashiers who just don&#39;t give a shit, seem to be high out of their mind or cannot comprehend the English language are what greet me at my new Wal-Mart. Though, I just left my old one, full of good people whom I mostly know, after having gotten the worst cashier yet.</p>
<p>I was there to pick up the new Weird Al album (which was not in the new releases as it should have been) and made a bee line to express lane with the shortest queue. The cashier, some teenager named Jace, was trying to open his drawer, an action that locks up the register until a CSM has approved it from their keypad. Problem number one - you don&#39;t lock up your register when there are customers waiting and you don&#39;t have to. He then proceeded to get exceedingly pissed off, swearing and smashing the clear button on his keyboard. He was honestly becoming quite violent.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand his frustration with slow CSM response and the slowness to back out of an action on the aging registers. I&#39;ve been on both sides of of that equation. However, he did unessecarily bring it upon himself and his display of frustration was absolutely not professional.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I guess this post became a rant about my Wal-Mart experience, but it still counts.</p>

<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step2.jpg" alt="" title="Much sizzling happens here">
Saute your <em>mirepoix</em> in some olive oil along with spices and other things.</p>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step3.jpg" alt="" title="MAGIC!">
Apply a healthy dose of magic. This step is critical and you mustn&#39;t get it wrong lest you create a hideous food beast.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sauce_step4.jpg" alt="" title="It&#39;s good enough to each, which is good. It is food, after all.">
Enjoy over some thin spaghetti. Not that fat stuff. Ideally, you&#39;d also have Parmesan cheese, though I sadly did not for this instance.</p>

This got me to realizing that I&#39;ve coded this particular game to some varying level to completion five times now, six if you include the yet to be written iPad version.</p>
<p>Six times. And now you&#39;ll get the code for a good many of those.</p>

My first shot for a TAttack clone didn&#39;t make it too far. It was little more of a see-if-I-could attempt. Written in Visual Basic and using GDI for graphics, there&#39;s not much to see here except how terrible it is.[break]</p>

The second version was the one for that VB game contest <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/">all those years ago</a> and arguably the most complete version to date. It had a menu, full sound, character scripting, particle effects and who knows what else. I am quite prideful in that this is a very frame accurate clone of the original game. Actually, this is probably my most complete anything to date...</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have some guy from the now defunct tetrisattack.net forums provide some graphics in an age where I sucked at such things. Of course, some of them were taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanon">Kanon</a> which I find ironic because I did not know what it was at the time and probably despised it.

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/field.png" alt="" title="Shiori had me pegged all those years ago..."></p>
<p>This too was written in VB6 (of course), but I used DirectX 8 for all the multimedia handlings. Sadly, starting with Windows Vista, all support for the DXVB libraries has been dropped and it does not work. Thanks a lot, Microsoft.</p>

My latest shot at creating this game is actually not my first using the XNA library, though it is my most complete of the two. The first XNA version was actually for the Xbox 360 shortly after I got my student, 1-year dev pass (or whatever you want to call it). There were thoughts of that this time around as well, but all has been shelved due to the whole iPad idea. I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea of making it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_project">Touhou</a> themed to get a little extra press amoungst the nerdcore. They&#39;re loose enough with their IP that I could totally do that. Ultimately, whether or not I head this direction is still undecided. And I still need to figure out how to get an Airplay SDK project set up in VS...</p>

<p>Download: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/ColorClock.zip">Source</a></p>
<p>Some time ago, a coworker passed along a link to this very nifty <a href="http://thecolourclock.co.uk/">Colour Clock</a> which displays the time and uses the values of said time to drive the background color. It&#39;s really quite pretty and nifty. Back when he linked me, there was the flash version on the site and a download for an OS X screen saver. No Windows love.</p>
<p>So, I fired up my copy of Visual Studio and set about correcting this sadness. I never really polished it to the extent I wanted, which is why I&#39;m putting it up as a source code release. There is a binary in there, but no installer or anything.</p>
<p>Also, before I created this version, I also conjured up a JavaScript one as well, which you can see <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/color_clock.html">here</a>.</p>

On the whole, I&#39;m not doing terrible. I&#39;m exercising more, I&#39;ve gotten an apartment and I promptly gave up in Final Fantasy X-2, a decision we all agree is better for my sanity. On the art front, however, things are less than stellar; I can probably count on two hands the amount of times I&#39;ve set pencil to paper to do anything. I blame it all on this one piece I&#39;ve bee &quot;working on&quot; since February.</p>
<p>After I completed that <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/dddoll-beam/">one commission</a>, I got another one similar only it involved multiple characters from a source I&#39;m not familiar with. But, in the spirit of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ganbare"><em>ganbare</em></a>, I gave it a shot. And now, four months later, it&#39;s stuck in development hell somewhere between the coloring and shading phase:</p>

<p>Bros came over this weekend, always good times to be had there. We&#39;ve been watching anime, aging games and doing tragic us amounts of asking. Probably five to six miles today alone. We visited the usual nerd places and hit up a thrift store I pursuit of cosplay items.</p>
<p>Speaking of costly, I&#39;ve gotten quite a bit farther on my costume and it&#39;s not looking terrible. The more I do is the easier it&#39;s becoming, so that&#39;s always encouraging. I would post a picture, but that would ruin the surprise or something.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been our using OkCupid again and realize why I kind of dropped it in e first ace: it&#39;s full of hyper Christians who also happen to be young, single moms. I don&#39;t mean to judge, but that seems a tad contradictory...</p>

</div></article><article><h2>In Pursuit of Deliciousness</h2><time>June 18, 2011</time><div><p>So, contrary to what one might believe, my at home eatings do not consist solely of hot pockets and ramen noodles (contrary to what my <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2011/06/matts-big-birthday-bash/">mother&#39;s blog</a> might lead you to believe). Being that I actually have culinary skills, I&#39;ve made some pretty bitchin&#39; things. There was the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-letter-to-my-dearest-mother">potato salad</a>, of course, but here are some other things that have graced my table and stomach.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/food_pancakes.jpg" alt="" title="Yumness">
I used to make a lot of pancakes in college (with various extras) because they&#39;re <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/detail.aspx">freakin&#39; easy</a> and cheap. Remembering that, relived the experience my first week in the apartment. Also decided to toss in some eggs and sausage because they are quite delicious. The eggs are a little dirty looking because I scrambled them in the sausage grease. Mmmmm......</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/food_salad.jpg" alt="" title="And it&#39;s healthy!">
A couple weeks ago, I got this crazy hankering for a good salad. Just tossed around some lettuce, tomatoes and cheese along with some deli meat I had lying around (it&#39;d have gone bad soon, anyways). It was pretty awesome, but there was actually more than I could handle over the course of several days and the rest had to be tossed. Not used to cooking small quantities, am I.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/food_turkey_balls.jpg" alt="" title="The balls are gathered. Let us summon the eternal dragon">
My supper last night. This is a dish affectionately known in my family as &quot;turkey balls&quot;. It&#39;s really nothing more than slightly browned balls of ground turkey simmered in some cream of mushroom soup and milk. I also mixed an egg and some breadcrumbs into the ground turkey. On top of rice, this is a pretty awesome meal.</p>

I was, at one point, going to film several little skits or vignettes about the untimely demise of Peeps, but really only finished one. However, for the first time ever, you can see the unfinished, unreleased opening!</p>

Fun fact: the fat kid in the commercial - my brother Chris - is very not fat now.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Dammit Jim, I&#x27;m a Programmer Not a Tailor!</h2><time>June 15, 2011</time><div><p>Sew, you are probably aware that I am going to a convention and <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/getting-fit-to-look-less-nerdy-to-look-more-nerdy-at-a-nerd-convention">cosplaying</a> this year. Using a sewing machine kindly borrowed from my sisters, I laid down the first stitches to that end today.</p>
<p>I spent the first thirty minutes battling the contraption before I decided to just google the damn thing. I eventually stumbled upon some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEvMTv2xVg">scrap book sewing how to video</a> that happened to be using mostly the same model of machine I had (same machine, different paint job).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sewing_2.jpg" alt="" title="The screwdriver was the remains of my failed battle"></p>
<p>After watching all twentyish minutes of tutorial, I was finally up and running and created a successful debug output piece.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/sewing_1.jpg" alt="" title="Fancyness"></p>
<p>With all the pre-work out of the way, I got started on one of the pieces. It turned out pretty shitty and I&#39;ve got nine more to go...</p>

</div></article><article><h2>At the Movies</h2><time>June 13, 2011</time><div><p>My apartment sits literally five minutes walking distance from a cheap, first-run theater. As such, I have made use of it quite a bit in my one month of living here. I thought, perhaps, I could give some quick thoughts on the movies I have watched there.</p>
<h2 id="thor">Thor</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_thor.jpg" alt="" title="Thor">
I know pretty much nothing about the Marvel universe (outside of what I&#39;ve seen in movies), so I went into Thor with no idea of what to expect. It has a much different tone than previous Marvel movies, a feeling I attribute to the source material being more based on Norse mythos as opposed to straight up sci-fi. It was an enjoyable film, but not near as awesome as the first Iron Man. - 7/10[break]</p>
<h2 id="pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides">Pirates of the Caribbean - On Stranger Tides</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_pirates.jpg" alt="" title="Ugh...">
It&#39;s no secret that after the first movie, the <em>Pirates</em> series began tanking. The third I watched once, a bootleg copy on a tiny computer monitor at a friend&#39;s house. I wasn&#39;t really paying attention. This movie has so much shit going on and I don&#39;t even really give a damn about it. Of course, we&#39;re never given a reason to give a damn or even much explanation of what the hell is going on that a damn should be given about. I liked Barbossa (kind of), but that Jack Sparrow shtick is getting old... - 4/10</p>
<h2 id="kung-fu-panda-2">Kung Fu Panda 2</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_panda.jpg" alt="" title="Thor">
The fact that I would really enjoyed the first Kung Fu Panda was something I had never anticipated. So, when they came around with a sequel I had much the same feelings as the first except mixed in with a &quot;aww... don&#39;t ruin what you&#39;ve done so well.&quot; Luckily, KFP2 is very much on par with the first, balancing the story, visuals and comedy quite excellently. Some of action sequences are pretty freaking amazing, too. I will say that the very, very end does seemingly kind of negate the core part of the film, but that can be overlooked. This will be my Oscar hopeful for next year&#39;s Best Animated Film category. - 9/10</p>
<h2 id="x-men-first-class">X-men: First Class</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_xmen.jpg" alt="" title="Thor">
X-men 3 sucked. Wolverine, which I just watch a couple nights ago, wasn&#39;t terrible but didn&#39;t capture the feeling of the first two. I&#39;m not entirely sure why, but I didn&#39;t even realize <em>First Class</em> was a thing until practically the day I saw it. And, surprisingly, it&#39;s really good. It has that same X-men feel of the first couple of films even while the mutants this time around are kind of wimpy (a guy who can fly by screaming? Okay, then...) Supposedly this is supposed to be a reboot, but I see it as a &quot;we&#39;re not going to acknowledge those last couple of films and try again&quot;. I mean, <em>First Class</em> opens with the exact same shots as the first film, how could it not be connected?</p>
<h2 id="super-8">Super 8</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/2011_reviews_super8.jpg" alt="" title="Thor">
Just watched this one tonight, actually, so my thoughts are fresh. Super 8 is a J.J. Abrams production with the backing of Stephen Spielberg. That&#39;s all you really need to know. Mash up Goonies and ET, both excellent films in their own right, toss in a little J.J. Abrams lens flare and monsterness and you have Super 8. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s nothing earth shattering either. Also, and I feel Michael Giacchino really phoned in his score for this film as I swear it was lifted right out of LOST. Seriously Abrams, you&#39;re not the shit so stop pretending to be.</p>
<p>So, there you are. I&#39;m sure there will be plenty more movies that I will see soon enough and perhaps force my hand on reviewing things.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The gauntlet, I have thrown it</h2><time>June 12, 2011</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/gauntlet_attack.jpg" alt="" title="Red warrior is about to die!">
So good to be back at my computer with a real keyboard and a copy of Photoshop with which to make stupid blog headers.</p>
<p>So, in my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/ipadly-thing">previous post</a>, I mentioned a particular game called SeaGlass. It is, or at least attempts to be, a Tetris Attack type clone. It&#39;s obvious that there was no love or effort put into this game and, being my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/welcome_to_the_week_of_top_5/">favorite game of all time</a>, it makes me sad inside.</p>
<p>I simply cannot stand for this.</p>
<p>So, as I am already in a heated battle with my much maligned <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/linkman2004">younger brother</a> developing just such a game, I will scrap the XNA codebase I&#39;ve spent some evenings working on and move over to the iOS platform for development. Using the <a href="http://www.airplaysdk.com/">Airplay SDK</a>, I will create a game for the App Store that is a truly worthy entry to the game series it plays homage to.</p>
<p>That and I can charge 99 cents and make a tiny profit. Really, this is me testing the mobile development world with an application I am already <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/">quite familiar with</a>. I&#39;ve been wanting to break into the arena for some time and this is where it begins.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>iPadly Thing</h2><time>June 11, 2011</time><div><p>As I sit here, hogging my little brother&#39;s bed, typing out a blog post on my own personal PADD, I realize that I do not really know what it is that I want to say. So, I shall talk about the device itself and my opinions on it seeing as I&#39;ve now owned the thing going on a week.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>
<p>There is no doubting that the iPad hardware is top quality. It is sleek and has a good, solid feel to it. The screen is bright and crisp, though it does come withe usual glare problems you will get from having a glossy screen (not to mention the fingerprints... Oh, god the fingerprints!) My only real complaint about the hardware is it&#39;s lone, mono speaker. It doesn&#39;t sound <em>bad</em>, but it doesn&#39;t have e crispness you get from two discrete aud channels.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>iOS is much nicer and easier to use on a lager screen, but in the end it is still iOS. I will list off a few apps I&#39;ve found that I feel warrant some attention (food or ill):</p>
<p>Flipboard: This is a feed reader of sorts (it will pull feeds from twitter, Facebook, google reader, etc.), but presents stories in a very newspaper-esque way. It is very clean and sexy to look at and for the price is free, probably the best iPad app I&#39;ve gotten.</p>
<p>Crunchyroll: It&#39;s to anime what Netflix instant watch is to movies. The iPhone app is good, do nit get me wrong, but it works so much bett with the exta screen real estate. Watching stuff from the comfort of my bed on the large screen is quite joyous.</p>
<p>Seaglass: This is a rather sad attempt at a Tetris Attack clone. They&#39;ve so many on the game physics messed up that it pisses me off. Yu can tell that only mild effort was put into this game and yet I paid a buck for it. Know this, Seaglass creators, you are now my enemy and my competitor. Enjoy your sit ion while you can!</p>
<p>So that&#39;s all I have. I am thoroughly enjoying this thing (especially on my home visit as I do not have to drag around the laptop) and it was totally worth the money.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I has a PhD in forgetfulology</h2><time>June 10, 2011</time><div><p>My dear sweet mother has a blog entitled <a href="http://mom28kids.com/">&quot;Oh, Crap&quot;</a> where she documents all of life&#39;s little FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU moments. Well, perfect being that I am, I experienced a couple of these recently.</p>
<p>Firstly, when I was making a certain <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/how-does-one-spend-their-25th-birthday/">video</a>, there is a shot that was taken from inside my refrigerator. Some items needed to be shuffled to make this happen and when I groggily stupored out of my room the next morning, I was greeted by a warm gallon of milk sitting out on my counter. Goddammmit!</p>
<p>Stupid moment number two came not twenty-four hours later. That night I stopped the washer so that I could take my shower. The next morning, knowing that I had washed laundry the night before, I was about to transfer the clothes in the washer to the dryer only to be greeted by a washer full of water. SHIT!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Jetzt mit noch mehr deutsche</h2><time>June 9, 2011</time><div><p>Some time ago I ran across a Spanish fandub of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/phoenix-awesom/">Phoenix Awesome</a>.

They added some extra polish that the original was lacking and I absolutely love it! So, here it is:</p>

</div></article><article><h2>How does one spend their 25th birthday?</h2><time>June 8, 2011</time><div><p>I had a few people ask me how I was going to spend my birthday this year, so I just decided to make a video of it. Enjoy!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTFL7vk-b_k"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/BTFL7vk-b_k/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>Could the naming department please step forward?</h2><time>June 7, 2011</time><div><p>All the major game dev pressers have come and gone leaving myself with with feelings of excitement and mild depression over failed predictions (more in a second). I&#39;ll go through my thoughts for each presser in the order they happened.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h2>
<p>I honestly didn&#39;t pay too much attention to this conference as I knew it&#39;d be mostly Gears 3 and Kinect stuff. However, I am excited for the Halo CE remake as I&#39;ve lost the key for my PC copy and hadn&#39;t yet finished the campaign. My only hope is that Blood Gulch is one of the maps they bring over because most all of my fond memories of Halo are in that boxed canyon. Also, Halo 4 could be cool.</p>
<h2 id="sony">Sony</h2>
<p>I&#39;m an anti-Sony fanboy and yet I watched the whole damn presser. I had a hunch that they&#39;d open with a canned apology and I was right on that. The only thing I really have to say is that I&#39;m very, very surprised that the PS Vita is launching at the price point it is. I&#39;d expected something in the $300-$400 range. Nintendo is really going to have to step it up with the DS if they want to maintain their market dominance.</p>
<h2 id="nintendo">Nintendo</h2>
<p>The showing I was most eagerly awaiting and the only one I put any predictions on. I was right on the Skyward Sword and all the 3DS stuff (including the Smash Bros announce), but dead wrong on the thing I was most adamant about: that touch screen controller. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not sold, but I wasn&#39;t sold on the dual screen of the DS either and that turned out awesome. I am ecstatic happy that the graphics have gotten the severe bump that they&#39;ve been needing and that&#39;s all I honestly hoped for. In the 3DS realm, the Mario game may very well be a system seller for me, but we shall see.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hesitant to place a &quot;winner&quot; label on anybody from an objective stand point. It&#39;s most definitely between Sony and Nintendo as Microsoft had yet another shitty showing (granted, no Skittles the tiger this year). Time will tell though.</p>
<p>P.S. Wii U? Seriously? You couldn&#39;t name it something like Ultra Nintendo Entertainment System or something?</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Gaze Into My Crystal Ball</h2><time>June 6, 2011</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/e3mas_2011.jpg" alt="" title="Looking a tad old there, Miyamoto-san"></p>
<p>E3. For gamers, it&#39;s like a second Christmas. People are giddy with anticipation and large corporations are out to get your money. And the only gift we actually receive is information. It truly is a magical time of year.</p>
<p>It&#39;s getting a tad late for Sony and Microsoft (though I was pretty damn close with Gears 3 and Kinect shit, little else), but I wanted to toss my predictions for this year&#39;s Nintendo conference up to be mocked and ridiculed by the passage of time.</p>
<p><strong>1. Zelda: Skyward Sword</strong>
This is the easy one. We&#39;ll see more video, maybe get some more insight into the story and get a release date. There may be a surprise or two as to what console it comes out for, though. My guess is we&#39;ll have another Twilight Princess scenario (i.e. current and next console simul-release).</p>
<p><strong>2. 3DS</strong>
Of course, the newly released Nintendo 3DS will get a fair amount of time in the press release. We&#39;ll get some more info on the Kid Icarus game, the Mario game that&#39;s been teased, third party titles and and I&#39;m guessing either a Zelda game (that&#39;s not OOT) or, going out on a limb, Smash Bros for 3DS.</p>
<p><strong>3. The New Console</strong>
Of course, this will be the show stealer. But, in Nintendo fashion, little will actually be said this time &#39;round (look for more info at TGS). Will it be faster and close to on par with the 360/PS3? Yeah, but they won&#39;t give us hard facts. Will there be a fancy, 6&quot; touch screen controller? I&#39;m calling bullshit on that one. Firstly, it directly competes with their existing handheld line. Secondly, the unit would become far too expensive (imagine buying four iPhones at full retail price). There will be a gimmick in there somewhere, but I can&#39;t see this one coming to fruition. We&#39;ll also be teased some visuals of games we&#39;ll never actually see, but I don&#39;t expect just a lot of details on <em>Project Cafe</em>.</p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s my predictions. Nothing earth shattering, sure, but there they are. What we find out about the new console may make or break my future in gaming. We&#39;ll see what happens tomorrow.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Sent from my iPad</h2><time>June 5, 2011</time><div><p>I&#39;d been wanting one since the first one came out, but today I finally bought a stupid iPad. The ordeal went down like this:</p>
<p><em>walks over to iPad table in Apple store like a boss</em></p>
<p>Apple dude: Hi! Can I help you?</p>
<p>Me: 16GB wifi iPads. Have any?</p>
<p>Apple chick: I have one. Black.</p>
<p>Me: It&#39;s mine!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s verbatim how it went down.</p>
<p>I am enjoying this thing, as I thought I would. My eyes particularly enjoy the very large screen. Been checking out the apps available and sighing over the apps I have that aren&#39;t iPad formatted (lookin&#39; at you, Skype).</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve been looking for options for iOS development on Windows and have a few things I&#39;m going to try. Whilst I may have caved to Apple once again for mobile computing, I refuse to use OS X in areas where I can avoid it.</p>
<p>And just as soon as somebody hacks Windows 8 for this thing, iOS is gone....</p>
<p>(no more blog posts typed on this thing...)</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Getting Fit to Look Less Nerdy to Look More Nerdy at a Nerd Convention</h2><time>June 3, 2011</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/smexy_spock.jpg" alt="" title="Ladies..."></p>
<p>Ha! Now there&#39;s a title!</p>
<p>This year my bros and I will be attending <a href="http://www.tokyointulsa.com/">Tokyo in Tulsa</a> - a local anime convention - much as we did last year. However, this year not only will we be splurging on all three days, but we&#39;ll be shedding all our inhibitions and cosplaying. Well, at the very least I will. This is my fourth con, after all.</p>
<p>In addition to the costume getup itself, I am using this as an excuse to get my sorry ass into better shape. Since I&#39;ve started my new job, I&#39;ve been spending most of my lunch breaks climbing the stairs to the top of the building, about seventeen floors. In addition, lately I have also been walking around the small park adjacent to the building after said stair climbing (about a third of a mile or so).</p>
<p>Now, however, I will be stepping it up even more. My apartment has a pretty decent exercise facility and I plan to take advantage of it. So, tonight when everybody else has gone to sleep, I and my iPhone will make a trip across to the office and I will hit the treadmills.</p>
<p>My goal is that in the month and a half until the con, I can lose <em>some</em> of the fat roll and maybe even bring myself under 200 again. Honestly, that last part wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch - couple pounds a week, really.</p>
<p>So shall it be written, so shall it be done!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Balding Truth</h2><time>June 2, 2011</time><div><p>So, I was watching a video today and the pre-roll ad was for some hair restoration product/service (don&#39;t recall which). At some point, one of the testimonials was all about how much more confidence this guy had now that he wasn&#39;t balding. And I&#39;m all like... you really rely on your hair to instill confidence? Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but I&#39;ve never understood what was so terrible about balding.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;ve always relished the thought of a receding hairline (sadly, the general consensus is that those genes passed me over). Sure, I&#39;ve always hated my hair and the fuss that must be made over it so it doesn&#39;t look stupid, but I&#39;ve always thought of bald as being both bad ass and/or dignified.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t share that mindset? Let&#39;s look at some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/patrick_stewart.jpg" alt="" title="Make it so!"></p>
<p>This guy has made his career out of being bald...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/bruce_willis.jpg" alt="" title="Yipee-ki-yay"></p>
<p>...and Mr. Willis here has proven that you can still be bad ass without hair (even if you make a shitty movie based upon a complete lack of knowledge of computers).</p>
<p>My only guess as to the negative imagery would probably be people who went bald, tried to correct it and failed:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/donald_trump.jpg" alt="" title="I demand your hair show it&#39;s birth certificate!"></p>
<p>My answer: just shave your head and stop worrying about it. Certainly don&#39;t go basing all your confidence on its existence.</p>
<p>Now, that beer belly is something different...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Unfulfilled Promises</h2><time>June 1, 2011</time><div><p>So, I have here this blog that I have so lovingly hand crafted in a glorified ASCII text editor. Some thousands of dollars of marketable man hours all of them for free, all of them for me. So, in an attempt to get my money&#39;s worth out of all my hard word, I will attempt a blog post every day in June.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have things to blog about. After all, I just moved to a new town, into my own apartment (all by my lonesome this time); my brother and I are having a bit of a game programming contest (again); more words (followed by some in parenthesis).</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I am at a loss with what to do with all this &quot;free time&quot; I have acquired. I don&#39;t have cool, awesome bros to hang out with all the time and with my huge commute gone, I&#39;ve got another couple hours added on to my day.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve got tons of shit to keep me entertained. There are games to be played, movies to be watched, things to be programmed, shit to be filmed and motion to be graphicsed. And yet, I find myself spending most of my time just surfing the internet, napping and being bored. Perhaps I&#39;m just on the slow, rising edge of the curve and will get used to it later.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the additional items that I must do in order to sustain life that I did not have to before: cooking and cleaning, primarily. I must make my own food or, if I&#39;m feeling too lazy to do that, must get unlazy enough to go and procure some from a vendor of nourishment. On the whole, I prefer to spend less money for food that will negate my feeble efforts to maintain some semblance of fitness (more on this later).</p>
<p>The most annoying part of making my own food is the fact that I must wash a variety of various instruments just to do so (this is where the cleaning comes in). All is well and good once this is done, but then said instruments must then be dirtied again. It&#39;s a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are some thoughts for today (made it with a little over an hour to spare). I&#39;ll try to conjure up some good lunchtime thoughts or perhaps code snippets to make the rest of the month more than just my mundane, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8">nichijou</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, mother. It has now been over two weeks since I opened my wings and began life on my own. All has been fine with the exception of one problem that seems to have sprung up - your dirty antics with food preparation.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#39;s right. You decided that it would be a fantastic idea to make God&#39;s gift to man, this Memorial Day weekend. And that gift was potato salad. You made it knowing full well that I would not be there to partake of the feast. You made it knowing full well that it would drag back my brothers who were having a most excellent weekend at my bachelor pad.</p>
<p>Well, despite your best attempts I am not mad. I am not bitter, sorrowful or sad. For you see, <em>Okasa</em>, I am well within the means to make my <strong>own</strong> potato salad - a potato salad hewn from the kitchen of my own sweat and tears. A march of miles to acquire the ingredients needed to concoct this wonder of man. And, even if your own salad of tubers had been constructed of motherly love, the due hardships that I had to face in brewing my own makes the deliciousness become exponentially more so.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/salad_graph.jpg" alt="" title="Math never lies"></p>
<p>So, there it is, <em>mia madre</em>. You will have to try harder in the future to tempt me with your foody ways. But, beware. This is a road difficult and wrought with many perils, perils such as a public &quot;shaming&quot; on a blog read by scant few per month. Fear what I have created!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>RE: As you leave home - A letter to my son</h2><time>May 12, 2011</time><div><p>Dear Mom (and Family),</p>
<p>You would make me read something emotional at work. I&#39;ll get you for that &gt;_&gt;. But now on to seriousness.</p>
<p>The last twenty-five years have certainly been an experience. Be it good times, bad times or anything in between, you guys have always been there and, more importantly, we&#39;ve always been together no matter the situation. I don&#39;t think I can convey just how important that has been to me, but I can certainly tell you that it has helped to shape my very core. Even just the simple act of eating together and conversing about whatever is something that I&#39;ve especially come to appreciate the last few years, something I will sorely miss.</p>
<p>The other item I specifically want to express my gratitude for is your openness. Being open about situations in the family, open about the pursuit of my passions, open about your thoughts on whatever situation I had to throw at you. I cannot tell you how important it&#39;s been to me and my development as a person to experience the world for what it is, not through some rose-colored, sheltered glasses. Has it always been easy? Fuck no, that&#39;s not how the world works! But like was said, we learn from mistakes, be it our own or others and I&#39;ve certainly learned a lot just from failing and I plan to continue to fail and learn from those failures in the future.</p>
<p>I also want to apologize myself for all the dumbass things that I&#39;ve done, both as a child and as an adult who should know better. So, for every hole I put in a wall, every object I&#39;ve thrown, every hurtful word I&#39;ve ever uttered, every bear I freed from a baby mobile: I&#39;m sorry.</p>
<p>You guys are the most kick ass family that I could possibly ever have asked for and I love all of you. I only hope that I can raise my own family to be a fraction as awesome as you all have been.</p>
<p>Rock on!</p>
<p>--

</div></article><article><h2>Art Battle - Fighting Small Children for my Ego</h2><time>April 30, 2011</time><div><p>I&#39;m moving in mid-May, apartment has been procured and packing has begun. Now that all that&#39;s out of the way, let&#39;s focus on more important things.</p>
<p>Through various happenings and goings on, two of my brothers and I challenged each other to a drawing contest of sorts. We would each choose a picture to draw and all three of us would have to draw said pictures. Over the course of three hours this afternoon we engaged in the most passive aggressive combat of all time.</p>
<p>Before I leap into the pictures themselves, a quick overview of who my challengers were. First was my 14-year-old brother Steve and second was my 11-year-old brother Joe. Was this a fair fight with me being 24? No, no it was not. Onward![break]</p>
<h2 id="round-1">Round 1</h2>
<p>Round 1 was Joe&#39;s choice of picture and he chose to do Mario; more particularly, he chose Tanookie statue Mario from Mario 3. A good, simple place to start, methought.</p>
<p>[gallery=Round 1 - Mario]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="The control picture."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]
In the end, we all came pretty close to the original.</p>
<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>
<p>Steve&#39;s picture choice for round 2 was Chiyo-chan in a cat outfit. A slight bump in difficulty that seemed thoroughly appropriate.</p>
<p>[gallery=Round 2 - Neko Choiyo-chan]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Chiyo.jpg" alt="" title="Control sample"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Chiyo.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Chiyo.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Chiyo.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]</p>
<p>This was the only round where Joe did not finish his picture first (that would be me). I think everybody did well here, catching the cuteness of the original.</p>
<h2 id="final-round">Final Round</h2>
<p>The final round was a picture of my choosing and, in keeping with the increasing difficulty trend, I chose a picture with multiple characters in it. And hands. And clothing. It&#39;s a screen from the opening of Nichijou that I&#39;d planned on drawing at some point anyways.</p>
<p>[gallery=Final Round - The Nichijou Girls]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Control sample"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]</p>
<p>As can be inferred from the extra little scribblings on Joe and Steve&#39;s pages, they were not looking forward to this one as it was far more complex. Steve even gave up after drawing character number two. Still, they both are averaging a level of decency that rivals a lot of junk I see on deviantArt, so there&#39;s that.</p>
<p>In the end, Chris was the neutral party that judged all my art the best (not to brag, but I did have a ten year head start on them). However, if I do not keep my skills up they could easily surpass me. But, it&#39;s really not about winning or losing, it was just a fun time to be had and a good way to avoid packing....</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s once again that time of year. Wait... I&#39;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>In celebration of the upcoming Easter season, I have gone and hidden an easter egg right here my little ol&#39; website. I task you, my wonderful viewers, to find this easter egg and, once you&#39;ve found it, post either a screen shot or description of the egg right here in the comments. The first person to find it just very well may get a prize of some sort (maybe an old game I don&#39;t want or a drawing or whatever).</p>
<p>SO! Put on your detective eyes and clicking things, scrutinizing pixels, inspecting source code, whatever. How will you know you&#39;ve found it? Oh, trust me. You&#39;ll know...</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like <em>less</em> progress than the [screen shots/0.jpg)](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZuAdDLlib8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZuAdDLlib8</a>]</p>
<p>A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like <em>less</em> progress than the [screen shots)(<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots">http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots</a>) I put up previously, but it does demonstrate some things that static pictures cannot: &quot;motion&quot; and audio.</p>
<p>As can be seen by that video, the graphics have quite some major problems and will be my next area of concern. However, I did get jumping between scenario files working and, in theory, the entire game is playable. After getting the graphics to a place I can live with, I plan on rolling out the public beta for people to tinker with.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>JsLive - Progress Report and Screenshots</h2><time>April 2, 2011</time><div><p>After Friday&#39;s more <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/its-like-nes-emulator-dev-all-over">technical post</a>, today I strive to show actual progress on what I&#39;ve deemed to call JsLive.</p>
<p>Today I got a basic graphics stack implemented and working, though it&#39;s riddled with its fair share of bugs and is certainly nowhere near being feature complete (environmental objects, animation, etc). However, I&#39;m having no problem running through entire scenario files having completed the first day in Kanon with no problems. But, on to the screenshots (note - the following where all taken in Chrome 12.0.712.0 dev)!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss1.jpg" alt="" title="Tell him, Nayuki!"></p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss3.jpg" alt="" title="An astute observation."></p>
<p>Because my ultimate goal is to have this working for mobile platforms, I&#39;ve been testing against my iPhone (at least until I&#39;ve got an iPad). Here&#39;s some screens:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss4.jpg" alt="" title="I even gave it a schwanky icon."></p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive_ss5.jpg" alt="" title="Lookin&#39; fine!"></p>
<p>I haven&#39;t yet implemented scaling to the device&#39;s screen size (the screen above was pinch-zoomed to the correct size).</p>
<p>I&#39;m okay with the graphics stack for the time being, so I&#39;m going to begin work on one of the last major hurdles with jumping between different scenario files. I&#39;m hoping to have an open beta up soon and hopefully get some feedback from people with various devices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s like NES emulator dev all over</h2><time>April 2, 2011</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/jslive.jpg" alt="" title="Yes, my pretties. You will soon be mine!"></p>
<p>Somewhere around the time I began working at Wal-Mart, I thought it would be a nice challenge to write an <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/one-week-anniversary/">NES emulator</a>. One of these days I&#39;ll release my mess of source code for that, but it was probably one of the most awesome programming challenges I&#39;ve ever undertaken. So, why am I waxing nostalgic about this project from nearly six years ago? (warning - there&#39;s technical programmy talk inside)[break]</p>
<p>Well, you may have garnered from <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/2010-reviews-finale/">posts past</a> that I may or may not have played visual novels of some anime shows I&#39;ve seen (I have). In particular, those would be Clannad and Kanon. I&#39;ve not fully completed either of these games because, let&#39;s face it, hunching over a computer reading gratuitous amounts of text is tiring. However, I believe the visual novel format would work well on tablet PCs. Interestingly enough, both of these games as well as most things from Key/VisualArts run on a system called <a href="http://haven.parodius.com/formats/#reallive">RealLive</a>. The actual scenario file for each game is a custom scripting language unique to the RealLive engine. My goal is to make an HTML5 based interpreter so I can make these games available to mobile platforms.</p>
<p>This is where the parallel to NES emulators come: I have to reconstruct the functions, logic, etc. that the RealLive system has in JavaScript and HTML. However, whereas emulating a 6502 is just a series of super basic functions (add the accumulator to the X register and jump if the carry flag was set), this is a whole new level of complexity. It&#39;s more akin to writing a C compiler, really. Take this for example:</p>
<p>[code=Kepago]strS[1900] += strS[1900][/code]</p>
<p>Now, in human terms this is pretty simple: add the value of strS[1900] to itself. However, getting a computer to understand this behaviour is something quite different. After a little googling, this is apparently an operation called lexical analysis. My solution is actually a two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>A PHP script parses the decompiled source code and converts the above into a JSON format like so:</li>
</ol>
<p>[code=JSON]{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;assign&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;strS[1900]&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;strS[1901]&quot;,&quot;operation&quot;:&quot;+=&quot;,&quot;ln&quot;:18487}[/code]</p>
<p>Name is what&#39;s on the left hand side of the equation, operation is the operator and value is the right hand side of the operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Now. that format was setup before I realized that true language parsing was going to be required, so at this point my JavaScript is reconstructing the original equation from those variables. It passes these off to a function called &quot;evaluateExpression&quot; which figures out what&#39;s a string, variable, function, number, operator, etc. and remaps everything so that it points to internal functions and variables. This string would then look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>[code=JavaScript]variables[&quot;strS[1900]&quot;] += variables[&quot;strS[1900]&quot;][/code]</p>
<p>This string is then run through <em>eval</em> and is parsed by JS natively (allowing me to cop out of writing the really difficult stuff).</p>
<p>So, at this point, I have most all of the branching and logic functions working correctly (as far as I&#39;m aware) in addition to the sound and music (super simple stuff). Now I&#39;m working towards getting the core graphics functions in place which should get me pretty close to a playable state.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had a programming project that&#39;s been this enjoyable and branched me off into new territory. I, for one, welcome it.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Whatever happened to children&#x27;s educational programming?</h2><time>March 25, 2011</time><div><p>I&#39;m pretty sure we can all agree that children&#39;s television nowadays pretty much sucks across the board, doubly so for anything that even tries to enter the realm of things educational. Why is it that if you&#39;re going to try to teach a kid something it has to be packaged in a brightly colored, make-the-kids-talk-to-the-TV-like-they&#39;re-actually-doing-something-and-then-proceed-to-talk-down-to-them package (Say MAP! What? I can&#39;t hear you? You gotta speak SPANISH, dipshit!). Well, I tell you what. Back in my day, we had AWESOME educational TV! Allow me a meander down memory lane...[break]</p>
<h2 id="square-one">Square One</h2>
<p>A children&#39;s variety show about math. Yes, MATH! This is a show that got Weird Al to sing about geometrical <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Iidlj5GzM">patterns</a>, had a segment using Qbert to teach positive/negative numbers and closed every episode with a parody of Dragnet called Mathnet. These guys were geniuses!</p>
<h2 id="where-in-the-world-is-carmen-san-diego">Where in the World is Carmen San Diego</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure of the exact origins of this. All I know is that my bros and I would religiously watch this geography-based game show every afternoon when I returned from school. I didn&#39;t know crap about geography (still don&#39;t), but that didn&#39;t stop me from thinking that I could place this markers better than whatever scrawny kid was doing it that day. Oh, it also had one of the most kick-ass <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdzyuJJZMCI">themes of any show ever</a>.</p>
<h2 id="beakman-s-world">Beakman&#39;s World</h2>
<p>I suppose you could call this the 90s homage to another entry on this list, but Beakman&#39;s World was my introduction to the world of science TV. Now, I&#39;ll admit that this show to a degree suffers from the dumbing down for children I was talking about above (the guy in the rat suit, the silliness factor overall and all the toilet humor), but in the end science was explained. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxr4_cccAF0">clip that seems rather timely</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mr-rogers">Mr. Rogers</h2>
<p>Now, I suppose this could be one of the weaker entries on this list, but Mr. Rogers did make frequent excursions to various places such as factories or research centers or whatever. These were the parts of the show I was most fascinated with (that and the trolley). Also, Mr. Rogers was a freakin&#39; saint on Earth, a man who truly practiced what he preached. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upm9LnuCBUM">&#39;97 Emmy award acceptance speech</a> damn near gets me choked up. Oh, and as a final note, he single handedly saved public television.</p>
<h2 id="mr-wizard-s-world">Mr. Wizard&#39;s World</h2>
<p>Finally, the coup de grace. Mr. Wizard had to be the best science show on television ever of all time. He covered everything from air pressure to atomic power to the internals of an Atari 2600. Sure, some stuff is dated by today&#39;s standards (word processors, anyone), but even now I am still fascinated by this show. I believe what really makes this work is his laid back attitude and explaining things in a manner that was understandable, but never using diminishing language. Hell, this guy was so awesome even Beakman&#39;s World, something one could consider a knock-off, named the two penguin puppets after Mr. Wizard: Don and Herbert. Rest in peace, Mr. Wizard!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll toss in a quick honorable mention to Bill Nye (the last of the big science guys), but I didn&#39;t watch his show quite as much and iirc, he delved more in science theory rather than the live demonstration of Mr. Wizard and Beakman.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been lamenting the fact that there are no good (or maybe any) science shows for kids for quite some time, but even the rest of the landscape seems to be crumbling away as seen by these gems of my childhood. All I know is that I will do my very best to subject my spawn to these great shows and hopefully they will pull away some of the inspiration and wonder that I did.</p>

<p>If you were unfortunate enough to have sat through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-top-5-list/">top 5 anime video</a>, you&#39;ll know that Clannad was pretty high up there on the list (number one, to be exact). To this day, I still consider it my favorite anime so when I wandered past a &quot;Clannad - Motion Picture&quot; DVD at Hastings, I had to rent it even though I knew it was going to be terrible.</p>
<p>I had no idea just how bad it was going to be. Ah, where to begin?[break]</p>
<p>I suppose I will start with the story. Now, I was ready to give a little bit of leeway considering they were trying to take a crap ton of source material and cram it down to a feature length film. However, they dragged through what I would consider to be the less important part of the story (everything leading up to the Founder&#39;s Day festival) and rushed through all the important things such as <strong>(SPOILER ALERT)</strong> building Tomoya and Nagisa&#39;s relationship (I suppose this was explained away by them having the same little dream thing, though the way they met seemed wholly unconvincing), their marriage, Nagisa&#39;s death/Ushio&#39;s birth, Tomoya&#39;s alienation of said child and then at the end of the movie there is a completely unconvincing reunion and the screen cuts to black. <strong>(END SPOILERS)</strong>. Everything that really made the show stand out was pretty much raped over and cast aside.</p>
<p>And speaking of cast, let us talk about how the characters received the shaft. Tomoya, Nagisa and Sunohara, our main protagonists, are mostly the same (a couple things changed here and there that were annoying but I suppose not entirely off-putting). Where the real raping happens is with the supporting cast. Nagisa&#39;s parents have been remodeled into a couple of wholly unlikable, hammy characters. Ibuki-sensei&#39;s given a &#39;tude and fighting skills and is inexplicably teaching again. Tomoyo started out as a bullying bitch and Kyou was her yesman crony. Kotomi is given a couple of cameo appearances as the conductor of the school orchestra. Finally, Tomoya&#39;s father is given a larger role where he is less of a dead beat (making Tomoya seem like more of a dick in the process). Never once are Ryou, Fuko, Miyazawa, Mei or Misae even mentioned.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand given the amount of time they had to play with not showing the entire harem. But never once mentioning in some fashion Ibuki-sensei&#39;s comatose sister and bumping off Ryou and making Kyou an only child just seems odd. I think they could&#39;ve easily tossed in a single scene with Misae and not have had it be out of place. Why they chose Kotomi for their cameo (and then botched that as well) is just beyond me. But, I will now move away from characters and pick on the visuals.</p>
<p>This movie was made by the same animation studio that brought us Dragon Ball Z.... and it shows. In a moe <em>(moh-eh)</em> show, it&#39;s important the your characters look at least somewhat cute. Toei missed the boat on this one. I wouldn&#39;t say it looks terrible, but you can tell there was a lot of corner cutting in the animation process both with poorly rendered characters and inexplicable panning still shots. To that last item, they kept doing this panned still thing where they would reset and repeat the pan at a different speed over and over that <em>really</em> got annoying. Almost as annoying as the sliding peole in Speed Racer.....</p>
<p>Finally, I want to pick on the score for the movie. Now, Clannad the game has quite an extensive soundtrack of good music for all the various moods that one is liable to encounter during the scenerio. Kyoto Animation was smart in reusing these tracks for the TV series. Toei, on the other hand, went and rescored the movie, tossing out most all of the established leitmotifs and fucking the entire thing up in the process. Music is supposed to accompany and reinforce the mood of a scene, but this stuff just misses the emotional mark again and again. Have a touching scene where somebody is recounting something kinda sad? Let&#39;s play happy, bouncy music! Ugh....</p>
<p>So that&#39;s my review of this abomination of a movie. Like I said, being a fan of the show, it was something I at least wanted to check out. One thing that I am glad of is that this was not my introduction to Clannad or I probably would&#39;ve passed on the series entirely.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Many Comma Delimited Lists Inside</h2><time>March 12, 2011</time><div><p>So, it would seem that I have already completed my first week at Winnercomm. I&#39;m currently suffering from what I can best describe as culture shock. A good many things are polar opposite from how they were at Griffin. There&#39;s no phones ringing all the time, no boss interrupting every ten minutes and also it is very, very quiet. Like, I haven&#39;t really spoken to anybody all week and it seems (from where I sit) that there are no other impromptu coworker conversations breaking out. That part I kind of miss, but the quiet certainly does lend well to productivity.</p>
<p>I cannot say, however, that I still don&#39;t find the calm a little unnerving. Seeing how I&#39;ve lived in a house with a lot of people for nearly my entire life, I&#39;ve grown accustomed to the noise that comes with it. So much so, it seems, that whereas most people would notice the abundance of noise, I am keenly aware of its absence. But it&#39;s something I&#39;d best get used to because I&#39;ll be endeavoring out on my own in just a couple of short months.</p>
<p>Yes, my own place. Something I&#39;ve daydreamed about for quite some time (and still am doing as the time draws near). Thinking about how I&#39;ll arrange things, what kind of furniture and wall adornments I&#39;d like, extra-house activities I can take part in, etc. It&#39;s certainly an exciting time, but also one that carries a bit of somber weight. Certainly, I&#39;ve done this &quot;moving away from home&quot; thing before, but last time came with a fair certainty that I would be returning for some time. This time is it. The true closing of this chapter of my life and the opening of a new one with all the experiences that will come with. Like hitting the dating scene. That will certainly bring both some interesting, awesome and probably incredibly awkward moments.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different.</p>
<p>As you may or may not be aware (which would be sad if you weren&#39;t), Japan got hit by a big ol&#39; quake yesterday. Now, usually I don&#39;t really &quot;feel&quot; much when these natural disasters strike. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m cold and heartless (or maybe I am), but things Katrina, Sri Lanka  or Haiti really only elicited an &quot;oh, well that kinda sucks&quot; feeling from me. I believe this probably stems from the fact that I have no real connection to any of these places or people (Louisiana even). But, through all the games, manga and anime I&#39;ve consumed over the last few years, I&#39;ve developed a deep respect for Japan, its people and its culture and I think that is why this disaster has touched me more than the others. That all said, my thoughts will be with these fine people as they pull themselves back together. I&#39;ve no qualm in my mind that they will do so admirably.</p>

As I was walking, I noticed somebody washing the outside windows of a building. I immediately heard an oft used phrase of my parents: &quot;Keep your face/hands off the glass, somebody has to come along and clean those.&quot; That&#39;s when it hit me: this adage doesn&#39;t really hold any water. Why?</p>
<p>Those windows are going to be washed regardless of child prints on them. The dirt and grime that accumulate from dust or the elements far outweighs in terms of amount and regularity anything my greasy kid hands could leave behind. And even if these were not a factor, these panes would be cleaned anyways just because of general routine.</p>
<p>Nice try, parental units.</p>

<p>In what was a certainly very odd week, I was finally able to return the the Hackmann homestead Friday afternoon. I&#39;ve not really explained exactly what happened during this hellish week, so I will take the time to do so now.</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> - The morning was spent shuffling my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/round-2-my-morning-in-pictures">shattered car</a> in for repairs and commencing some work from home. It was repaired by ~11:30 and I figured, hey, I can make it down to work before my lunch hour is up and get some real work done before I&#39;m snowed in for the week. However, the powers that be saw fit to keep me stranded in a hotel in downtown. Home was not forthcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> - This is where the days begin to blur together. I had to report for duty at 6am just in case something went wrong (it didn&#39;t). What followed was a long, slow twelve hours of work. Returning to the hotel I learned that the wifi wasn&#39;t working. Stuck without interwebs, I decided to head down the the bar for alcohol and food (found some scraps of internet down there, too). One $34 meal down.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> - Much the same as Tuesday. 6am, ~12 hours and no internet to greet me when I returned. I decided to skip the bar in lieu of some <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/snowpocalypse-2011-coffee-noodles">instant noodles</a> and a little &quot;film making&quot; to keep me company. Also interesting, the fire alarm went off during my evening nap. In a half awake stupor, I grabbed my effects (phone, wallet, keys) and ran out of the room without shoes or my room card, down 14 flights of stairs and into a huge as snow drift. I proceeded to make my way around the exterior of the hotel (in the snow, in my bare feed) to the entrance to inquire as to what was going on. Short answer: nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong> - Thursday was a more normal day, appearing to work at the usual 8:30am. Some other coworkers were able to make it in that day as well, so it wasn&#39;t quite as boring. Returned to the hotel where I found the internet had returned. I returned to the hotel bar again that night, again for food and alcohol. I also mingled with completed strangers for some time (one of which was female).</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> - Friday was a short day. The powers let me leave at 11:30am so I could begin my perilous journey back to the homestead. It took a little more than twice as long as usual and almost getting stuck in a snow drift at QuickTrip, but I made it.</p>
<p>So, we&#39;re now at Sunday. I have to return tomorrow plus there&#39;s the possibility of more snow this week. It&#39;d be an understatement to say that I am not looking forward to returning.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I used to enjoy the snow. My brothers and I would make giant snow forts using spare laundry detergent buckets and then spend the next several days pummeling these impenetrable <em>fortrii</em> with the meanest snowballs we could conjure up. Snow was indeed a wondrous thing, but not so much now. No, my time working at a television station has forever ruined snow for me.</p>
<p>For now &quot;snow&quot; means scrambling to ensure that systems are working correctly, driving many miles in treacherous weather or, in tonight&#39;s case, being pent up in a hotel some blocks away from my place of employ instead of at home enjoying good food and watching Death Note with my brothers.</p>
<p>One day I will no longer work at a TV station and perhaps maybe the beauty and glory that is snow will return to me. I hope so, because on the off-chance I produce offspring, I don&#39;t want to pass on this miserly attitude I&#39;ve developed over the past year.</p>

<p>Tetra: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/tetra.zip">Download</a> ]
Tetra 2: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/tetra2.zip">Download</a> ]</p>
<p>Picking up where I left off <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/make-it-open-ypngine">last time</a>, we shall progress forward with my CMS releases.</p>
<p>After realizing that the core model of YPNgine seemed broken (looking back it may not have been, but whatever), I decided to scrap the entire project and go a completely different route. When I began conceptualizing this new CMS, there were a few things that I needed to consider from the very start: security and extensibility. With that, I began working on Tetra (named after the type of fish I had at the time).[break]</p>
<p>My first goal of security as accomplished simply by writing my user and session modules first with various authentication checks made easily available. Also the idea of having the default &quot;guest&quot; user be an actual user in the database (user ID of 1) made a lot of things much simpler simpler.</p>
<p>Extensibility I accomplished by using an OOP model for what I called &quot;modules&quot; (things like message board, polls, documents, etc). Each module would require two functions that would be invoked by Tetra&#39;s core: TetraHandler and HandleRequest. TetraHandler would return various page or admin related items (page title, available navigation options, user settings forms, etc). HandleRequest did content rendering depending on the parameters passed to it which could be anything from a sidebar overview display to the main content.</p>
<p>Tetra was also completely themable, though in saying that so was YPNgine. However, whereas YPNgine used Smarty, Tetra was a solution of my own devise. I cringe to look at this code now because all of this string manipulation was written before I&#39;d learned of regular expressions, so it&#39;s bloated and slow. But it did work. In looking at the actual template syntax structure, it&#39;s apparent I borrowed a lot from XSL (especially in Tetra 2). Tying in with the themability, each theme could also have multiple styles which just controlled which stylesheets were being linked in.</p>
<p>There were two versions of Tetra, though the two are similar enough that I&#39;ve been covering them both here. The main differences between 1 and 2 was that 2 dumped all the Tetra core opbjects (database, templating, etc) into their own objects where the first was procedural style functions. Granted, these &quot;objects&quot; were static libs, but did provide some encapsulation none-the-less. Tetra 2 was also a near complete solution with an installer script, could install modules via an upload form in the CMS and had, when it worked, the ability for each user to customize the layout of the page to their liking.</p>
<p>I worked on Tetra from probably late 2003 to sometime in 2005 and was a huge part of life at that time. One of the very last things I developed for Tetra was the blog module, where this blog actually <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/my-real-blog">began</a>. Tetra is arguably the largest web anything I&#39;ve ever made both in terms of size and scope. All the source code seems to be very well commented, a habit I&#39;ve fallen out of, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made available the source code for both versions 1 and 2, the links for which can be found at the top of the page. Stay tuned as I release yet more web code, the next of which was quite unique.</p>

YPNgine: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/YPNgine.zip">Download</a></p>
<p>Sometime in 2003 I became the administrator of YPN. Not entirely sure why, but there it was. As all the other admins left, so went their involvement in the future engine of YPN, partyfish. For reasons I cannot remember, I too stopped development of partyfish even though it was near complete.</p>
<p>But, I didn&#39;t drop the idea of a new engine and leave YPN in the capable hands of sasq2 and phpBB. No, I began writing my own CMS: YPNgine. Even with just a handful of months of PHP experience, I&#39;d tasked myself to create a multi-user CMS with various levels of administration, a document library and fully functional forum that needed, at least to the users, all the functionality of the old phpBB. No small task indeed.</p>
<p>But I pounded away at it no doubt learning many, many things along the way. I even <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/ypengine-forums-broken-and-a-mysterious-mirror-or-something.html">opened</a> it up to a <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/cant-sign-up-on-ypengine.html">public</a> <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/ypngine-error.html">beta</a>, though I cannot for the life of my think of where this was hosted (somewhere on an FSF server, no doubt).</p>
<p>Going through the changelog comments I left int the source files and performing a delta against the final post on <a href="http://dxprog.com/ypn/topic/ypngines-coming-the-goose-is-getting-fat.html">this</a> thread, YPNgine took somewhere in the range of two months to develop. I do remember quite keenly when I actually turned this thing live. The first week was nothing but bug reports and security issues. They all got squashed, but in the end between the issues and the requested features, I decided that the entire model I had built YPNgine around was unsustainable, but that&#39;s a story for a different day.</p>
<p>I am actually writing this post because I am releasing all of the source code from the last &quot;build&quot; of YPNgine to the public. You can use that link at the top, or download it <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/YPNgine.zip">here</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>With the addition of search, the circle is complete</h2><time>January 22, 2011</time><div><p>Sometime in late 2002, I was welcomed on to the <a href="http://partyfish.sf.net/">partyfish</a> dev team. My first task: create the site wide search. Now, bear in mind that this was my first time really doing anything in PHP and search is quite a big thing. Ask Google. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d back me up.</p>
<p>Today, some eight years later, I have implemented site search into my website. Of course, it&#39;s running circles around my original code in terms of complexity, speed and even the amount of lines it&#39;s implemented in (340 v 70).</p>
<p>Here are some of the fun things the new search can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searches through all content types and each type can display differently in search results</li>
<li>All searches are weighted against where the terms were matched. The algorithm is such: (matches in title <em> 10) + (matched tags </em> 5) + matches in body</li>
<li>As with all aspects of my site, the search has a RESTful interface so I could make an ajaxy instant search if I so desired</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some good queries to show off what it can do:</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.com/search/rock%20band/">Rock Band</a> - Example where weighting really helps

<p>btw, if you wanted to see the old partyfish search code, <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/search.txt">here you go.</a> The new search stuff will be added to the repository shortly and I&#39;ll be making that public very soon.</p>

Sadly, my bros are now college students and, given the have homework and what have you, you&#39;re left with mostly just my reviews. But, there it is.</p>
<h2 id="angel-beats">Angel Beats</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_angel_beats.jpg" alt="" title="Angel Beats">
Angel Beats is a venture from many of the staff of Key, creators of Kanon, Air and Clannad. It follows the souls of a group of high school students who have died and are trapped in a sort of limbo, trying to find peace with their previous lives.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - I&#39;m a sucker for all things Key, so it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed Angel Beats. It has a good cast of characters and an interesting premise, with moments that can swing from plain ridiculous - any episode where they go to the Guild - to absolutely depressing - Yuri&#39;s back story comes to mind. The animation is top notch and the show has it&#39;s fair share of good songs, too (my favorite would be the closer, Brave Song). I look forward to an NA release. - <strong>8/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="air">Air</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_air.jpg" alt="" title="Air">
Adapted from the Key visual novel of the same name, Air follows the exploits of vagabond Yukito Kunisaki as he arrives in a town on his journey to find fabled &quot;girl in the sky.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Air kind of has a slow start. As with Clannad and Kanon, it attempts to touch on the storylines of all the girls, but a lot of it just doesn&#39;t seem to fit with what becomes the main storyline about half way through the series. Once that kicks in, though, the story becomes something rather unique and wholly interesting. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toradora!</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_toradora.jpg" alt="" title="Toradora!">
Taiga Aisaka and Ryuji Takasu are high school students who are to shy to confess their feelings to the ones they love. Seeing this commonality (and that each one of them is going after the other&#39;s best friend), Taiga and Ryuji band together to help each other pursue their object of affection.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Toradora! is probably the best new show I&#39;ve seen this year. It has a cast of fantastic characters (both main and supporting), a story that moves at just the right pace and manages to make you laugh while still tugging at the heart strings. The art style is something unique, being somewhat more angular than standard romcom fare, but is definitely top notch. Finally, all the opener and closer songs are freakin&#39; awesome! Oh, and lastly finally, it gets my award for best box set of the year. - <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kanon (2006)</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_kanon.jpg" alt="" title="Kanon">
Kyoto Animation&#39;s adaptation of the 90s Key visual novel, Kanon. Yuichi Aizawa has just moved in with his aunt and cousin who he&#39;s not seen in ages in a town he&#39;s not visited since childhood; only problem is, he&#39;s forgotten most of that childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Of all the girl laden anime shows I&#39;ve watched, Kanon is the only one I really consider to be a harem show, and Yuichi is a pimp daddy to be reckoned with. He bops from one girl to the next without ever looking back. This is that side effect that seems to come with translating visual novels to screen. That all said, I really enjoyed Kanon as it&#39;s just a great feel-good show that&#39;s a nice watch if you just want something mildly above fluff. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="strike-witches">Strike Witches</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_strike_witches.jpg" alt="" title="Strike Witches">
Strike Witches is set in an alternate reality sometime during World War II. An unknown alien force known as the Neuroi is wreaking havoc on the world and it&#39;s up to a squadron of young witches.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - There&#39;s no other way to say this: Strike Witches is selling itself solely on fan service. Sure, all the characters fly around shooting down aircraft and are named after famed WWII fighters, but they also never wear pants and are all young girls. This show somehow manages to cram in a panty shot where you never thought a panty shot would be possible. That said, it skirts (and crosses probably) the lolicon line many, many times. The story, while certainly unique in its setting, is only mildly engaging and ultimately forgettable. - <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="gurren-lagann">Gurren Lagann</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_gurren_lagann.jpg" alt="" title="Gurren Lagann">
<strong>Jeff</strong> - Is there a more perfect anime than &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;? No, probably not. &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; kept hitting golden notes through every episode, from the deaths of certain characters, to the changes that happen over the duration of the story. The pace is quick and satisfying, the characters are excellent, and the symbolism is downright impressive, but it doesn&#39;t stop there. This show has managed to instill in me a permanent desire to fulfill my ambitions no matter what they may be. If it fails to do the same with you, then you are doomed to be left behind as the world moves ahead with it&#39;s drill, each revolution driving it foreward to pierce the heavens. Who the hell do you think we are!? - <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<p>So, there it is. Here&#39;s looking forward to some fantastic shows in 2011!</p>

The story revolves around a young girl named Tanaka Punie who is princess of Magical Land. In order for her to become queen, however, she must become a transfer student in a Japanese high school. Crazy hi-jinks ensue.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
Unfortunately, while this show has plenty of crazy moments, nothing ever really lived up to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4i-F0gwwzs&amp;feature=related">clip that inspired me to watch it.</a> The show itself is a successor of sorts to <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">Bokusatsu Tenshi</a>, but never comes close in terms of production or entertainment value. It feels like it&#39;s trying to do the same type of thing, but just doesn&#39;t have the good writing and characters that Bokusatsu Tenshi does. - <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
I have even less to say about this. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Wow, this show is weird.  It shows an anthropomorphic potato peeling itself, which is a testament to just how weird it is.  Unfortunately, this weirdness isn&#39;t enough to make the four episode series very funny.
The first episode is great, maintaining its comic energy throughout, but once the second episode comes around it&#39;s already losing momentum.  That&#39;s not to say that the final three episodes are bad, because they do contain some genuinely funny moments, but between those moments of win it rarely becomes more than mild entertainment.
For a short series though, you could do worse. <strong>6/10</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_haruhi.jpg" alt="" title="The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - Season 2"></p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
Season 2 of Haruhi caused a lot of controversy when it came out for the middle string of episodes entitled The Endless Eight. Yes, it&#39;s pretty much the same exact episode eight times, but it didn&#39;t bother me as much as I&#39;m sure it did my brothers (eight episodes with swimsuit scenes? Hell yes! (I didn&#39;t say that…)). Both the first and last episode arcs (Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and Sigh of Haruhi respectively) offer some of what was great with the first six episodes of the first season, but it doesn&#39;t seem to captivate quite as well. Regardless, this is still an excellent entry in the series. - <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
If you&#39;re going to watch this, then allow me to make the following suggestion: Watch &quot;Endless Eight&quot; episodes 1, 4, and 8. It will be far more tolerable like that. Trust me. It wasn&#39;t quite as engrossing as the first season, either. - <strong>5/10</strong> (Dinged it because of the &quot;Endless Eight&quot;. Would&#39;ve been higher if the studio hadn&#39;t pulled that stunt. Otherwise, it could&#39;ve had a 8/10)</p>

The second season of Haruhi is good, but not great.
The Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody episode starts this season out well, working just as well as any of the first season one shot episodes.  Then you get the Endless Eight.
Now, I&#39;m not going to deny that this arc is interesting, as the concept is unique and well executed, and I can see that the creators were shooting for a certain feeling in the viewers.
But eight times.  Eight times I watched the same episode with slight changes, and that probably pissed me off.  They could have at least thrown some new events into the mix, the likes of which were alluded to but nothing done with them.  Instead, the only real changes we got were some different camera angles and Koizumi wearing a speedo.  My eyes can&#39;t unsee that.
Thankfully, that wraps up well and the following arc goes back to what we know and love from the series, helping to wash done the season as a whole.
But that <em>speedo</em>. - <strong>8/10</strong></p>

I do not like Vampires or anything Halloween related, even more so now that vampires are gay, angsty teenagers who sparkle in the sunlight. That said, the titular character of Karin is a vampire. Or rather, she&#39;s an un-vampire, injecting blood into her victims instead of the other way around. This is an interesting little romantic comedy that I didn&#39;t like initially but came to really enjoy. Througout its twenty-four episodes, it never really deviates too much from the main plot; that is, developing the relationship between Karin and her classmate Usui Kenta. The last couple of episodes are certainly intense and will leave you wondering what path the show will take. So, even with my general dislike for occultish things, Karin is worth a watch. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Re-review</strong> - After having rewatched the show and read the entire manga series, I would have to say that the manga is definitely far more fleshed out than the anime. Also, as I have been subjected to far better shows since, I will admit that the artwork and voice acting (Japanese or English) are not the greatest ever. As an addendum to Jeff&#39;s review, the show (as opposed to the manga) did have a lot of unnecessary fan service. Still, I hold by my 7 rating as it is still an entertaining show.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
This could&#39;ve also been called &quot;Big Titted Vampire Bitches.&quot; - <strong>?/10</strong> (he left no score)</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
I&#39;m having trouble sorting my thoughts on this one, but here it goes.
On the good side, Karin stays entertaining throughout, with a decent plot and some likeable characters.  One of those characters, Winner, is actually exclusive to the show and ends up being one of the greater sources of comic relief.
On the other hand, the plot doesn&#39;t follow the arguably stronger version found in the manga, shooting off relatively early on its own tangent. The art also doesn&#39;t hold up well, due to the somewhat lackluster skills of the original author, Yuna Kagesaki.
Overall though, it&#39;s a fairly solid show. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>So, there is our latest wave. Expect at least two more sets of reviews to go up in the near future.</p>

The Chinese zodiac says that this year is the year of the rabbit. Finally, reason for me to stuff a picture of Haruhi and cast sporting bunny outfits at the top of a post. But, this isn&#39;t what I&#39;m here to discuss.</p>
<p>It is indeed a new year and with new years come waves and waves of resolutions. In years prior, I openly shunned the idea of making new years resolutions. Why wait for some celestial anomoly to make changes to yourself as a person? While I still hold to this belief, I now view the changing of the calendar as a time to reflect upon/mark milestones within one&#39;s life. That said, here is my list of things I would like to accomplish in 2011.[break]</p>
<p><strong>1. Draw more.</strong> I&#39;m forever complaining about that my artistic skills are not where I&#39;d like them to be. There really is only one remedy for this and that is practice. So, I am endeavoring to draw everyday this year in hopes that I&#39;ll be less sucky by 2012.</p>
<p><strong>2. Finish all my Squeenix games.</strong> I have a shelf full of games I&#39;ve never finished, but the large majority of them are Square games. So, in 2011, I will buy no new games until I&#39;ve completed the following (in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy X-2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy XII</li>
<li>Final Fantasy XIII</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>
<li>The World Ends With You
With diligent play, I could be done with these by my brithday.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Lose the spare tire.</strong> Since my fat brother started working at Wal-mart, he is no longer the fat brother. That title now belongs to me. So, as cliche as it is, I plan to start keeping my eating in check and going on more epic walks in hopes of leveling off the old stomach line.</p>
<p><strong>4. Apartment and girlfriend.</strong> The largest and most difficult items to procure on this list. Unfortunately, the latter relies on the former and the former is solely at the mercy of my pay check which cannot support the notion of either. Without going into detail, there are plans to fix this.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s the list of things I want to do this year. Call them resolutions or whatever you wish, I&#39;m going to call it my Checklist-o-Shit-to-Do(R). Hope everybody has a happy new year or at least survives it!</p>
<p>btw - today is one of two times that the date will be not only a palindrome but also repeating this year.</p>

Any kind of original documentation that resided on Lik-sang where I oriinally released MPSS is now gone (thanks, Sony) so, I&#39;m here to provide a real tutorial as there seems to be interest for the old skinner that I didn&#39;t realize still existed. So, here is the official MP Skin Studio tutorial, brought to you by dxprog. I&#39;ll go through the entire process making a real skin as I go.[break]</p>
<p>What you&#39;ll need:
MP Skin Studio [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/docs/MPSkinStudio.zip">download</a> ]
The GIMP [ <a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/">download</a> ] (or any other imaging software that can create 256 color bitmaps). This tutorial will be written with GIMP in mind
VisualBasic runtimes [ <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=7b9ba261-7a9c-43e7-9117-f673077ffb3c&amp;displaylang=en">download</a> ] - Only needed if you get some DLL missing errors when running MP Skin Studio.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-creating-your-images">Step 1 - Creating Your Images</h2>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll need to do before even opening MPSS is to create all the images for your skin. Here&#39;s a list of everything there is to create:</p>
<p><strong>Backgrounds - 240x160</strong>
There are four different backgrounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>main</li>
<li>file</li>
<li>e-book</li>
<li>music
All background are 256 color images. More on this in a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main icons - 64x64</strong>
There are six different icons that go on the main screen. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>movie</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>picture</li>
<li>game</li>
<li>e-book</li>
<li>help/setup
These icons share the same 256 color palette as the background images. Again, more later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>File icons - 16x16</strong>
There are two small icons used for the file screen, one for directories and one for going back a level. These share the same 256 color palette as the file background.</p>
<p>So, after you&#39;ve gathered up all your images (assuming you&#39;re not creating them from scratch, which I won&#39;t be), we&#39;ll need to take them into GIMP for cropping and color reduction, which I will now explain :)</p>
<p><strong>256 colors? Palettized? What now?</strong>
For anybody who&#39;s never messed around with palettized file formats, this part will be the most annoying. Without going into too much technical detail, the GBA can only display so many colors at a given time to save on space and speed up render times. This means take our images, which could have a possible 38,400 colors and reduce them down to 256. This is where the GIMP comes in.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-simple-background">Making a Simple Background</h2>
<p>We need to take a different approach for creating backgrounds that have icons and those that don&#39;t, though if you&#39;re feeling lazy you can use this method for all of them and MPSS will do it&#39;s best to make things look all pretty. Enough preamble, let&#39;s fire up GIMP. It&#39;ll take a while to start up the first time, but with some patience you should see something like this once it&#39;s done:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_gimp.jpg</a> &quot;Kind of like this, but with less Toradora! Christmas wallpaper&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>First you&#39;ll need to crop up your background image, so click File-&gt;Open, navigate to where you&#39;ve saved the image you want and click open. It should now display in the main GIMP window. This is the image I will be using for this tutorial:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_nagisa.jpg</a> &quot;Thank you for donating your likeness, Nagisa!&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve got your image ready, it&#39;s time to crop. In the tool window, click the drop tool (or press Shift+C). You&#39;ll want to check &quot;Fixed Aspect Ration&quot; and make sure it&#39;s set to 240x160:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_crop_tool.jpg" alt="" title="Crop tool settings"></p>
<p>Select the area you want to crop your background to and press enter. Now we need to resize the image to 240x160. To do that, click Image-&gt;Scale Image using 240x160 as your size:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_resize.jpg" alt="" title="Resizing the image"></p>
<p>Now we&#39;re ready to convert this to 256 colors. Click Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Indexed. Make sure &quot;Generate optimum palette&quot; is checked and set to 256 colors. You can mess around with dithering if you like to test different results, but I usually leave it off (personal preference). Here&#39;s what the settings window should look like:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_palette.jpg" alt="" title="Reducing the colors"></p>
<p>Our image is now ready for importing into MPSS! Here is what the final product looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_final.jpg" alt="" title="All ready to go"></p>
<p>Before we can take the next step, however, we must save this. So click File-&gt;Save As. You&#39;ll want to save this as a BMP file, so select Windows BMP Bitmap from the format drop down:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_save.jpg">http://images.dxprog.com/blog/]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_save.jpg</a> &quot;Save options&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>Name your file appropriately (with a .bmp extension) and click save. You&#39;ll be nagged with a window asking if you want to save with run-length encoding. Leave this unchecked and press OK.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you can create all your backgrounds this way, but to get the icons looking all nice we&#39;ll need to go a step further. First, let&#39;s create some icons.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-icon">Creating an Icon</h2>
<p>The steps to create an icon are very similar. In fact, it&#39;s just changing a couple of values. So, here they are:</p>
<p>Cropping: set your ratio to 1:1 instead of 240:160
Scaling: Depending on which icon, you&#39;ll use 64x64 or 16x16 when scaling your image (see above reference for which icons use what size).
Transparency: If you would like an icon to have a transparent part, you&#39;ll need to select a color will be the transparent color and paint any areas you want transparent with that color (I use the pencil tool with a 1 pixel brush). I usually use an unsightly green, like so:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_ushio.jpg" alt="" title="A demonstration of transparency"></p>
<p>Done!</p>
<h2 id="making-a-background-w-icons">Making a Background w/ Icons</h2>
<p>Here is where things can get a little tedius. This step needs to be performed BEFORE you set your image to 256 colors. With your background and icons all open, start copying all of your icons to your background image on new layers. Here&#39;s how we do that. On your icon, select the entire canvas by press Ctl+A and the press Ctl+C to copy. Now, move over to your background image and press Ctl+V. Your icon should appear in the middle of the screen. We want this on a new layer, so now click the New Layer button in the layers window:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_layers.jpg" alt="" title="Click new layer after pasting"></p>
<p>Note - It doesn&#39;t matter where your icons are placed, just as long as they&#39;re there.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve gotten all your icons pasted over, reduce the colors as before. Your icons and background are now using the same palette and will look all pretty for your skin. Now we need to save out all of our images. First, start with the background. Hide all of the icon layers by click the little eyeball icon next to it in the layers window:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_visibility.jpg" alt="" title="The eyeballs turn layers on/off"></p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve hidden these, save the background image as above. Now to do all the icons. Turn all your icons back on in the layers window reversing what we did before. Now, right click on the layer with your icon and click &quot;Alpha to Selection.&quot; Click Ctl+C to copy the icon to the clipboard. Now click File-&gt;Create-&gt;From Clipboard. Your icon should show up. Sadly, the palette information isn&#39;t carried over in the copy, so you&#39;ll need to switch the mode to indexed again. Now save your icon as a BMP as before.</p>
<p>After all your icons and backgrounds have been sized, palettized and saved, we&#39;re ready to put it all together in MPSS!</p>
<h2 id="pulling-it-all-together">Pulling it all together</h2>
<p>Now that all the graphics have been prepared, we&#39;re ready to pull it all together in MP Skin Studio. So, open it up and you&#39;ll be greeted with the following screen:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_startup.jpg" alt="" title="MP Skin Studio"></p>
<p><strong>The Main Screen</strong>
Since the main screen covers most all areas of MPSS&#39; functionality, we&#39;ll start there and fill in where needed. First thing we&#39;ll do is load up our background. To do this, click the large black square in the center of the window and you will be prompted to select your background image. Pick the image you made for the main screen and it will display in the black area we just clicked:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_background.jpg" alt="" title="The background loaded"></p>
<p>Done! Now we&#39;ll load up all our icons. These are all lined up on the right side of the screen under the &quot;Icons&quot; text (surprised?). These aren&#39;t set right now, so they appear as white squares. Above each square is the name of each icon (movie, music, etc). To load an icon image, <strong>right-click</strong> the icon you want to load and select your bitmap from the resulting dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_icon.jpg" alt="" title="Icon loaded"></p>
<p>Now, as can be noted by the tell-tale ugly green color, this icon was intended to have transparency, so we need to tell MPSS that this color is supposed to be transparent. To do this, select the color dropper tool:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_dropper.jpg" alt="" title="The dropper tool"></p>
<p>Now, <strong>right-click</strong> the color you wish to be transparent on your icon. This color will now be replaced with a color checker background indicating transparency:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_transparency.jpg" alt="" title="Transparency in an icon"></p>
<p>Rinse and repeat this step for all of your icons. Note that you do not need to set an image for any icon if you wish. That said, I&#39;m going to use only the one icon for this demonstration. Now that we&#39;ve loaded all of our icons, it&#39;s time to place them on the screen. To do this, click and drag an icon to the position you&#39;d like it be on the background:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_position.jpg" alt="" title="Positioning an icon"></p>
<p>The &quot;location&quot; label underneath the background image will update with the current X and Y coordinate to allow you more precision. Again, rinse and repeat this process for all icons. Any icon you do not place will default to position 0, 0. There a couple things to note before we move on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Icon text: this allows your skin to display (or not) the captions that appear underneath the icons:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_text.jpg" alt="" title="Toggling text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bounding box: this is an editor feature. Enable this will draw a box around all of the icons to help in positioning them:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/mpss_box.jpg" alt="" title="Icon with bounding box drawn"></p>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve finished the icons, it&#39;s time to set font colors. You&#39;ll find this area in the bottom left of the window. There are three different font colors to set. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu text: this is the text that appears on the main and file screens.</li>
<li>Highlighted text: Highlighted versions of the above text items.</li>
<li>E-book/help text: Text that appears for e-books and in the help section.</li>
</ul>
<p>To set the font color, simply click the color block to the right of the item you want to change. Select your color from the color picker dialog and click OK. Done!</p>
<p><strong>Odds and Ends</strong>
All the other screens utilize what we&#39;ve just done for the main screen, but I&#39;ll run through them real quick. To switch to a different screen, click on one of the gray pills at the top that read &quot;Main&quot;, &quot;File&quot;, &quot;E-Book&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;. You&#39;ll notice that as you click through these, the background image will change. To set the background image for a screen, just click on the large box as we did above. Even though they&#39;re still displayed, there are no large icons associated with these other screens with the exception of the file icons.</p>
<p>After you&#39;ve set the &quot;File&quot; background image, you can load in your file icons. To do this, right click on the white box to the right of &quot;Folder&quot; or &quot;Back&quot; underneath &quot;File Icons&quot; and load in your icon. Setting icon transparency works the same as it does for large icons, using the dropper tool and right-clicking the color you wish to be transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Up</strong>
Once you&#39;ve gotten all your graphics loaded, positioned and such we&#39;re ready to save our skin. Click File-&gt;Save BACKIMG. Be sure to name your file BACKIMG.ext where ext can be whatever you want. If you&#39;ve chosen to leave out some backgrounds or icons you may receive a warning. Just click OK and it&#39;ll save anyways. You&#39;re now ready to put your skin onto your GBAMP or M3!</p>
<h2 id="errata">Errata</h2>
<p>During the writing of this tutorial I&#39;ve encountered more than a few bugs. As I originally wrote this software six years ago, I can&#39;t offer much in the way of support in terms of fixing them (I&#39;m missing at least one source file :(). However, I will list what I discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having the bounding box enabled prevents you from loading in a new background. Just disable it and all is good.</li>
<li>Changing an icon&#39;s transparent color more than once will result in errouneous display.</li>
<li>If you open/create a skin that has all icons and then try to save a skin that is missing some icons, the missing icons will be replaced with the ones from the previous skin. You can clear this by deleting all the files in PROGRAM_FOLDER\temp where PROGRAM_FOLDER is where you&#39;ve extracted MPSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find any other issues, please e-mail me at matt@dxprog.com. If there&#39;s enough demand, I might find my way to rewriting this piece of software, but no promises.</p>
<p>Happy skinning!</p>

Let&#39;s suspend our disbelief for a second.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for Inception</strong> - As the movie states, the dreamer must be three layers deep for Inception to work. This requirement is met if one considers each ghost of Christmas it&#39;s own layer (past, present, future). Of course, this requires a particular level of sedation. Scrooge complains of indigestion, so his food could easily have been drugged. By whom? Marley, of course. His ghostly face appeared on the knocker of Scrooge&#39;s house, so we know he&#39;d already been there.</p>
<p><strong>The time required</strong> - At the end of the story, Scrooge is surprised that the spirits managed to do everything in one night. He easily satisfies that thought with a &quot;Oh, they&#39;re spirits. They can do whatever they like.&quot; Inception tells us that a dream is several times faster than real time and each level of dream adds to that. This allows for an exponential amount of time especially as Scrooge was three layers in.</p>
<p><strong>The setup</strong> - Everything up till now is good, but here&#39;s where things get tricky. One would think that the layers of dreaming would go in the order presented in the story: past, preset, future. However, careful observation of the time each layer tells us that the opposite is true. Past takes the longest, so it has to be the last level of dream with present and future going up the chain. There is a complication that this brings: in future (first layer of dream) Scrooge remembers present and past. There are two possible explanations:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Most probable - Scrooge, upon entering the future, is immediately put to sleep. Upon entering in present, the same happens. This kicks him automatically to the third layer where everything can play out working backwards.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Scrooge is actually experiencing all three dreams at the same time, each layer&#39;s experiences adding to the previous in real time. Since the bottom layers play out much faster then the previous, all the information required would be in place for the story to play out as seen.</p>
<p><strong>Whodunnit?</strong> - Given we assume all of the above is true, who is the person that started the whole thing? Who is the architect. A simple question - Jacob Marley. He&#39;s already a ghost, let&#39;s face it, but his closeness to Scrooge puts him at an advantage to know all the key points to hit upon.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. It seems Christopher Nolan&#39;s seemingly original idea was actually conceived by literary genius Charles Dickens in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Or perhaps I just have too much time on my hands...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Collab of Reviews Part 1</h2><time>December 20, 2010</time><div><p>We are at, again, the end of another year. As I am wont to do, I watched anime again and I am here to review it for you, my fine reading populace. However, my anime watchings is not something I do alone with a bucket of Haagan Daas in hand. I watch it while downing manly drinks and filling myself with sugar in the company of a couple of my many brothers. So, this year, I&#39;m turning this series of reviews into a family affair. Since they missed out last year, we&#39;ll also be touching on some stuff I&#39;ve already reviewed. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="outlaw-star">Outlaw Star</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_outlaw_star.jpg" alt="" title="Outlaw Star">
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
Another entry in a long line of 90s space westerns. Gene Starwind and Jim Hawkings are the purveyors of a business that handles various odd jobs (think Han Solo). Through one of these jobs, they find themselves with a highly advanced spaceship which leads to many a crazy space adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
I do not have many kind words for Outlaw Star. The largest problem with this show was the plot, They set things up for something large and arcing in the first couple episodes, but then dropped it until the last two. Everything in between is useless filler that doesn&#39;t do anything for the plot or characters. Adding to that, the dub was bad and the visuals were inconsistent at best. At least it had one good closer song. <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
Don&#39;t watch this shit, dude. Most of time it&#39;s going nowhere, and when it is moving foreward, it only does so in small steps that are completely outweighed by the amount of useless drivel that serves only to bore or annoy you. <strong>-?/10</strong>. No, I do not think my score is harsh.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Outlaw Star?  More like Outhouse Stall.
I can&#39;t count how many times this show promised something more and then turned around and kicked me in the balls.  Throw in some super annoying characters and crappy character designs and you have one of the worst shows ever made, not even taking into consideration the beach episode(in a sci-fi show?) which scarred my eyes in ways razor blades and nails never could.
I&#39;ll give it a point for the accurate physics on that prison planet, though. <strong>1/10</strong>

<h2 id="k-on-">K-ON!</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_kon.jpg" alt="" title="K-ON!">
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
K-ON! follows the day to day happenings of four students at an all girl school who have formed a music club/band.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
There isn&#39;t really much to say about this show. Much like Azumanga Daioh, it&#39;s just a slice of life show that kind of, but doesn&#39;t really go anywhere. It&#39;s pretty much fluff for fluff&#39;s sake and that makes it easy to ingest. The characters, while stereotypical anime fare, are enjoyable and offer up a few chuckle worthy moments. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
&quot;K-ON!&quot; is entertaining, to say the least. And that&#39;s all I have to say on the matter. <strong>7/0</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
K-ON! is a show about cute girls in a high-school music club... and that&#39;s pretty much it.  Those looking for simple things like a plot should look elsewhere, but for those who just want a fun, light-hearted romp, this is a good choice.
While not really unique -- all of them conforming to the usual archetypes -- the characters are all likeable and work well together.  Throw in superb Kyoto Animation character designs and some good songs, and you have solid entertainment that never tries to turn serious on you.  And sometimes, that&#39;s all you need in a show. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="higurashi-no-naku-koro-ni-and-kai-">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (and Kai)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_higurashi.jpg" alt="" title="Higurashi no Naku Koro ni">
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
Keiichi Maebara moves to the remote village of Hinamizawa in the summer of 1983 when weird things begin happening. Everybody clamors on about Oyashiro&#39;s curse, but is there more afoot?</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>
Higurashi is what you get when you combine cute moe with myster/thriller. It draws a lot of parallels to my favorite episode of Next Generation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">Cause and Effect</a>). All the loops culminate with everybody dying and we&#39;re shown a few loops from multiple perspectives. Nothing is really solved until season 2, but it has a lot of great edge of your seat moments and some characters who seemed kind of obscure initially turn out to be pretty important. This show is just some really good myster/sci-fi. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
When a show begins with the gruesome murder of two girls by a crazed classmate with a baseball bat, you know shit is going to get real. And it does. Twisted and confusing at first, but wholesomely satisfying by the end, &quot;Higurashi&quot; is filled with adventure, mystery, and horror that leave you on the egde of your seat. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Given my love for shows with cute girls, this one seemed like a no brainer.  Then I found it was a horror deal, which gave me feelings of &quot;eeeeaahhg&quot;.  Then I saw the first episode and was all like, &quot;MOAR&quot;.
Higurashi may seem like an odd show on paper, with the way that it switches from light-hearted comedy fair to the much darker horror aspects.  But the creators pulled it off remarkably well, making for a show that&#39;s light fun one moment, then dark and disturbing the next.
The plot is engaging from beginnning to end, with everything starting out shrouded in mystery, but as time goes by and the questions are answered things are sown together to create an intricate story that culminates in a satisfying ending.  All of this is helped along by a large cast of likeable characters, each with intersting back stories of their own.
Overall, Higurashi is one of the best anime I&#39;ve seen, and it certainly ranks in my top shows of the year. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="trigun">Trigun</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_trigun.jpg" alt="" title="Trigun">
[b]<a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-2/#break">Matt</a>[/b]
I watched Trigun as the result of a deal with one of my many, many brothers. The stage is set on some distant planet with an old west style theme. The story is told from the perspective of a couple of girls working for an insurance claims department as they follow the world reknowned outlaw, Vash the Stampede. It feels like Trigun tries to tackle too many issues at once, attempting to be episodic while having a larger story arc. The further the show goes on, the more things fall apart, but I&#39;ll cut it some slack as the manga went into hiatus in the middle of animation. All in all, it&#39;s good but not great. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
In all honesty, I have a soft spot for the wild west. I like the idea of cowboys and outlaws, showdowns at high noon and spending time drinking in a saloon between gunfights. If you add space travel science fiction, manmade sentient biological power sources who run amok with mechanical limbs, ridiculous killing techniques, overpowered revolvers and shit and you have yourself a winner. At times lighthearted and at others completely serious, &quot;Trigun&quot; is a must watch/read in my opinion, always entertaining while still giving you something to think about. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Set on a planet far from Earth where mankind has built up into a society much like the wild west, Trigun has an appealing premise.  From the sets and the characters everything feels as though you&#39;ve stepped into nineteenth century western America.
Unfortunately, the plot isn&#39;t as well thought out as the setting.  While not bad, it takes a while to warm up, and even when it does it often times ends up dragging its feet.  By the time you&#39;ve reached the end, the plot hasn&#39;t had enough time to develop itself fully and ends up falling flat.  Combine this with lackluster animation and oftentimes awkward character designs and things aren&#39;t looking too good.
Thankfully, most of the characters are likeable, especially Vash, who is light-hearted and fun most of the time, but can be serious if necessary, although oftentimes he comes off as a pussy.
However, in the end, the show doesn&#39;t live up to it&#39;s true potential, which is truly a shame. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="azumanga-daioh">Azumanga Daioh</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_azumanga_daioh.jpg" alt="" title="Azumanga Daioh">
<strong>Matt</strong>
Watch my review of Azumanga Daioh <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-taste-of-things-to-come/">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>
Highschool girls? Check. Insane teacher? Check. Weird english speaking cat who fathered a human? Check. Implied bestiality? Double check that shit. What about a G rating(or maybe E10+)? Yeah, it gets that, too. Somehow... <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>
Azumanga Daioh is, in many ways, similar to K-ON!, with it&#39;s focus being on cute high-school girls, but ultimately excels in ways that latter does not.
While most of the characters are reminiscent of your usual anime archetypes, they  manage to set themselves apart from their peers, all of them being well-written and playing off eachother perfectly.  Tomo and Ms. Yukari spring to mind in this case, both being good characters in their own right, but soaring to new heights when playing off of other characters and giving them Hell.
With its focus on character driven comedy, Azumanga Daioh is a must see for any anime fan.  If you watch this and don&#39;t walk away smiling, you have no soul. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p>Remember, as the title suggests this is only part one. There&#39;s at least one, possible two more to come. Stay tuned!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Relaunch... again!</h2><time>December 14, 2010</time><div><p>After many, many months of development and fretting over design, I&#39;ve finally completed the latest iteration of dxprog.com! There&#39;s quite a bundle of changes in this version both under the hood and... over it? Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New look</strong> The most obvious change is, of course, the new look. I&#39;ve opted to go for a super clean look with more attention paid to the textual layout.</li>
<li><strong>Unified content model</strong> This means that items from my portfolio, artwork, videos or blog can all be displayed in the same list yet be treated differently for display. It reduces a lot of code and makes for a much nicer, streamlined presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Commenting upgrades</strong> In addition to being able to use your twitter account to sign-in, there&#39;s now the option of Facebook and anonymous. Also, comments are broken down into pages of fifty (there&#39;s <a href="http://matthackmann.net/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows">only one post</a> where you can see this in action).</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> I&#39;ve done a lot of changes to the backend structure to enhance load times. The average load time as I&#39;m writing this is well under a tenth of a second.</li>
<li><strong>Comics</strong> As much as I loathe some of those comics, dxprog.com is meant to be a repository of all my work. As such, you can view the entire Digital Double archive by clicking &quot;Comics&quot; up on the top nav. I&#39;m going to work on getting the newer stuff in as I finish importing content.</li>
<li><strong>Sidebars</strong> There have been many tweaks and additions made to the various sidebars. The first I&#39;d like to point out is the &quot;Most Popular&quot; which, as the name implies, is a listing of the current most popular items on the site. Another interesting one is &quot;Last Listend To&quot; which displays the last song I&#39;ve listened to through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. Finally, the archives and tag clouds have been given some nice overhauls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these are just the noticable differences. The amount of changes in the codebase are wide sweeping and quite substantial, but will allow for a much more maintainable codebase in the future. I plan on releasing the source within the next month or so after I&#39;ve had a opportunity to watch it in the wild and fully document it. Until then, I hope you enjoy the new site. If you&#39;re having issues or have a suggestion, please feel free to leave comment!</p>

Instead, today I&#39;m going to present to you some things I&#39;ve doodled at various points while at work. Sadly, some of my more epic doodles are in a different notepad and will not be presented here today, and seeing as I&#39;m on vacation for the next week I can&#39;t just wait until Monday to write this.

</div></article><article><h2>Incriminating Evidence</h2><time>December 9, 2010</time><div><p>I do not have a strong love for my home city of Bartlesville. The citizens are a near fifty/fifty split of rich assholes and white trash (at least, that&#39;s what it seems), there are no decent places to shop and there are no good hang out spots. However, we are home to one thing of true magnificence: the <a href="http://www.bartlesvillelocomotive.org/">AT&amp;SF No. 940</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/bvl_train.jpg" alt="" title="A thing of beauty is a joy forever"></p>
<p>I&#39;ve thought that this train was the coolest thing in Bartlesville since the days I was first watching Thomas the Tank Egnine, back when it was rusting outside of a local park. A few years ago, while I was in Florida (dammit), the city moved the train to the old train station and it is now open for the public to go inside and climb all over. Truly a fantastic thing. However, it is also sad. This glorious machine, once a productive piece of history, has now been relegated to nothing more than a set piece for the town. And while this is better than rusting in a park, it&#39;s not all it could be. I have a solution for this.</p>
<p>I am going to restore and steal this train.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right. Should I ever come into a lot of money (by which I mean millions), I will fix this train up in the dead of night, move it onto the real train tracks that run adjacent and ride off into the sunset. It will be the most glorious thing of all time. A true romantic heist that you only see in the movies. Of course, it will lead to my arrest, but I can&#39;t help but think: what would the reaction be when I&#39;m charged with grand theft locomotive? What will they do with this now fully operational vehicle?</p>
<p>Of course, this is all a fantasy, but one I like to entertain often. Perhaps someday enough money will be raised to make it operational again and they can offer train rides to the tune of $10 per, but I feel that my grande heist will probably happen sooner.</p>
<p>Sleep well, sweet prince of the rails.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that time of week again! Now, <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/rise-from-your-grave-chainploder/">last week</a> I made an allusion that there wouldn&#39;t be many more new or non-VB projects. Well, this is week defies that in both that this is something pretty recent (this year) and not VB (JavaScript, in this case).</p>
<p>You are certainly well aware of the so-called <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. What most people are not aware of is that there has been a video counterpart to it for almost as long, though its development has been far slower. In its original incarnations, the video page was a way for my bros and I to watch shows across the interwebs while I was in college. Now-a-days, it acts as simple front-end for VLC running on my server. But, streaming is certainly in the plans for it yet.</p>
<p>That in mind, I had begun playing around with the webm codec when it was released for this purpose. However, one naggling issue was that a good chunk of my content is in foreign language (I&#39;ll let you guess which one) and ffmpeg is not capable of burning on subtitles. I did a little research around, but ultimately decided that I would just write my own subtitle parser on the front end player - i.e. parsing and displaying SRT formatted subtitles with JavaScript using HTML.</p>
<p>This is arguably pretty easy (the basics of the format are very human readable) and I had a working implementation within about a day. The largest hurdle was getting the timing correct and finding a display format for the font that would allow it to be readable without going old school closed captions style and blocking out the video behind (I settled on a soft yellow with a CSS3 drop shadow). There is some rudimentary support for subtitle position animation, but little else. I would love to get some of the fancier animation stuff implemented as there are many anime that script the karaoke portion of the OP/ED to nice effect.</p>
<p>You can check the subtitles test page here: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/labs/subtitles/">JavaScript Subtitles</a> ].
You&#39;ll need an HTML5 compliant browser that supports h.264 (Chrome, Safari or IE9 at this point). Also, all the source is in the one file, so just do &quot;view source&quot; in your browser and there it is.</p>
<p>Next week I promise there will be VB goodness!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>In Hopes of Winning a Free Trip to Japan</h2><time>November 21, 2010</time><div><p>Anime News Network, one of my daily internet stops, is hosting a <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/win-a-trip-to-japan-2010">art contest</a> in which the prize is a free trip to Japan. Seeing as I am planning on paying for such a trip within the next couple of years, I figured it&#39;d be worth a shot to try and get one for free. Granted, my art skills are probably nowhere near the level of the more devoted and talented frequenters of ANN, but hey. Never hurts to try. So, here&#39;s my entry for your viewing pleasure/horror.</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/#/d33c30w]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Kirino_Blog.jpg">http://dxprog.deviantart.com/#/d33c30w]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Kirino_Blog.jpg</a> &quot;Poses are a bitch to be sure.&quot;)[/url]</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Rise From Your Grave - Chainploder</h2><time>November 19, 2010</time><div><p>I was poking around my giant hard drive a couple days ago, looking at a bunch of old programming projects I&#39;d done. Some of these had some pretty cool concepts behind them but, for whatever reason, I never completed them. So, in a series of blog posts shamelessly ripping a line of dialog from Altered Beast, I will present to you some of the cooler of these projects - complete with all their original source code. Today&#39;s highlight is Chainploder.[break]</p>
<p>Chainploder is, in its essence, a blatent rip off of some game I saw on digg and then again on Facebook. This game consisted of a playing field full of bouncing circles and you had to clear a certain amount of them by starting a chain reaction from a single point. I figured this would be a pretty simple thing to code, so I got on Skype and spun up another coding challenge with my bro  (as I am wont to do). I don&#39;t recall all the details, but I don&#39;t think I spent much more than an hour working on this.</p>
<p>[flash=<a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.swf">http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.swf</a>]</p>
<p>As you can see, my weapon of choice was Flash (I was into that at the time). You may also notice that the game buggy and crappy. Granted, it&#39;s not terrible for 162 lines of code.</p>
<p>So, there is my first highlight. This is probably the most recent project of the things I will showcase later, and probably one of the only ones that won&#39;t be Visual Basic. But, I believe it&#39;s a good kick off.</p>
<p>Oh, you can get the source here: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.fla">Download</a> (Flash CS4)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Another Code Battle Royale</h2><time>November 15, 2010</time><div><p>My brother and I are programmers. This must be discreetly understood or no good will come of the story I am about to regale. Every <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-coding-compo/">once and again</a>, we&#39;ll embark on a coding competition. Last time was a game, this time a chat client. My weapon of choice was various web languages (PHP and JS for the programatic stuff) and his was C++. Arguably, I had an advantage.</p>
<p>Even though I was able to bypass the whole sockets layer, I did set a rule for myself: I could not resort to using a transactional database (i.e. MySQL). Granted, I didn&#39;t foresee any issues as I had the power of APC caching on my side. It turned out that this would be what I fought with most and, eventually, just give up on.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, despite the fact that apc_store was returning success on caching an object, it would not persist. A quick call to apc_exists immediately after the store command with the same cache key confirmed this. I went round and round with this issue. Sometimes the object would persist for one or two sessions but ultimately would up be dropped. I read somewhere that storing an array of objects could cause issues (which I was doing), so I serialized the bitch before caching. No dice.</p>
<p>In the end I said &quot;screw it&quot; and just created my own disk-based caching model. I decided to take the whole thing a little further and account for cache collisions (two instances accessing the cache at the same time) which may or may not work. The only reason I even bothered was because I have an ID variable that needs to iterate for every single chat posted and sought to avoid two scripts running simultaneously and writing an erroneous value (a point that was raised in some fashion during my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-digg-debacle/">Digg interview</a>.</p>
<p>So, two hours after the initial one we&#39;d allotted for the competition, I wound up victorious. While not glamorous, my chat client does indeed work: <a href="http://dev.dxprog.com/quickChat">Live Demo</a> - <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/quickChat.zip">Source</a></p>
<p>What of my brother&#39;s program? Well, let&#39;s just say the computers weren&#39;t talking too nice and the program kept crashing.</p>
<p>Victory is mine!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>The Revenge of Bottomembly</h2><time>October 14, 2010</time><div><p>A few days ago I was out walking and reminiscing, as I am wont to do. While I was doing this, I  recalled some of my first web related programming projects, most notably YPNgine. Considering it was my first major PHP outing, I pulled off quite a feat. Writing a message board is no small task. However, there was one part in particular that I was mulling over: the censor. </p>
<p>If you happen to be a former YPNer, you may recall seeing many references to &quot;bottomembly&quot;. Carrying over the censor find/replace list that had been used on phpBB before it, all instances of the character sequence &quot;ass&quot; were summarily replaced with &quot;bottom&quot;. Now I am being very choosy when I say &quot;character sequence&quot; and not &quot;word&quot; as the censor couldn&#39;t differentiate words.</p>
<p>This oversight was brought to my attention my young programmer self struggled to figure out a solution. Here&#39;s what I wound up doing:</p>
<p>[code=php]// Copyright (c) 2003 Matt Hackmann
// Full copyright info in index.php</p>
<p>function censor_post ($body)
{</p>
<pre><code>$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bannedwords&quot;;
$result = db_Query ($query);

$body = &quot; &quot;.$body;

$body = str_ireplace (&quot;assembly&quot;, &quot;ytrewq&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;assum&quot;, &quot;asd;ljf&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;glass&quot;, &quot;glss&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hllo&quot;, $body);

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; db_num_Rows ($result); $i++) {
    $row = db_fetch_array ($result);
    $body = str_ireplace ($row[&quot;blocked_word&quot;], &quot;&quot;, $body);
}

if ($body == &quot; &quot;)
    $body = &quot;Censored&quot;;

$body = str_replace (&quot;asd;ljf&quot;, &quot;assum&quot;, $body);
$body = str_replace (&quot;ytrewq&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;, $body);
$body = str_replace (&quot;glss&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, $body);
$body = str_ireplace (&quot;hllo&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, $body);

return $body;
</code></pre><p>}[/code]</p>
<p>As you can see, I started hard coding in a list of safe words, replacing those instances with a random (or not so random) string of characters, run the censor and then convert those strings back to the safe words. This was a list I kept expanding on as they were found during normal conversation on the forum. I giggle as I look at this list and think of what the censor was doing to those words: bottomume, glbottom and hecko.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just something that I, eight years later, have to look back on and chuckle about.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Could this be... progress?</h2><time>October 10, 2010</time><div><p>Some moons ago, I had a little comic entitled <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/">Digital Double</a>. It was terrible, but I found myself reading through it again one day not too long ago for whatever reason. One comic in particular intrigued me as I was attempting to <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54170/anime-tracy/">take a stab</a> at &quot;anime style&quot;, an in joke to a couple of sudden character design changes I&#39;d made. Here is the panel in question:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Kate2006.jpg" alt="" title="Kate circa 2006"></p>
<p>Now, one thing that intrigues me about this picture is that, at the time, I absolutely despised anime and all arts Japanese. That being said, I do not remember using much of anything as far as reference to even attempt to match the style. Just slap on some large, shiny eyes and a pleated skirt. DONE!</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to revisit this frame and, given that I am actually attempting to draw in this style seriously, envision it as it should have been.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Kate2010.jpg" alt="" title="What it should have been"></p>
<p>I did take a couple of artistic liberties, changing hair, clothing and pose, but it&#39;s kind of nice to see that in the four years since I drew the original picture my drawing skills have made some headway. Quite a lot, actually. Granted it&#39;s not perfect, and I&#39;ve a long ways to go, but the feeling is comforting nonetheless.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Profile Pics - The Story of One Man&#x27;s Beard</h2><time>October 9, 2010</time><div><p>I recently decided that it was time to update my profile picture across the various sites I frequent. This is something I do, on average, every 6-8 months or more (I didn&#39;t really bother to calculate the actual average). Looking through my past profile pics on Facebook, I noticed something interesting: they convey a visual history of my beard. My beard is certainly deserving of its own blog post, so I will regale its tale here for the masses!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007a.jpg" alt="" title="Circa April 2007">
<strong>April 2007</strong> - A couple of straggling hairs, but otherwise nothing. My hand does not deserve to be stroking a smooth chin.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007b.jpg" alt="" title="Circa May 2007">
<strong>May 2007</strong> - At this point, there&#39;s enough hairs that I could probably have cosplayed as <a href="http://aceattorney.wikia.com/wiki/Gumshoe">Detective Gumshoe</a> quite easily.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007c.jpg" alt="" title="Circa October 2007">
<strong>October 2007</strong> - Okay, let&#39;s face it. 2007 was a crappy year for the beard.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2008.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2008">
<strong>October 2008</strong> - While certainly not filled out, the beard was finally showing some promise of being EPIC. Interesting side note - I had to Photoshop that smirk onto my face</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2009.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2009">
<strong>May 2009</strong> - Two years later, the beard is finally respectable enough that it can be stroked in deep thought and look awesome.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2010.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2010">
<strong>October 2010</strong> - After 24 years of beard growing, I think it&#39;s finally gotten to the &quot;You don&#39;t want to fuck with me&quot; status. The shades help.</p>
<p>Some other interesting things to notice in these pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>My face is almost always pointed away from the camera</li>
<li>I get fatter as time goes on</li>
</ul>

</div></article><article><h2>Wordpress - Related Posts Script</h2><time>September 13, 2010</time><div><p>At my job, I currently have three Wordpress sites under my watchful eye. On one, I was tasked with creating a related posts feature. Now, there are certainly enough plug-ins that will do just that, but none of them worked how I wanted to or were generally more complex than necessary. So, I whipped up this little script:</p>
<p>[code=php]function relatedPosts($id) {</p>
<pre><code>/* Build a query to get a list of all posts that share similar tags */
$s = microtime(true);
$q = &quot;SELECT count(*) AS total, p.ID, p.post_title, p.post_date FROM wp_posts p INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships t ON p.ID=t.object_id AND t.term_taxonomy_id in (SELECT s.term_taxonomy_id FROM wp_term_relationships s WHERE s.object_id=$id) AND t.object_id != $id AND p.post_status=&#39;publish&#39; GROUP BY p.id ORDER BY total DESC, p.post_date DESC LIMIT 5&quot;;

/* Format the output */
$out = &quot;&quot;;
$result = @mysql_query($q);
if ($result &amp;&amp; @mysql_num_rows($result) &gt; 0) {
    $out = &quot;&lt;h3 class=\&quot;related\&quot;&gt;Related Posts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\&quot;related\&quot;&gt;&quot;;
    while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)) {
        $perma = get_permalink($row-&gt;ID);
        $out .= &#39;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39;.$perma.&#39;&quot;&gt;&#39;.$row-&gt;post_title.&#39;&lt;/a&gt; - &#39;.date(&quot;F j, Y&quot;, strtotime($row-&gt;post_date)).&#39;&lt;/li&gt;&#39;;
    }
    $out .= &quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;;
}

echo($out);
</code></pre><p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Just drop that in the wp-content/<em>yourtheme</em>/functions.php file, where <em>yourtheme</em> is the directory of your active theme. Then add the following in your wp-content/<em>yourtheme</em>/single.php where you want the related posts to appear:</p>
<p>[code=php]relatedPosts(get_the_ID());[/code]</p>
<p>You should now have a list of posts with similar tags. Styling is simple: one h3 and one ul, both with the class &quot;related&quot;.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Because it Provided Ample Opportunity for Practice</h2><time>September 12, 2010</time><div><p>I&#39;ve done some odd things to other people&#39;s work for my own pleasure. Editing parts I don&#39;t like out of songs comes to mind (I&#39;ve done this on more than one occasion). However, the latest target of my artistic raping is the live action video for Ningyo Hime, the Chobits closer and a song I much enjoy. While I do enjoy Japan&#39;s animated fare quite a lot, I am of the mind that they really suck at live action. The video of this song suffers from a lack of vision and direction, but more importantly it looks like it was shot on an old Sony HandyCam. I sought to &quot;correct&quot; this issue by using it as practice for color correction. After dropping the frame rate to 24 - down from a too smooth looking 29.97 - and slaughtering the blue color channel, this is what came out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUA322rLi0M"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/eUA322rLi0M/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>This is What I Think About Whilst Driving to Work</h2><time>September 10, 2010</time><div><p>On my daily commute to work I encounter three intersections (four if you include that weird three way, round the corner thing). Of these intersections, two have lights. One of these is at the cross roads of a highway, with light poles hanging out over the streets on all four corners. The other one... well, it&#39;s messed up.</p>
<p>This intersection, being comprised of two smaller roads, has two lights dangling over a singular wire running diagonally across the streets.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/streets1.png" alt="" title="Fig. 1"></p>
<p>This is all well and good, but if you happen to be stopped heading east/westbound (as denoted here by the green lights - illogical on two counts now that I think about it), you find yourself an annoying predicament.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/streets2.png" alt="" title="Fig. 2"></p>
<p>The yellow cone represents one&#39;s field of vision. As you can see, the driver of this fancy white car is completely unable to see the light. He would have to hunch down and angle his neck upward at an uncomfortable angle to correct this problem. This can be made doubly worse if the driver is A) tall or B) driving in a tall vehicle. I myself have met both conditions in the past.</p>
<p>You might be looking at that diagram and be thinking to yourself &quot;Okay, there are two lights. Just use the one farther away.&quot; Which would be great, except it&#39;s positioned just so that it is obstructed by the upper left corner of the car.</p>
<p>There is a solution that could not only solve our issue but come with another small perk as well:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/streets3.png" alt="" title="Fig. 3"></p>
<p>By placing a single light over the center of the road, all drivers now have an equally decent view and there&#39;s the added bonus that you are now drawing half the amount of power than before.</p>
<p>So, City of Bartlesville street planners, take my logically thought out rant to heart and save my poor neck from this treacherous evil I must face every morning. And if I find out you all have shares in local chiropractors and this was all on purpose, then may you forever sit at a red light in the westbound lane of Price and Silver Lake down in Hell!</p>

The graph has been sitting there up at the top of my blog page slowly counting up to the grand total of 750,000. And today, one week before deadline, I have hit that total. This little exercise has added quite a bit to my life, from friendly competition with co-workers to some much needed think time. Now, to celebrate this achievement, I give you some more photos of my journeys.[break]</p>
<h2 id="signs">Signs</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of sign stuff already, but these are things I decided didn&#39;t deserve an entire rant.

<p>On one of my usual trails, there is a tunnel underneath a major city street. This single tunnel is home to quite a bit of interesting (and disturbing) grafitti.

This whole Facebook debacle has nary phased me as the whole point I post things on there is for selfless promotion and narcissistic reasons. I want people to read those things.

<p>Sometimes during conversations, something interesting will be said that sets me off on a journey to Photoshop to concoct a visual representation of said mutterings. The fruits of these labors are interesting indeed and I present them here for your enjoyment.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Peace, Quiet and Solitude</h2><time>June 15, 2010</time><div><p>I am in the realizing that it&#39;s been nearly a month since I last blogged anything, granted this comes on the heels of an unusually active period for me. But, hey. Nothing terribly exciting has happened, so there it is.</p>
<p>I decided that last week would be a pretty good week to blow a whole bunch of my paid vacation time... after all, the best day of the year happened to fall in that week (hint: my birthday). It was nice to just forget about the world around me and piddle around quietly the way I used to back in the days when I was <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/pretty-pictures-abound/">without work.</a> I churned out no less than three distinct (but wholly unfinished) projects.</p>
<p>The first of these is a UX re-imagining for my ongoing project, the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. Now that I am a far better JavaScript guru than I was when this was originally written, I&#39;ve decided to take a completely different approach in terms of user presentation (though, the underlying functionality is pretty much the same).</p>
<p>Another thing I did was start in on learning some more HTML5 canvas stuffs, as it provides a pretty sweet opportunity for gaming purposes. I started messing around with coding a simple <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/gameEngine/">drawing framework</a> and, at the behest of my <a href="http://square-headed.com/entry/announcing-the-official-launch-of-3dview/">osu! fanatical brother</a>, began attempting a <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/eba_html5/">clone of sorts for that</a>. Ultimately, I made some good progress and the canvas object is certainly a powerful tool, but there are some simple things that it simply can&#39;t do that keeps Flash at the advantage (I&#39;m looking at you, per blit alpha).</p>
<p>Other than these few programming things and a goodly amount of time with my nose in books, it was a slothful week to be sure. But, then again, that&#39;s the whole point of &quot;vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>Tune in this weekend as I head to yet another anime con.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s Naturiffic!</h2><time>May 11, 2010</time><div><p>Punny titles aside, I have made <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/more-billboard-fun/">more</a> than <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/walking-for-cash/">one</a> <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/parental-pimps/">allusion</a> to my walking sessions. Currently my graph is telling me that I had a pretty crappy week last week, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re here to discuss.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bartlesvilleparks.com/Pages/pathfinder1.html">Pathfinder Parkway</a> has been my preferred walking path of choice for the weekends as it removes me from all the loud roads and reminds me of the lengthy walks I took to the bank in Winter Park via the <a href="http://www.dep.state.fl.us/gwt/guide/regions/eastcentral/trails/cadyway.htm">Cady Way Trail</a>. The Pathfinder runs right along the Caney River, Bartlesville&#39;s local body of poisoned water, but it does provide that &quot;nature&quot; feel. But, I could throw words at you all day and not get the point across, so queue up the photo gallery!</p>
<p>[gallery=Pathfinder Parkway]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_path.jpg" alt="" title="A shot of the path itself, all shrouded in foresty glory"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_bridge.jpg" alt="" title="The footbridge that crosses the Caney. Its iron/wood construction gives it a rustic quaint feel, I think, and adds to the experience of walking the trail"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_pump.jpg" alt="" title="An old abandoned oil pump. This is just one of many, but hey, it&#39;s Oklahoma so it&#39;s to be expected, right? I&#39;ll admit, though, it&#39;s kind of eerie walking right up alongside these things out in the middle of nowhere with their ominous whir and the wonderful stench of unearthed oil."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_tanks.jpg" alt="" title="Of course, where there are oil pumps, there will be storage tanks. But, damn, are they dilapidated."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_car.jpg" alt="" title="Wait...? What? A car?

It&#39;s Terrance from Thomas the Tank Engine! OMG OMG OM.... WTF?!!">[/gallery]</p>
<p>Okay, so it has it&#39;s downsides. Arguably the most annoying part is the dozen or so oil pumps, but it&#39;s amazing the crap I&#39;ve spotted along this trail. I will, perhaps, update again with more pictures later as these just barely scratch the surface.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>More Billboard Fun</h2><time>May 3, 2010</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/monopoly_billboard.jpg" alt="" title="Hell - A tiny ass hole in the ground"></p>
<p>I was on another one of my afternoon walks, shooting to get in my 10,000 steps for the day, when I ran into yet another billboard that struck me an odd way. As can be seen above, it depicts Mr. Monopoly jumping out of Hell, presumably after having used his &quot;Get Out of Hell Free&quot; card. Their illegal use of the Hasbro icon notwithstanding, this brings up some interesting notions.</p>
<p>The sign insinuates that you&#39;ve already BEEN to Hell (you can&#39;t get out of something you&#39;re not in). This means that you are some sort of terrible person, probably a child molester or some one who talks at the theater. This notion of leaving Hell kind of makes &quot;eternal punishment&quot; seem a little less eternal. But, let&#39;s play by their rules and assume for a bit that Hell is indeed an escapable place so we can extrapolate further.</p>
<p>Anybody who is mildly familiar with Monopoly knows that when you land in jail there are three ways of getting out: get our of jail free card, roll doubles, or pay $50. Applying these rules to our great Hell-break scheme - as these seem to be the rules we&#39;re playing by - there are now <em>other</em> ways with which to escape eternal damnation. If you&#39;ve got some extra cash, just be sure to be buried with some tenners or, if you&#39;re not, play it like a game of chance, bring some dice and pray to God that you get doubles (remember, you get three throws). Suddenly, your chances of escaping Hell are looking pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Now that we have traversed the psychology cleverly hidden in this image, we can finally extract it&#39;s true message: Hell is for poor people.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Walking for Cash</h2><time>April 25, 2010</time><div><p>As I&#39;d briefly <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/parental-pimps/">touched upon</a> in an earlier post, my place of employ is currently having a little fitness competition: can you walk 10,000 steps a day for 75 days? If you reach the grand and glorious total of 750,000, you are awarded two free days of vacation. Everybody was provided with company branded pedometers to keep track of our steppings and left to our devices.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m never one to turn down an opportunity to make <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5ZEzWwKJnY">money for nothing</a>, so I&#39;m doing my best to make a firm effort and accomplish this goal. If you take a look at the <a href="http://dxprog.com/blog/">blog main page</a>, you&#39;ll see that there is a graph with my current progress on this mission (assuming you&#39;re using an HTML5 compliant browser). As you may well notice, I&#39;m a few thousand steps shy of my quota for this week (shame on myself).</p>
<p>Now, that&#39;s the boring part. The cool part (and the reason I&#39;m posting) is the really the graph itself. Back in <a href="http://twitter.com/dxprog/status/6522777949">December</a> I switched the site codebase over to HTML5. Now, this was mostly a change in semantics, using new tags such as <article> and <section>. I&#39;d not done anything special with CSS3 or some of the newer, funner tags such as <video> or <audio>. One major thing I&#39;d really not looked too much into was the new <canvas> tag, with the ability to draw images in the browser on the fly.</p>
<p>That all said, I needed some place to test this exciting new functionality, and making the graph was just the place. To update update said graph, all I do is modify a JSON data file with my step information, and HTML5/JS takes care of the rest. Of course, this leaves people using IE in the dust, but this site was never designed for them anyways.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. A fitness contest spurned my thirst for learning. Now, if IE9 could speed along and summarily obliterate the install base of all previous versions before it, life would be a joy of canvasy win!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Parental Pimps</h2><time>April 22, 2010</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/parental_pimp.jpg" alt="" title="Daddy Pimp - A Staple of Every 50s Household"></p>
<p>So, I&#39;m walking around the downtown area, an activity I&#39;ve undertaken in an attempt to accumulate 10,000 steps/day for a work thing.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#39;m walking around enjoying the scenery and weather when I spot a giant billboard. On it is a man and his three young children. I was slightly touched by this nice picturesque scene... until I read the accompanying text:</p>
<p>[quote]Our daddy will sell your home... GUARANTEED![/quote]</p>
<p>In just a few words, this man went from upstanding role model of the American family to a parental pimp, whoring out his children to make a quick buck. Does anybody else find this kind of advertising appalling? </p>
<p>I see a commercial for a local used car reseller and his prepubescent daughter is going on about how her daddy will get you the best deal in town. Is this supposed to make people go &quot;awwww&quot; and rush out to buy a car, or are they marketing to pedophiles?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t know.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Miles Edgeworth - Ace Attorney Investigations - A Review</h2><time>March 14, 2010</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/edgeworth_review_10.jpg" alt="" title="Miles Edgeworth - Ace Attorney Investigations">
I don&#39;t make it a secret that I have <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-video-game-reviews/">thoroughly</a> <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/452291">enjoyed</a> the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/comic---pheonix-wright:-animal-attorney/">Ace Attorney.</a> <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/stuff-and-nonsense/">series</a>. There&#39;s so much to enjoy about them; the crazy cast of characters, the edge of your seat stories and the twists they take out of seemingly nowhere. Be it Mr. Wright himself or his vest wearing successor, Apollo Justice, there&#39;s no doubt that these are incredibly addictive, quality games. However, there was one character that we as fans had always wanted to play as, but were only given the opportunity briefly; the egotistic, pompous and slightly emo Miles Edgeworth. Well, Capcom heard the cries of the fans and bestowed upon us Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney Investigations.[break]</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>What the Ace Attorney series is most famous for (outside of people yelling &quot;Objection!&quot;) is the court room battles. Cross examining witnesses and doing battle with whatever prosecutor is thrown at you. This has been pretty much scrapped in <em>ME:AAI</em>. As the name implies, the focus is solely on the crime scene investigations and with it the biggest change in the series to date: free roaming. The player is given control of Edgeworth to roam around the various locales as they carry out the investigation. This is the gateway for old game staples such as examining a specific areas of the crime scene or the 3D turnaround of evidence you&#39;ve collected. A new mechanic is also added in the form of &quot;Logic,&quot; essentially a connect the evidence that opens up new paths of the story. And, while the courtroom setting may have disappeared, the cross examinations have not, which is good as they are the funnest (and most annoying) part of the game. This works as it has in all the previous games with pressing statements and presenting evidence. All in all, I think the new investigation mechanics are nice and supplement the carry overs quite well. Certainly a far cry better than the static menus of yore.</p>
<h2 id="graphics-and-sound">Graphics and Sound</h2>
<p>Being that this is essentially a text adventure, there&#39;s not a whole lot to say about the graphics. There are more animations than there were in previous games, but at the same time less. Apollo Justice upped the ante by providing some full motion interstitials, but these have all but disappeared leaving us with mostly partially animated stills for cut scenes. A lot of sounds and music themes have been carried over to <em>ME:AAI</em> with some additions and remixes. It&#39;s all fits in well with the series as a whole and the mood of the game, though there is one piece of music that reminds me of something from Capitalism II...</p>
<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>Being that it&#39;s not a graphical game or anything that challenges your reflexes, the Ace Attorney series relies heavily on its story. Like it&#39;s predecessors, <em>ME:AAI</em> delivers and then some. There are five cases of increasing lengths through out the game, all of them intertwined to form a long arc. One thing I noticed as I was playing, is that the sense of immediacy I felt during the courtroom bouts in the prior games was gone. This doesn&#39;t tarnish the story really, but does show that removing that setting does give it a different feel.
There are plenty of carry overs from previous games, from story line references to characters. Obviously, Edgeworth&#39;s faithful and bumbling assistant Dick Gumshoe is back, but it&#39;s amazing how many characters they manage to bring back. Of course, there are also new characters that will join the ride, including a new, cute teenage assistant. After all, what Ace Attorney game would be complete without one?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the seemingly new format for the game, some might be worried that this might not live up to the other entries in the series or be too &quot;new&quot; and destroy that which we loved about them. That is entirely not true and delivers all that&#39;s enjoyable about Ace Attorney in a slightly modified and, in my opinion, a more streamlined format. Any fan of the series should enjoy this as much as the others and I highly recommend dropping the $35 bones to get it.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>A Nerdy Rant About Nerds</h2><time>February 27, 2010</time><div><p>As some of you who <a href="http://twitter.com/dxprog">follow me</a> on Twitter may have <a href="http://twitter.com/dxprog/status/9488096354">noticed</a>, I recently crafted a small bit for inclusion in the write in portion of Anime News Network&#39;s <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman">Hey, Answerman!</a> column. Unfortunately, I was snubbed there and didn&#39;t have my writings brought to a larger than usual mass, but as I was planning on ranting about that topic on my blog anyways, I shall put it here regardless. (Damn you, Answerman!!!)</p>
<p>The question put forth was thus:
[quote]How open are you about your anime love with friends, family, and colleagues? Do you wear anime cloting, or read manga on your break? Be honest, damn it![/quote]</p>
<p>His incorrect spelling of &quot;dammit&quot; notwithstanding, here was my response:</p>
<p>[quote]When it comes to sharing my feelings of the various Japanese related media that I ingest on a day-to-day basis, I&#39;m really very open. After all, why is it that just because a person likes media from a different country, they should be ashamed? For that matter, why are they persecuted? People who really enjoy sports or cars or anything &quot;normal&quot; don&#39;t have to face this problem, but they&#39;re doing the exact same thing we &quot;otaku&quot; do; follow, enjoy and obsess over their particular subject of interest. I suppose it&#39;s the &quot;die hards&quot; that taint the perception of the anime crowd, but aren&#39;t we all annoyed by that one person who won&#39;t shut up about his obsession (whatever it may be)? But, now I&#39;m delving into another topic all together.
I enjoy my anime, my manga, and Japanese culture in general and I&#39;m not afraid to share that enjoyment with those I&#39;m with. But, at the same time, I try to keep in mind that they may not enjoy the subject as much as I do and adjust my level of enthusiasm accordingly.[/quote]</p>
<p>One thing I did not mention, but was actually a driving force for me writing something in the first place, is a nerd&#39;s treatment of another type of nerd. To rant about somebody else&#39;s fanboyish obsessions while you yourself are guilty of the same crime, though it may be in a different field, should be punishable by damnation. Granted, I myself am guilty of this, but there it is.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Two Years of Anime - Part 2</h2><time>December 29, 2009</time><div><p>Here we are at part 2 of the Matt&#39;s Grand Anime Review. Today I focus mainly on shounen/action genres.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-ball-z">Dragon Ball Z</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_dragon_ball_z.jpg" alt="" title="Dragon Ball Z">
Without <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> the American anime market may very well not exist (certainly not the way it does today). <em>DBZ</em> is certainly an entertaining show, what with all the rediculous battles and &quot;power up&quot; sequences, but it&#39;s not without its faults. Cheesy and reptitive animation dampen the action sequences and there really isn&#39;t a whole lot of character development. In fact, I consider <em>DBZ</em> to be almost like a &quot;bro show&quot;. And, toss on the fact that no character can ever really die and a lot of the suspense has just been killed. But, at that, it does make for some excellent entertainment if you&#39;re willing to overlook the formulaic plots and the aforementioned other problems. <strong>6/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="sayonara-zetsubou-sensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-sensei</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_zetsubou_sensei.jpg" alt="" title="Sayonara, Zetsubou-sensei">
Take a manically depressed school teacher, who believes that everyone and everything is out to get him, add about a dozen high school girls, throw them into a classroom and you&#39;ve got <em>Sayonara, Zetsubou-sensei</em>. If anything, <em>Zetsubou-sensei</em> is like a politcal and social satire cartoon somewhat like <em>Pinky and the Brain</em>, though far more dark and with less world taking over. Each character in the show has their very own specific personality trait which, when combined with the brooding titular character, leads to some unique and hilarious moments. Of course, being a political/social commentary, there are a lot of cultural refernces that I&#39;m lightyears away from understanding, but at that just the rediculousness of the whole situation is entertaining. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="naruto">Naruto</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_naruto.jpg" alt="" title="Naruto">
As <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/perhaps-some-dusting-is-required/">mentioned before</a>, <em>Naruto</em> is almost single-handedly responsible for my spiral into anime. I personally would consider <em>Naruto</em> to be <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> done better. It falls squarely into the same type of plots, following a group of fighters as the run around training and saving the world. However, Naruto has far stronger characters and less of the &quot;oh, they can revive everybody with the Dragon Balls should some one die&quot; thing hanging in the background. Granted, that&#39;s not to say it&#39;s perfect. Most of the main characters have really annoying personality traits; for example Naruto the stupid hot head, Sasuke the emo and Sakura the fawning girl/hot head. Luckily, there&#39;s a fairly extensive cast of supporting characters that can usually make up for these flaws. The stories themselves can be formulaic often resorting to bad guy shows up, something sad and dramatic happens, much fighting ensues, Naruto comes in with a speech or something and saves the day. Even still, it&#39;s an enjoyable watch and I wouldn&#39;t be writing this article were it not for this show. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="excel-saga">Excel Saga</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_excel_saga.jpg" alt="" title="Excel Saga">
Trying to explain <em>Excel Saga</em> to anybody would be like trying to explain nuclear physics to a peanut butter sandwich. It just can&#39;t be done. In a nutshell, <em>Excel Saga</em> follows the exploits of two lackey&#39;s to an organization trying to take over the world. Our two protagonists, the hyper-energetic Excel and the often dying Hyatt, go on various missions in attempts to infiltrate. This is usally setup within the first two minutes and everything that follows is generally absolute randomness. However, it&#39;s not so random as to be off-putting. No, it goes beyond that into a brand new level of hilarity. I can&#39;t really explain it anymore, so just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x39Jp-z61M">watch this clip.</a> <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="trigun">Trigun</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_trigun.jpg" alt="" title="Trigun">
I watched Trigun as the result of a deal with one of my many, many brothers. The stage is set on some distant planet with an old west style theme. The story is told from the perspective of a couple of girls working for an insurance claims department as they follow the world reknowned outlaw, Vash the Stampede. It feels like <em>Trigun</em> tries to tackle too many issues at once, attempting to be episodic while having a larger story arc. The further the show goes on, the more things fall apart, but I&#39;ll cut it some slack as the manga went into hiatus in the middle of animation. All in all, it&#39;s good but not great. <strong>6/10</strong>
So, that&#39;s that. Expect the third and final installment this Sunday. It&#39;ll be a treat to be sure.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Behold, the Gift of Art!</h2><time>December 26, 2009</time><div><p>As a kind of quick Merry Christmas to anybody reading this blog, I bring to you some of my latest art pieces.

</div></article><article><h2>Two Years of Anime - Part 1</h2><time>December 26, 2009</time><div><p>Here begins three articles of anime reviews. Yes, I know I said two in the previous post, but after creating the list I realized it would be more prudent to split this into three. This also allows me to kind of categorize things and I&#39;ll kick the list off with cute and romantic comedies. Another thing to note is that my criteria have changed. The movies and video games were all things <em>released</em> in 2008-2009. These are all things I <em>watched</em> in those years. So, without further ado, here is part one of my anime reviews.</p>
<h2 id="midori-days">Midori Days</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_midori_days.jpg" alt="" title="Midori Days">
<em>Midori Days</em> falls into the latter of the aforementioned categories. The premise is absolutely rediculous opening with protagonist Sawamura Seiji waking up one day to find that a tiny girl, Kasugano Midori, has replaced his right hand. Oddly enough, even though the show indulges in more fan service than any other I&#39;ve watched, there was never a raunchy moment, something I thought odd considering the premise. The overall story follows these two as Midori tries to win over Seiji who is otherwise distracted by just about every other woman within eyesight... except the ones that actually like him. The show is full of plenty of laughs and feel good moments and I&#39;d certainly recommend watching it if you are interested in the genre. <strong>7/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="lucky-star">Lucky Star</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_lucky_star.jpg" alt="" title="Lucky Star">
One of my earlier forays into anime, Lucky Star is.... well, I&#39;m not entirely sure. Sure, it follows a group of high school girls, but that&#39;s about it. It follows these girls unusual conversations about various pop-culture, day-to-day things and Japanese culture references. Because of the Japan centric themes, I have a difficult time following being American. As the show goes on, these jokes and references become more mainstream, but the show itself is just random conversation. The only thing that really kept me watching was the cute artwork (I&#39;m secure enough in my manhood to admit that). <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="ichigo-mashimaro">Ichigo Mashimaro</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_ichigo_mashimaro.jpg" alt="" title="Ichigo Mashimaro">
<em>Ichigo Mashimaro</em>, or <em>Strawberry Marshmallow</em>, is in pretty much the same vein as <em>Lucky Star</em>, except drop the age of the girls to twelve and remove most of the pop-culture/Japan/etc references. What makes <em>Ichigo</em> better than <em>Lucky Star</em>, in my opinion, is that it&#39;s far more universal in its ramblings. For example, in the first episode, the girls all try to stay up late making a birthday gift for one of the girls&#39; sister. This is something I can relate to as my bros and I have done this before, only for our parents. It&#39;s a cute take on the slice-of-life genre and I certainly enjoyed watching it. Oh, and it has one of the best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzGbA1ov_WE">Engrish scenes</a> ever. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="karin">Karin</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_karin.jpg" alt="" title="Karin">
I do not like Vampires or anything Halloween related, even more so now that vampires are gay, angsty teenagers who sparkle in the sunlight. That said, the titular character of <em>Karin</em> is a vampire. Or rather, she&#39;s an un-vampire, injecting blood into her victims instead of the other way around. This is an interesting little romantic comedy that I didn&#39;t like initially but came to really enjoy. Througout its twenty-four episodes, it never really deviates too much from the main plot; that is, developing the relationship between Karin and her classmate Usui Kenta. The last couple of episodes are certainly intense and will leave you wondering what path the show will take. So, even with my general dislike for occultish things, <em>Karin</em> is worth a watch. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="bokusatsu-tenshi-dokuro-chan">Bokusatsu Tenshi - Dokuro-chan</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_bokusatsu_tenshi.jpg" alt="" title="Bokusatsu Tenshi - Dokuro-chan">
Remember when I said that I was convering cute things and romantic comedies? <em>Bokusatsu Tenshi</em> is neither of those. It&#39;s straight up, almost slapstick style comedy, something I&#39;d associate more with western cartoons. The basic premise of the story is that Dokuro, an angel from the future, has been sent to stop protagonist Sakura from creating a pedophile world; that is, a world in which all women stop aging at twelve. This only really comes into play in the first episode and everything else is just random situations. Oh, did I mention that Dokuro often kills Sakura in the most bloody and rediculous manner and then brings him back to life? There are a lot of really hilarious moments in this show and it saddens me that it only runs a handful of episodes. Perhaps that&#39;s for the best, though. <strong>7/10</strong>
So, there is the first wave of reviews. Next week I&#39;ll be covering more generic shounen stuff. What is week three you may ask? That, my friend, is a surprise.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Two Years of Video Game Reviews</h2><time>December 24, 2009</time><div><p>It is time now for the second wave of &#39;08/&#39;09 reviews with today&#39;s column covering video games.</p>
<h2 id="star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2008-xbox-360-">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008, Xbox 360)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_force_unleashed.jpg" alt="" title="Star Wars: The Force Unleashed">
There was quite a bit of hype surrounding this game when it came out. It was supposed to be a Star Wars IP that the world hadn&#39;t seen since <em>Shadows of the Empire</em>. Did it live up to the hype? Depends on who you ask. I didn&#39;t buy it until recently, but I definitely had fun playing it. That said, there were also many points where I was frustrated out of my mind to the point of controller throwing (something I&#39;ve not done in years). Some of this was due to faulty game mechanics, but mostly my own incompetence. Sadly, the game is fairly repetitive in terms of combat and I found myself relying on Force lightning to handily finish off every enemy I came across. There are plenty of options for combat such as push and choke and, of course, your lightsaber, but none of these were as handy or wholly satisfying as lightning. Oh, and for all the hype about Euphoria, never once did I see a stormtrooper <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/2/1/">grab another in mid air</a>. <strong>7/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="animal-crossing-city-folk-2008-wii-">Animal Crossing: City Folk (2008, Wii)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_animal_crossing.jpg" alt="" title="Animal Crossing: City Folk">
The ever successful Animal Crossing franchise made its way onto the Wii last fall and... it&#39;s Animal Crossing. It keeps a lot of things from its DS pedecessor such as the rolling log world, but also brings back things sorely missed from the GameCube version such as separate houses for each player. The graphics have finally received a much needed bump, especially in the area of textures. The models, however, still remain fairly low-poly in some instances and the lighting isn&#39;t really helping anything in that department. Some things have been handled better than they were in the first game, such as moving some of the random occurances to permanent stores within the city. All in all, <em>City Folk</em> just as fun and addictive as the original (110 hours of play doesn&#39;t lie), though I am slightly disappointed that it wasn&#39;t changed up more. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="apollo-justice-ace-attorney-2008-ds-">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (2008, DS)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_apollo_justice.jpg" alt="" title="Apollo Justice">
After three highly successful (and truly amazing) Phoenix Wright games, Apollo Justice comes in to fill the shoes of the pointy-haired defense attorney that preceeded him. <em>Apollo Justice</em> is the first <em>Ace Attoreny</em> game designed specifically for the DS and they came up with some interesting ways to utilize the hardware. The cutscenes are fancier and the artwork is higher color, but it feels very much the same. The court scenes haven&#39;t really changed, though a new dynamic similar to Psyche-locks has been added. The stories are everythig you&#39;d expect from the series making <em>Apollo Justice</em> worthy of the <em>Ace Attorney</em> title. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="resident-evil-5-2009-xbox-360-">Resident Evil 5 (2009, Xbox 360)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_resident_evil_5.jpg" alt="" title="Resident Evil 5">
I&#39;ve never played any of the <em>Resident Evil</em> games before, but when a college buddy brought it over I played co-op with him. Surprisingly, it was a really fun game. The controls worked well and there were always plenty of zombies around to shoot. Granted, some areas kind of sucked balls, such as the boat trip through the swamp, collecting all the crystals in that temple/cave thing and, of course, the damned quick time events. But, those aside, it looked and played very nice and offered a couple days of gaming fun. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="mad-world-2009-wii-">Mad World (2009, Wii)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_mad_world.jpg" alt="" title="Mad World">
I&#39;ll say this up front: paying $50 for this game without having played it first was a mistake. I was hooked by the uniqueness of the look and the idea that somebody was actually going to make something uniquely tailored to the Wii without being kiddie shovelware. It does look interesting, but upon close perusal, the graphics don&#39;t hold up. I didn&#39;t really know where the hell I was going half the time, and, while there are some unique ways to kill people, it was easier just to button mash. The interstitials with the pimp guy were kind of funny and John DiMaggio is always evntertaining, but there wasn&#39;t any content to keep me playing. With a whole two hours of play time, I wound up trading it in. <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="scribblenauts-2009-ds-">Scribblenauts (2009, DS)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_scribblenauts.jpg" alt="" title="Scribblenauts">
This is becoming a sad list of overhyped disappointments. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, under the surface of Scribblenauts lies an incredibly clever and inventive game. With a list of some 20,000+ objects you can call upon to complete various puzzles, there&#39;s a world of promise here. However, the execution was less than stellar. The objectives were generally vague, leaving me scratching my head as for what to do and when they weren&#39;t, I found myself solving most puzzles with a rope and helicoptor.The biggest offender, however, was the controls. The character and placement of items is all controlled via touchscreen and, if you are not very specific about where you click, you&#39;ll wind up careening to an untimely death. Honestly, the title screen for <em>Scribblenauts</em> was probably the funnest part, being just a sandbox with which you can do whatever you want. I was so hopeful for this game and I hope that the developers take a step back, realize where they fucked up, and try it again. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="rhythm-heaven-2009-ds-">Rhythm Heaven (2009, DS)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_rhythm_heaven.jpg" alt="" title="Rhythm Heaven">
It should be no secret at this point that I am a fan of rhythm games, but Rhythm Heaven is a unique and extremely fun take on the genre. There are dozens of mini-games based around two simple control guestures: touch and flick. It&#39;s so simple, yet you&#39;ll put in a crazy amount of hours if you want to get golds and perfects on each song. Speaking of which, this game has one of the funnest soundtracks I&#39;ve heard in a while. Granted, not every one is a hit (espcially the localization of the sung tracks), but it&#39;ll always get your toes (and stylus) tapping. The art style and mini-games themselves are reminiscent of Wario Ware and is both fun and outlandish. There&#39;s plenty for everybody here and I&#39;d definitely recommend picking up a copy if you own a DS. <strong>10/10</strong>
Of all these games, the Game of the Years award would hands down go to Rhythm Heaven. It&#39;s just so damned addictive and fun. Keep your eyes peeled as I&#39;ll wind up this series of reviews with a two parter covering all the anime I watched this year.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Two Years of Reviews</h2><time>December 19, 2009</time><div><p>The year is beginning to wind down and Christmas is just around the corner. I&#39;ve consumed quite a lot of media this year, from my newfound addiction to anime and the usual domestic shows and video games. Over the next couple of weeks, I&#39;m going to review what I considered to be the best of the best in each genre. Today, I&#39;ll start off with movies. I&#39;m going to fudge a little bit and include movies released last year as well, otherwise this would be a really short list.</p>
<h2 id="the-incredible-hulk-2008-">The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_incredible_hulk.jpg" alt="" title="The Incredible Hulk">
Honestly, I just watched this movie for the first time tonight. I will preface by saying that I really didn&#39;t have any issues with the 2003 film and saw the reboot of a reboot so close together a little ridiculous. However, that aside, the new film was enjoyable. I didn&#39;t love this film, nor did I hate it. It&#39;s pretty much the basic tale of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk and how he attempted to cope with it. There&#39;s plenty of action to go along with the story and everything flows well. One thing I will pick on, however, was how bad the CGI in this film was. At times I felt like I was watching something that had been rendered with the UT3 engine and there was even a scene where the green screen keying failed to suspend my disbelief. <strong>7/10 </strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="iron-man-2008-">Iron Man (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_iron_man.jpg" alt="" title="Iron Man">
The second super hero movie on this list. Unlike <em>Hulk</em>, though, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing film. Again, it&#39;s another origins tale detailing how weapons designer and super genius Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and his adventures as such. What really makes this movie work so well is Stark and how he is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. His playboy asshole persona is enough to make you say &quot;what a dick&quot; and yet still be completely likeable. Some criticize this movie for its lack of action, but this was never a problem for me. We see plenty of Iron Man flying around and blowing things up, but it&#39;s the character development that really shines. The only negative to this movie is the lack of a really strong antagonist. Finally, if you buy the DVD, splurge on the special edition version as it has some really good documentaries (best I&#39;ve seen since Star Wars II). <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="wall-e-2008-">Wall-E (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_wall_e.jpg" alt="" title="Wall-E">
Andrew Stanton once again takes the helm of the Pixar engine after a three movie reprieve since <em>Finding Nemo</em> to deliver another wholly wonderful experience worthy of both the Pixar name and his reputation. I think Ben Burtt, sound designer for both this film and, more notably, the <em>Star Wars</em> films, accurately described <em>Wall-E</em> as &quot;R2 the Movie&quot;. It follows the story of one garbage robot, Wall-E, as he is whisked away from a garbage-apocalyptic Earth and finds love and adventure amongst the stars. To pull off a film in which none of the main protagonists really talk, and do it so well, is a testament to both Stanton and Burtt&#39;s abilities. Everything about this film just oozes cute and feel good, but it&#39;s the first twenty or so minutes that really shine, both from a story telling standpoint but most especially from the art direction. The desolation of Earth is sold so well and the score underlines the mood perfectly. There is the environmental subtext, but I never found it so prominent as to be off-putting. <em>Wall-E</em> ties for first with Nemo as my favorite Pixar film of all time. <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="kung-fu-panda-2008-">Kung Fu Panda (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_kung_fu_panda.jpg" alt="" title="Kung Fu Panda">
I was expecting <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> to be a huge pile of crap. After having seen the trailers on TV time and again, I hated this movie before it had even hit theaters. After some prodding by friends, I grudgingly went to see it and thank heavens I did. There is so much to love about KFP. It&#39;s the story of a nredy, fat, noodle-making panda - Po - who is chosen to as the prophesied &quot;dragon warrior&quot; that will rid the world of the evil Tai Lung. The story and humor are excellent, the visuals and art direction are stunning and, for a kids movie, it has a lot of superbly executed action pieces. The opening sets the mood for the film so well and Jack Black does a spectacular job voicing Po, adding just enough of his personality to the character without overdoing it. There are plenty of genuinely humorous moments in the film and amazingly never resorts to fart jokes. Finally, the score is absolutely fantastic with many Asian motifs playing through and setting the tone for the film quite excellently. This is the first CG animated film that I would dare to put on par with any Pixar fare and it does so with flying colors. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="wanted-2008-">Wanted (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_wanted.jpg" alt="" title="Wanted">
This was another film that I was talked into seeing. Sadly, it&#39;s largely forgettable. The plot is so bizarre that I was never really sold on it and thus tainted the rest of the experience. A machine weaving binary messages into cloth? Please. The MythBusters episode where they tackled the curving bullets - one of the major elements to this film - was more entertaining. However, this is meant to be simply an action flick and I suppose it passes as that. <em>Die Hard</em> it is not, though. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="star-trek-2009-">Star Trek (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_star_trek.jpg" alt="" title="Star Trek">
SPOILERS AHEAD, YE BE WARNED. This was one of two films that I was really looking forward to seeing this year and honestly the only one that I was really hyped about. I even went to see it on opening weekend, the only other film to have that honor was Revenge of the Sith. What I received was, in my opinion, an enjoyable action flick but a poor <em>Trek</em> movie. The way that Abrams (whom I will address in just a moment) decided to rewrite the story was fine in theory, but came off as wholly unbelievable. Why would the cataclysmic battle at the beginning of the film so drastically change things in the design world (I.e. ship design, interfaces, etc)? How is it even possible that those characters would wind up in the same positions on the same ship as in the previous timeline? And what was with Uhura&#39;s random spontaneous thing for Spock? I was waiting for the reset button to be pressed at the end of the movie, but was depressed when there was none. Star Trek has never been entirely action oriented opting instead for more situationally based, cerebral stories. However, what we got in this was another over CGed affair with more eye candy than brain food. And, while I&#39;m on the subject, a direct message to Mr. Abrams:
They invented the tripod for a reason. It&#39;s so the camera isn&#39;t shaky. My vision is blurry enough without you giving camera control to Michael J. Fox (no offense, Mr. Fox). And all that lens flare and bloom? This isn&#39;t the 90&#39;s. They aren&#39;t cool, they don&#39;t add anything, so stop using them.
While being critically acclaimed, I do not believe that this film holds a candle to most of the even-numbered films in the series and place it on par with Nemesis (my least favorite). If you want a really good TOS <em>Star Trek</em> movie, my pick would be <em>Undiscovered Country</em>. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="up-2009-">Up (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_up.jpg" alt="" title="Up">
Much like <em>Cars</em>, the premise for <em>Up</em> had me worried. The trailer only mildly interested me at best (though it looked great in 3D). Sadly, unlike <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>, it didn&#39;t do anything to sway my opinion in the other direction. The story follows an old man who attaches a crap ton of balloons to his house and flies to South America. While the opening few minutes of the movie are probably some of the best cinema has ever seen, the story that follows is simply to bizarre and disjointed. I didn&#39;t really find myself attached to any of the characters&#39; plights or that I even cared for them much. However, that said, this movie does offer up quite a bit in terms of comedy, especially through the character of Dug. There&#39;s really not much else to say about the film except maybe that Michael Giacchino&#39;s score was well-suited and enjoyable. This ranks second to last on my Pixar list, right about <em>Cars</em>. <strong>6/10</strong></p>

Here&#39;s a deceptive one. &quot;From the director of Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was what they touted in the trailers and spots, knowing that most people think Tim Burton directed said movie. Well, he didn&#39;t and he had no involvement on this film (thank God). Based on the popular children&#39;s novel of the same name, <em>Coraline</em> is a thoroughly wonderful and enjoyable film. Coraline Jones finds herself in a new and strage house with a room containing a small doorway leading to many a fantastical adventure. It is unique but at the same time twisted and I believe that the way they translated the book to the screen worked very well (despite taking some liberties). What really shines in <em>Coraline</em>, though, is the animation. Stop motion is certainly not very favorable these days, what with CG being much faster and cheaper. However, what they&#39;ve pulled off in this movie is absolutely stunning and even more so when you watch it in 3D (like I was able to in the theater). I personally will be rooting this film for Best Animated Picture when Oscar season rolls around. <strong>9/10</strong>
If I had to choose which of these films I believe was best, I think the award would go to <em>Iron Man</em>. Everything about it is just so enjoyable and watching Downey Jr&#39;s performance is an absolute treat, something you don&#39;t see in cinema too often anymore.

There were numerous things that made it interesting, from my going to the Tulsa State Fair to sitting teaching myself HTML 5. However, the highlight of that month was my trip to San Francisco to interview with Digg.[break]</p>
<p>Somewhere towards the beginning of the month I had gotten an e-mail from Jobvite about a new Digg position as I am wont to do. The difference between this e-mail and the others was that I was actually qualified for the job in question. Without hesitating, I fired out my resume and cover letter but didn&#39;t really expect anything to come of it. After all, we&#39;re talking about one of the most visited websites in the world and certainly they&#39;d want somebody with real working experience (of which I really did not have).</p>
<p>But, to make a long story short, I got a call from the recruiter (while I was at aforementioned fair) and that interview went well. I was then setup to talk to one of the developers and interview with him. That interview also went well. Then began the week of craziness.</p>
<p>I had received an e-mail from the recruiter saying &quot;We&#39;d like to bring you out here for more interviews.&quot; I was, of course, more than a little excited at this proposition. I e-mailed back asking when so I could get tickets lined up and got a reply saying &quot;Oh, I forgot you were in Oklahoma. Well, we&#39;ll shoot for this date and time.&quot;</p>
<p>So. after a quick trip to Expedia, I had my tickets and hotel lined up shortly after which I received another e-mail stating that &quot;I need to get approval first.&quot; A dashing blow to be sure, but luckily this was brought to light fast enough that I could cancel my tickets without incurring any fees.</p>
<p>The next day or so dragged on as I waited to hear again about whether or not I would be interviewing. The answer was yes, a date was set and again I had my tickets ready to do. Then came a call saying &quot;Oh, hey. There&#39;s a developer meeting on the day you&#39;re having your interview. How about the day after?&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if this were any other company than Digg I may have said &quot;Really? If you can&#39;t get it together I&#39;m not going to bother.&quot; But, this was Digg and this was a dream job, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and cancelled/repurchased my tickets. Yes, I&#39;m at seven paragraphs and I&#39;ve yet to set foot on a plane.</p>
<p>Luckily, this was the end of the planning Hell and in a couple days I was on the plane flying out to the City by the Bay. I was excited to finally be moving forward with this. My plane left Tulsa at 6am cdt and arrived in San Fran at 11:40pdt, the entire time dressed in my interviewing clothes.</p>
<p>Now, on this last set of tickets I passed on both a car and hotel as these tickets were much more expensive due to the short notice. So, I hitched a ride on the train to some street close to the Digg offices and hiked the rest of the way. Initially, it took a while to get pointed in the right direction as everybody I asked on the street around the train station did not seem to know where any street was. Eventually, I did get there (after about a mile of walking in the San Francisco heat) and just in time. I entered the building with a bunch of developers who were coming off lunch and entered the Digg lobby.</p>
<p>The lobby is pretty much what I expected: trendy and slick. There were two couches with little digg pillows on them and a big digg sign on the wall. I checked in, signed an NDA, and began the actual interview. And a whirlwind that was.</p>
<p>Over the four hours of interviews I had I think I learned more than in my entire time at Full Sail. I was thrown all sorts of questions ranging from how to avoid duplicate entires in a database caused by two users submitting the same thing at the exact same time, to how to get paid even amounts of gold for a job over the course of seven days without cutting said bar more than two times. In the end, I was neutral about the interview as a whole; some went well some not so well. I didn&#39;t know what to expect as I exited the building.</p>
<p>The trip home was long as I had to stay overnight in the San Francisco smelling like sweat due to all the walking I had done that day. It was not pleasant to say the least and I apologize to any passenger who had the misfortune of sitting next to me. But, I figured if I got a job at Digg it would all be worth it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week where I finally received an e-mail from the recruiter saying that they had passed up on hiring anybody for the position at all. I&#39;m not too angry or disappointed as I am now employed with Griffin New Media and I did get an experience I&#39;ll remember for a good many years to come. Perhaps in the future I&#39;ll have the opportunity again and maybe will have a little more luck then.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Ajax and the User Experience</h2><time>November 12, 2009</time><div><p>The code running this website is well over a year old now and, as I&#39;ve gone back to upgrade/fix things, I&#39;ve noticed that it is clunky and highly inflexible. The implementation I&#39;ve used is actually very, very similar to what I used in YPNgine back in 2003; a switch statement calling functions from an included script based upon variables passed in the query string. Granted, there&#39;s going to be some degree of that in any implementation, but through some tinkering with the music page and interviewing with some of the developer&#39;s at Digg has led me to a new paradigm: a set RESTful API calls independent of all front end management.</p>
<p>Now, aside from the nice code separation and simplification of feature adds and maintainability this provides, it also opens up a new world to Ajax. Since all the data is accessible via query string, almost all the usual functionality that would normally call for separate pages can be added in without ever having to leave the landing page. In fact, I&#39;ve <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/dxsite2">implemented this</a> functionality on the test server. As interesting as this may sound, it raises some interesting issues concerning usability and the user experience.</p>
<p>The largest concern is that of site navigation or, more specifically, navigation history. In a normal site, every page you visit will be added to the site history, appending itself to the not only pages visited, but the forward and back buttons as needed. With Ajax, you have none of this. Were you to click a link to a story and have it loaded via Ajax, your browser history does not change. Pressing the back button will take you to the previous entered URL and not the previous page because, technically, you&#39;re still on the same page. The new page won&#39;t be placed in browsing history which could make finding back a particular story particularly difficult. And, finally, because the page never changes, neither does the URL in the address bar which could lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Say you entered my site on the gallery page using the url <a href="http://dxprog.com/gallery">http://dxprog.com/gallery</a> and eventually found your way to to the June 2006 blog archives, specifically to a story about my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/tryin-to-survive/">life without a laptop</a>. Because the page never actually changes, the address bar will continue to read <a href="http://dxprog.com/gallery">http://dxprog.com/gallery</a> even though that content is no longer there. This would have made my retrieval of the URL for that story more difficult and, had the title not been permalinked, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to retrieve it at all.</p>
<p>Another thing to take into consideration is search engines. When Google crawls your site it doesn&#39;t have JavaScript enabled. So, unless you write duplicate functionality to generate the page before sending to the browser, none of your content will get indexed. I face this problem with the current gallery implementation; even though there is a way for me to access individual items via the query string, there are no hard links on the gallery page itself to point to them. Even if there was, all of the content is loaded on the client side so search engine spiders are just going to get a blank page devoid of content. Not a very smart idea if you want that content indexed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when it comes to Ajax and dynamically loading content, you really have to consider carefully what should and shouldn&#39;t be dynamically loaded. Portal pages - any page with links into sub pages of the site such - are probably best left to the traditional method of loading a new page for each item. Smaller things such as paginating an entry&#39;s comments probably wouldn&#39;t hurt as much since it is an aside to the main material. Though, even then there may be something interesting you&#39;d want picked up on a search engine. It&#39;s really is a balancing act between slick functionality and overall usability.</p>

<p>ID3Lib [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/ID3Lib.zip">Download</a> ]</p>
<p>As one may have derived from previous posts, I have a <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/smp/">project</a> the uses MP3s quite heavily. As such, retrieving tag data from these is quite an important thing. Having recently migrated my personal server to Windows, I needed a non-Linux variant of my previous <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/building-a-web-based-media-player---part-1/">tag read</a>. I thought that while I was at it I could add an additional feature, namely saving embedded album art. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any clear directions on how to do so using <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">TagLib</a>, so I created my own library. Three different times. In three different languages. A C++ version, a .NET version and, finally, a PHP version.[break]</p>
<p>Each of these libraries works pretty similar, but to give you the general idea, I&#39;ll write out a simple program for each.</p>
<p>[code=c++]#include <iostream></p>
<p>#include &quot;id3lib.h&quot;</p>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>void main () {
    ID3Lib id3(&quot;my.mp3&quot;); // Create the object
    if (!id3)
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Unable to parse file&quot;;
    else {
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Title: &quot; &lt;&lt; id3.artist() &lt;&lt; &quot;n&quot;; // Output title using shortcut method
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Album: &quot; &lt;&lt; id3.tag(&quot;TALB&quot;) &lt;&lt; &quot;n&quot;; // Can retrieve any tag with this method
        id3.saveAlbumArt (&quot;album_art.jpg&quot;); // Save any embedded picture
    }
}[/code]</p>
<p>[code=c#]using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using Id3Lib_Net;</p>
<p>namespace Id3LibNet_Test
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Reader t = new Reader(&quot;my.mp3&quot;); // Load the MP3 file
            Console.WriteLine(t.title()); // Print out the title using shorthand method
            Frame album = t.getFrame(&quot;TALB&quot;); // All loaded tags can be retrieved this way
            t.savePicture (&quot;album_art.jpg&quot;);
        }
    }
}[/code]</p>
<p>[code=php]include (&quot;id3lib.php&quot;);</p>
<p>$id3 = new ID3Lib (&quot;my.mp3&quot;); // Create the ID3Lib object
if (!$id3-&gt;getErr()) { // Will be null if load was successful
    echo (&quot;Title: &quot;.$id3-&gt;title); // A shortcut for getting the title
    echo (&quot;Album: &quot;.$id3-&gt;tags-&gt;TALB); // All tags can be accessed this way
    $id3-&gt;savePicture (&quot;album_art.jpg&quot;); // Saves an embedded picture
}
else
    echo (&quot;There was an error opening the MP3: &quot;.$id3-&gt;getErr());[/code]</p>
<p>Each library includes a set of methods/properties for the following common tags: title, album, artist, disc, track, year.</p>
<p>All three libraries are licensed under the GPLv3 and have the original source code, so you can do with them what you wish, though credit and a link back here is always nice :-).</p>
<p>ID3Lib [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/ID3Lib.zip">Download</a> ]</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I have only tested these on MP3s I have available to me, so it&#39;s very possible that you may have issues with this library. If you do, please leave a comment and I&#39;ll update the libs accordingly.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Getting a YouTube FLV through PHP</h2><time>October 4, 2009</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/php_corner.png" alt="" title="PHP Corner">
Recently, while making some additions to the <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/smp/">Music Page</a>, I came across the need to get the location of a YouTube FLV. Unfortunately, most of my googling turned up outdated results that no longer work. Fortunately, unlike a certain <a href="http://hulu.com/">other</a> site, it&#39;s not impossible. Below is a quick explanation of what I got to work. I&#39;ll be assuming that you know how to get your hands on the video ID (the &quot;v&quot; parameter in the query string).[break]</p>
<p>There really is only one thing that&#39;s needed by YouTube to get the video file, and that&#39;s the video token. As far as I can tell, this is a time sensitive key that is generated for the user to prevent abuse on the YouTube servers. Luckily, this is pretty easy to obtain. The get_video_info page returns not only the token, but all sorts of other valuable information about the video, such as author, date uploaded, length in seconds, etc. Here&#39;s a small function that retrieves this information and returns it as an object:</p>
<p>[code=php]function ytGetInfo ($id)
{
    $file = file_get_contents (&quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?&amp;video_id=$id">http://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?&amp;video_id=$id</a>&quot;);
    $a = explode (&quot;&amp;&quot;, urldecode ($file));
    foreach ($a as $i) {
        $e = explode (&quot;=&quot;, $i, 2);
        $ret-&gt;$e[0] = $e[1];
    }
    return $ret;
}[/code]</p>
<p>Simple stuff, really. The contents of get_video_info are retrieved and stored in $file. This information comes URL encoded, so we first need to decode that. As with any URL string, each variable is separated by an ampersand (&amp;), so when calling <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php">explode</a>. That returns the variable/value pairs in an array ([0]=&gt;&quot;author=dxprog&quot;, [1]=&gt;&quot;token=asi940tnas&quot;, ...). Iterating through each of those, we then explode the var/value pairs and add them to our outgoing object. Now we have the token (amongst other info), so next will be retrieving the video file itself.</p>
<p>YouTube uses get_video to return where the actual video is stored. Now, I don&#39;t know all the nuances of this method, but as of this writing, it returns a 303 See other HTTP response code with the location header pointing to the actual, real address of the video file. We&#39;ll functionize that:</p>
<p>[code=php]function ytGetVideoPath ($id)
{
    $info = ytGetInfo ($id);
    $token = $info-&gt;token;
    $headers = get_headers (&quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/get_video?video_id=$id&amp;t=$token&amp;fmt=18">http://www.youtube.com/get_video?video_id=$id&amp;t=$token&amp;fmt=18</a>&quot;);
    foreach ($headers as $item) {
        if (strpos ($item, &quot;Location: &quot;) !== false) {
            return str_replace (&quot;Location: &quot;, &quot;&quot;, $item);
        }
    }
    return false;
}[/code]</p>
<p>First thing this function does is grab the video information so that we can get the token. We then retrieve the headers of the video providing the video ID <em>(v)</em> and the token <em>(t)</em> as parameters to get_video. The <em>fmt</em> parameter specifies the quality video you want, none being low, 18 being high, and 22 being HD. Using the <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.get-headers.php">get_headers</a> function, we should be returned a 303 response code with the location header set to the video location. I can&#39;t guarantee that this is always the case, but it hasn&#39;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>From here, you can do with the returned URL as you please. You can use <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php">file_get_contents</a> or <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php">fsockopen</a> - my favorite - to download the stream, load it into your flash video player or whatever you want. I hope you found this little guide useful. If you run into any problems with the above code, please leave a comment below and I&#39;d be happy to help. Cheers!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Pretty pictures abound</h2><time>September 27, 2009</time><div><p>In the downtime during my ever continuing quest for employment, I&#39;ve taken up a few extra hobbies to keep from going completely bored. <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/twitstats/">Some</a> are more <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/phpgraphs-a-php-graph-drawing-library/">relevent</a> to my future line of work, while others are simply for my enjoyment.</p>
<p>One thing that I&#39;ve attempted to take up again is drawing. My skills currently sit somewhere between mediocre and decent, a stat I&#39;d certainly like to level up. So, my brother Chris and I have periodically enjoyed an evening of drawing while watching the nerdy sitcom, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">Big Bang Theory</a>. Unfortunately, we&#39;ve finished the first two seasons and now are forced to wait a week for new episodes, as the third season just began.

<p>In keeping with my new found - and probably unhealthy - fascination with the land of the rising sun, I&#39;ve been taking cues from the manga/anime style (much of which is fan art).

</div></article><article><h2>phpGraphs - A PHP Graph Drawing Library</h2><time>September 7, 2009</time><div><p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/phpgraphs.png" alt="" title="phpGraphs">
Over the past few days, I&#39;ve been developing a library to help in drawing graphs for various stuff on the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page">music page</a>. I&#39;ve built to to be a fairly complete solution that is both robust and simple to use. Today, I offer phpGraphs to the masses to do with as they please, <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/phpGraphs_1.0.zip">free of charge.</a> Follow the break for a quick tutorial on how to use it.[break]
phpGraphs requires PHP5 and the GD2 extension to be enabled. To install, simply copy the phpGraph.php to a place accessible to your script.
Here&#39;s a small script that sets up the graph object an adds data:
[code=php]include (&quot;<a href="http://dxprog.com/phpGraphs.php">http://dxprog.com/phpGraphs.php</a>&quot;);</p>
<p>$graph = new Graph (&quot;My Graph&quot;, 640, 480);
$dataSet = $graph-&gt;createDataSet (&quot;Data Set 1&quot;);
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 50; $i++)
    $dataSet-&gt;add (rand () % 100);[/code]</p>
<p><strong>Line 2 - </strong>Here, we include the phpGraph library. Pretty self-explanitory.
<strong>Line 4 - </strong>We create our graph object in the variable $graph. The argument passed is the title that will be drawn at the top of the graph. The second two parameters are the width and height of the image, respectively.
<strong>Line 5 - </strong>This creates a new dataset with the name &quot;Data Set 1&quot;. It returns a pointer to the dataset object within the graph object. You can create an infinite amount of data sets, though there is a visual limitation I will discuss later.
<strong>Line 6 - </strong>Calling the <em>add</em> function of the object returned on line 5 will add data to the set, in this case a random number from 0 to 100.
phpGraphs has the ability to draw four different types of graph. They are: line, vertical bar, horizontal bar and pie. Following is an example of each graph type along with the function prototype.
<img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/phpGraphs_line.png" alt="" title="Line Graph">
[code=prototype]image drawLineGraph (xLabel, yLabel, [drawLegend = true], [divisions = 5]);[/code]
<img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/phpGraphs_vbar.png" alt="" title="Vertical Bar Graph">
[code=prototype]image drawVertBarGraph (yLabel, [drawLegend = true], [divisions = 5]);[/code]
<img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/phpGraphs_hbar.png" alt="" title="Horizontal Bar Graph">
[code=prototype]image drawHorzBarGraph (yLabel, [drawLegend = true], [divisions = 5]);[/code]
<img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/phpGraphs_pie.png" alt="" title="Pie Graph">
[code=prototype]image $graph-&gt;drawPieGraph ([drawLegend = true]);[/code]
All of these are functions of the Graph object and aach returns a handle to a GD image that you can do with as you please. Some notes on the parameters:
_xLabel - _Label to be drawn on the X axis
_yLabel - _Label to be drawn on the Y axis
_showLegend - _Defines whether to show the legend or not. This is turned on by default. If the legend is disabled, the graph will enlarge to fill the image.
<em>divisions - </em> This says how many times to divide up the Y axis (X for horizontal bar graphs). The default is 5, which should work well in most cases.</p></p>
<p><p>By default, phpGraphs has colors set for text, image background, data background, grid, and twelve colors for data sets. Now, as I mentioned above, you can have an infinite amount of data sets, but after the twelfth the color will be black as no colors are set beyond that. phpGraphs, however, gives you complete control over the colors you wish to use. The functions are as follows:</p>
[code=prototype]Graph-&gt;setBgColor (r, g, b, [a = 0x00]);
Graph-&gt;setDataBgColor (r, g, b, [a = 0x00]);
Graph-&gt;setTextColor (r, g, b, [a = 0x00]);
Graph-&gt;setGridColor (r, g, b, [a = 0x00]);
Graph-&gt;setDataColor (index, r, g, b, [a = 0x00]);[/code]
_r, g, b - _The red, green and blue values of the color. Valid value range is 0-255.
<em>a</em> - Alpha of the color. Valid values are 0-127, with 0 being completely opaque and 127 being completely transparent.
_index - _setDataColor allows you to change the color of the lines, bars and slices used for data. The index value specifies the data set number. Valid valus are 1-infinity.
Below is an example of a graph that has a custom color scheme:
<img src="http://dxprog.com/pics/phpGraphs_custom.png" alt="" title="A graph using custom colors">
Expounding upon the example given above, here is how a complete script would look.
[code=php]include (&quot;<a href="http://dxprog.com/phpGraphs.php">http://dxprog.com/phpGraphs.php</a>&quot;);</p>
<p>// Create the graph and add some data
$graph = new Graph (&quot;My Graph&quot;, 640, 480);
$dataSet = $graph-&gt;createDataSet (&quot;Data Set 1&quot;);
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 50; $i++)
    $dataSet-&gt;add (rand () % 100);</p>
<p>// Draw the graph
$img = $graph-&gt;drawLineGraph (&quot;Iteration&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;, false);</p>
<p>// Add the appropriate headers so the browser recognizes this as an image
header (&quot;Content-type: image/png&quot;);
imagepng ($img);
imagedestroy ($img);[/code]

</div></article><article><h2>Celebrating One Year of the Music Page</h2><time>September 1, 2009</time><div><p>For the casual frequenter of my blog, you&#39;ve probably seen me mention the illustrious <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/building-a-web-based-media-player---part-1/">Music Page</a> before. It has been my pet project for a year now and has been the catalyst for a few leaps in coding practice for me. Firstly, it&#39;s responsible for my becoming quite adept at advanced &quot;OOP&quot;-like JavaScript-ing. Secondly, it&#39;s given me an outlet to try out new things such as dynamic graphs in PHP or using Bing&#39;s search API. Let&#39;s take a brief walk through history.[break]</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;ll mention about the Page that has been intrinsic to every version: the whole concept is based on disposable playlists. Unlike iTunes or Windows Media Player which has you going through a huge list either right clicking to add to playing or ctrl-selecting and dragging off into a permanent playlist, the Music Page queues up songs in a single click, which I believe makes it a whole lot faster and easier to set up whatever music I want to listen to.</p>
<p><strong>The First Version</strong>
[url=<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1.jpg">http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1.jpg</a> &quot;Music Page v1&quot;)[/url]
The first version of this project was really just a front end for playing MP3s through my server and didn&#39;t actually involve any streaming at all. It was more of a &quot;see if a can&quot; type thing without any real plans for fleshing out a full app. That didn&#39;t come until I decided to throw in a the Flash app.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t remember exactly why I decided to create the streaming player; perhaps so I could listen to my music while I was working at school. In fact, I believe I started this project in the month I had my PHP class. While everyone else was struggling trying to create the simple home page that was required, I was off doing extra-curricular activities. An ass I am.</p>
<p>The page pretty much stayed like this for quite some time. Somewhere, I moved everything to two columns and added playlist support, but that was it. No fancy effects, no JavaScripty goodness. Hell, it didn&#39;t even get a look refresh until November when I made a Christmas theme.
[url=<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1_winter.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1_winter.jpg">http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1_winter.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_1_winter.jpg</a> &quot;Music Page v1 - Winter Theme&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p><strong>Music Page v2</strong>
[url=<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_2.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_2.jpg">http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_2.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_2.jpg</a> &quot;Music Page v2&quot;)[/url]
The second revision of the page saw quite a lot of additional features. The first big change was completely dropping PHP for any kind of front end job. Instead, it handled data management and everything else was handled by JavaScript through Ajax. This was the real beginning of my JavaScript coding days. I&#39;d been piddling around with jQuery for a little bit before, but now I brought it out in force.</p>
<p>The second major update was the layout. Instead of having a giant list of everything off to the right like you see in most desktop media players, I hid all the track names and moved the album list to left. This, coupled with the addition of album art thumbnails and the larger font for album names, made it far easier to find the songs I was looking for. Additionally, I also included the ability to save playlists.</p>
<p>Finally, another welcome feature, was the inline upload form (not shown). Using a bunch of Ajax calls and a little C++ application to grab ID3 tags, I was able to quickly upload a whole bunch of songs without having to go to a different page or worry about page refresh due to form submission. This made the addition of music a thousand times easier. However, a page refresh was still required to update the album list on the left.</p>
<p>But, as had happened with the first one, I began shoe-horning features on that the original code base and design had never been intended for. So, I began work on the be all and end all of the Music Page.</p>
<p><strong>Music Page Rev. 3</strong>
[url=<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3.jpg">http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3.jpg</a> &quot;Music Page Rev. 3&quot;)[/url]
With the current iteration, I&#39;ve rewritten the entire code base from ground up (except the PHP stuff. It&#39;s stayed mostly the same). This is more of a evolutionary revision as opposed to the revolutionary of v2.</p>
<p>Again, this version has seen PHP kicked even more to the curb by revoking its right to sort all the data before sending it to the page script. All of the tracks are loaded and sorted on the fly in JavaScript, which allows me to fully update the album list whenever I wish, such as after the addition of new MP3s.</p>
<p>In visual changes, I moved all the playlist data off to the right and added pages for each of the various functions. This makes the left column much less cluttered while giving the other functions the time of day they deserve. Also, by creating the paged portal, I leave plenty of room for me to expand in the future. This has already come in handy as I&#39;ve been adding features the last couple days that weren&#39;t originally intended.</p>
<p>First is the play history graph, as seen in the picture above. Before, I&#39;d been using a <a href="http://twitter.com/dxmusic">twitter account</a> to track my play history (and, somewhat successfully, last.fm before that). However, I&#39;m now storing play history in a local table in the database for the sole purpose of tracking stats (another page I could add in the future). The second feature is the addition of inline album art search.</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3_art.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3_art.jpg">http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3_art.jpg]![](http://dxprog.com/pics/music_page_3_art.jpg</a> &quot;Music Page Rev. 3 - Album Art Search&quot;)[/url]
Using the Bing API (because Google&#39;s doesn&#39;t do image search), you can scour the webs to locate, download and set album art. The text box shown above is filled with the name of the album by default, but you&#39;re able to enter in custom terms and search to your heart&#39;s content until you find what you want.</p>
<p>So there&#39;s a history of what the Music Page has gone through. It&#39;s been quite an adventure pulling this thing together and I&#39;ve certainly learned a lot from the experience. The one thing that I think makes this project sweeter than just a fun past time is the fact that it&#39;s a viable application. I literally have not used any desktop music player since I created this thing (my brothers too). Being that I actually use it on a day-to-day basis gives me an advantage in seeing what&#39;s working, what&#39;s not and what I would like to added. I wish all projects could work out this well.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Search for Spock, where the value of Spock = Job</h2><time>August 21, 2009</time><div><p>So, I&#39;ve been out of school for nearly two months now. Of course, it took them this long to get me my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/3843402434/sizes/l/">diploma</a>. Now, I am usually a fairly patient person, but there is one exception to that rule: mail order. Waiting for this diploma was like ordering something from Amazon and then having to wait two years for it to get here. But, it&#39;s here now and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>Well, it would be if I had a job. I&#39;ve applied to three places now, those being <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/">ConocoPhillips</a>, <a href="http://www.griffincommunications.net/properties/businesses">Griffin New Media</a> (both web dev jobs), and a contract motion graphics job out in Florida with <a href="http://www.feldentertainment.com/">Feld Entertainment</a>. Phillips I didn&#39;t hear back from for a month and a half and at that the only contact I had was a short note saying I&#39;d been passed up. I got calls from both Griffin and Feld (on the same day even), but Feld never called back after their initial call.</p>
<p>Griffin, on the other hand, has taken an interest in me and I&#39;ve had two interviews there now (both of which went pretty well, in my opinion). The people I&#39;ve interviewed with have been extremely nice and seem to have my interests in mind as well as theirs. My first interview seemed mostly to quiz me on my web development knowledge in addition to establishing what the position I&#39;d applied for entailed. The second was more formal in terms of the questions asked and the environment in which it was conducted. Also in that interview, I had to take a skills test in which was given an hour to design and code a small contest entry page. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to finish everything on the list, though my design was good and my HTML validated first crack out of the barrel. So, at this point I&#39;m waiting to hear back from them. I&#39;m really hoping for this job because it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve been working towards the last several years and the environment and people working there are really nice.</p>
<p>Outside of job hunting, there hasn&#39;t been too much more going on in my life. So, instead of wasting precious bytes telling you how awesome the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0eNHP9rBcg">Taiko no Tasujin</a> series of games is, I&#39;ll wrap it up here.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Welcome to Esoteria</h2><time>July 22, 2009</time><div><p>I find myself at the end of my college life, living back in good ol&#39; Oklahoma and completely bored out of my skull. Of course, there is on the near horizon the promise of employment, which should take up the next forty years of my natural life. I should relish these moments as I will not have a moment like this in some time... especially if a wife and kids are part of my ultimate master plan. But, I suppose itemization is in order.</p>
<p>Nearly a month ago, I completed my college education and graduated from Full Sail University with a bachelor of science in Digital Arts and Design. The ceremony was all very pomp with much circumstance. During my particular ceremony, there were some two hundred people graduating (all of the bachelor kids, not just my class). I marched along the line of my old instructors shaking their hands (and getting hugs from one). It felt kind of ethereal and even now I&#39;ll stop suddenly and realize... it&#39;s over. Everything that had sucked up my very being for the last twenty-one months is finished.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s all done and now I&#39;m back home with my family. Not a bad place to be, I suppose. The plan was to take a hiatus after the near non-stop barrage of school. It&#39;s been nice, no doubt about that, but now I feel restless. I want to do something and I don&#39;t have anything that needs to be done. So, that would suggest to me that it&#39;s time to return to the working forces, a new and more educated man.</p>
<p>Actually, a couple weeks back I applied at ConocoPhillips (the family workplace) for an opening they had for an ASP.NET developer. I&#39;ve yet to hear anything, but my application is supposedly under &quot;secondary review&quot; same as it has been since the offer closed on the seventeenth. The waiting is killing me and never have I been so eager to receive a phone call. I suppose if this falls through (as it&#39;s kind of looking like, but I&#39;ll give it a bit more time) there&#39;s another place in town that I&#39;m going to apply at. It&#39;s a design group that I more than qualify for (HTML/PHP type stuffs), so maybe I&#39;ll have some more luck there.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to find a job soon. I suppose if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll have more time to update this blog. Hooray for you.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Graduating to a New Look</h2><time>July 11, 2009</time><div><p>Welcome, one and all, to the brand new and totally spiffy dxprog.com! I&#39;m sure I say it every time I do this, but this iteration is by far the most advanced version of the site to date. I can pretty much wrap up all the updates in a nutshell by saying I&#39;ve had a lot of fun throwing in all sorts of jQuery and Ajaxy stuff, but I&#39;ll itemize.</p>
<p>The front page, for starters, shows the latest and greatest projects and blog posts on the site in the featured pane. The gallery has undergone a huge overhaul and is much more intuitive than it was before. I&#39;ve also uploaded quite a lot of new content to the gallery page, so go take a gander at that to see what awesome stuff I&#39;ve been up to. And finally, even the contact is looking spiffier with a picture of yours truly and a link to all the social media outlets I&#39;m currently signed up for.</p>
<p>With the new design out of the way, I&#39;ll shift focus to the new {mh}labs; section of the website, where you&#39;ll be able to find all sorts of little pojects that have never been released to the general public (and some that have).</p>
<p>The future is bright at dxprog.com, so be sure to bookmark us and return often for all sorts of goody goodness.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>All Good Things</h2><time>May 28, 2009</time><div><p>It seems that ignoring the blog is the fashionable thing for me to do, as of late. It&#39;s not entirely intentional, there&#39;s just really nothing to talk about. Sometimes, while I&#39;m attempting to force myself into a state of unconsciousness, I&#39;ll think of these things I&#39;d love to post ranting about this, that, or the other. However, rarely do I actually act upon these impulses and the dust continues to gather.</p>
<p>The one thing that has happened since I last blogged is the passage of time. And with that passage I draw ever nearer to my graduation date. Currently, I sit at less than a month till I walk with my fellow classmates and receive the piece of paper for which I have worked so hard to achieve. It&#39;s hard to believe that not two years ago I was making preparations to come here the thought of actual completion not even in my head. But, here we are.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve achieved much in my short twenty-one months at Full Sail, both from an academic and personal standpoint. I&#39;ve improved my design skills, learned the technical art of motion graphics, and added to my repertoire of marketable programming skills through ActionScript. I know better how things in the industry work and have finally been able to get the professional critique that I so longed for as a hobbyist working out of his parents&#39; house.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made a lot of memories at this school, both good and bad. It&#39;ll be sad to have leave all the friends I&#39;ve made, but everyone tells me I have a bright future ahead of me. As for what I think of that, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I know I have marketable skills, but there are some things that I know will hold me back. For example, I would like to live close to my family. That alone throws out almost any motion graphics or film job that I could have. I suppose it boils down to what&#39;s more important to me: my family and friends or my career. Even at that, I don&#39;t really know what career path I&#39;d like to do. i enjoy and am proficient at many things (both inside and outside my degree).</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;ll stop there before I completely depress myself. The next few months are going to have a crucial part in shaping my future. I&#39;d better make damn sure I get it right.</p>

<p>[code=php]
// Return values
define (&quot;TWITTER_OK&quot;, true);
define (&quot;TWITTER_UNAUTHORIZED&quot;, -1);
define (&quot;TWITTER_TOO_LONG&quot;, -2);
define (&quot;TWITTER_COULD_NOT_CONNECT&quot;, -3);</p>
<p>function sendTweet ($status, $userName, $userPass)
{</p>
<pre><code>// Open a socket to Twitter
if (!($socket = fsockopen (&quot;twitter.com&quot;, 80)))
    return TWITTER_COULD_NOT_CONNECT;

// Create the headers
$headers = &quot;POST /statuses/update.xml HTTP/1.1\r\n&quot;;
$headers .= &quot;Host: twitter.com\r\n&quot;;
$headers .= &quot;Authorization: Basic &quot;.base64_encode ($userName.&quot;:&quot;.$userPass).&quot;\r\n&quot;;
$headers .= &quot;Content-length: &quot;.strlen (&quot;status=$status&quot;).&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;;
$headers .= &quot;status=$status\r\n&quot;;

// Send the headers
fwrite ($socket, $headers);

// Get the response
$response = &quot;&quot;;
while (!feof ($socket))
    $response .= fgets ($socket, 1024);

// Check for HTTP status OK (200)
if (!strpos ($response, &quot;200&quot;))
    return TWITTER_UNAUTHORIZED;

return TWITTER_OK;
</code></pre><p>}
[/code]</p>
<p>It is as simple as it looks. Enjoy!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A coding compo!</h2><time>February 10, 2009</time><div><p>I was sitting in lab last night bored out of my skull. Yes, I could have (and should have) been working on my project, but when you&#39;re already ahead of schedule it&#39;s okay to slack off now and again.</p>
<p>So, as I was saying, I was sitting there and I think &quot;Hey. I&#39;ll make a game between now and when final roll is called.&quot; I turned to Ryan and asked him what game I should make to which he replied &quot;Space Invaders.&quot; I figured &quot;Why the hell not? I did that back when I was fourteen.&quot; I told my bro (whom I was Skyping at the time) and he was like &quot;Yeah, well, I bet I can make Asteroids before you can finish Space Invaders.&quot; The gauntlet had been thrown and much coding ensued.</p>
<p>After a couple hours of some intense typing and trying to pull down sprites off of the crappy ass wireless in the school, my Space Invaders clone was complete. Not two or three minutes later my bro finished his game, but alas it&#39;s not Flash and can&#39;t be embedded in browsers like so:</p>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" style="width:640px; height:480px;" data="http://www.dxprog.com/files/SpaceInvaders.swf"><param name="movie" value="http://www.dxprog.com/files/SpaceInvaders.swf" /></object>

<p>It is by no means a mind blowing or even polished game, but for just two hours I&#39;m not complaining. And I also had a hell of a lot of fun coding it which is the important part.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t be a total dick and not give Chris any credit. In his defense he did create a vector renderer from scratch (I say create because technically he wasn&#39;t actually coding). His game&#39;s visuals are also far superior to mine, so be a dear and <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/files/asteroids.zip">check it out</a> as well (some Windows and DirectX are required).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I Feel Compelled to Write</h2><time>February 2, 2009</time><div><p>It is another month and with that another wave of classes. Lucky me has class six days a week! (except next week where I only have class four days. Whatever.) So, you&#39;re probably asking &quot;Hey, Matt! What kind of awesome stuff do you get to do this month?&quot; To which I answer &quot;Have you not been paying attention, compadre? Classes aren&#39;t fun anymore.&quot; This month is the exciting world of portfolio creation and business communication (see this, here, now? I&#39;m communicating. Perhaps to businesses).</p>
<p>But, school aside, I&#39;ve been having a rather fun time rewriting the interface to that <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/building-a-web-based-media-player---part-1">media player</a> I brought up some months back. This time, however, the entire front end is all ajaxy and delicious. Don&#39;t believe me? <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/Music">Check it out</a> for yourself, but don&#39;t be ripping off my songs, hear? Though, you&#39;d have to get a flash decompiler or something to actually find where they are on my server. It&#39;s all very exciting.</p>
<p>In some days (by which I mean tomorrow) I will the happy owner of a brand new Wii Fit (only cost me twenty extra over retail). Since I left Wal-Mart I&#39;ve put on some weight - about thirty pounds. Feeling more like a pregnant lady in her third month than the macho man I am, I felt it was time to do something about that. So, I might do a weekly update thingy here as that progresses, though we all know what happens when I promise regular updates of some sort.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I like to google myself and my friends, probably because I have far too much time on my hands. It&#39;s an interesting thing to do and one I recommend to my peers (by which I mean other internet micro-celebrities). Interestingly, I seem to have the most web presence of the classmates I googled. Granted, I have had a little bit of a <a href="http://youngprogrammers.net">head start</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvOAW-KZqCo#t=8m24s">bump</a> here and there. I suppose it isn&#39;t the most common thing ever to be featured on the front page of various gaming sites (twice), but surly somebody in that class has done <em>something</em> that&#39;s caught the attention of the internet. Then again, I do seem to be <em>that guy</em> as devusb so fervently calls it, and unfortunately I have to agree. That&#39;s probably why I still spend most of my time alone with my computer while everybody else is out smoking weed and getting laid. Or perhaps the internet fame happens because I stay at home by myself. But, we&#39;re not here to get into the chicken/egg debate. Actually why don&#39;t we.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Chicken or the egg. Which came first?
<strong>A:</strong> Who cares, they&#39;re both delicious.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that&#39;s enough nonsense for one afternoon. Besides, I have other equally unimportant things I could be doing, like checking digg/Joystiq/Engadget, stalking people on Facebook/Twitter, binge drinking all my troubles away, the usual.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Perhaps some dusting is required</h2><time>January 20, 2009</time><div><p>It&#39;s been quite some time since I last graced the interwebs with my esoteric writings. Much has happened since then and, on the flip side, much <em>hasn&#39;t</em> happened since then. Hell I don&#39;t even remember what the last thing I wrote <em>was</em>. But, no matter. That&#39;s why God invented tabbed browsing.</p>
<p>Going back over some of my more recent posts, it seems that I made some sort of attempt to be more... professional. That is, I attempted to be a help to the community at large, injecting into it my insights and examples. However, after some recent soul searching over break, I realize that this is not who I am, nor is it who I wish to be. I simply wish to be myself and for my blog to continue on much the way it has for so many years. That is to say, contain the trials, tribulations, and joys of my life. So, with so much time to catch up on, where does one begin? I suppose it&#39;s best to find out where one left off...</p>
<p>I suppose the last <em>meaningful</em> post was about the <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/from-the-orlando-anime-festival/">anime festival</a> I attended in August. Now, back then I felt like an outcast amidst a lot of freaks (in a good way, however). But, since then, I too have fallen victim to the Japanese and tantalizing animations. I suppose the beginning of my downfall was when I picked up and was subsequently sucked into the Phoenix Wright games. It didn&#39;t help that I was prodded along the way by a buddy of mine (who will be called Ryan for lack of a made up name). He showed to me Hellsing, an anime about some vampire killing organization, the Catholic Church, and nazis. As crazy awesome as this combination may sound, vampires and the occult really aren&#39;t my forte. So, he pushed me towards Dragon Ball Z, which, I must admit, is not only awesome, but totally over nine thousand. From there I ventured out on my own checking out anime on Netflix&#39;s instant watch (Project A-ko and Best Student Council). My biggest pitfall was when Hulu picked up Naruto. Everybody and their chibis seemed to be completely enamoured with this show and, even though I&#39;d previously shunned it as I had all anime, I watched an episode. And another. Two weeks later and not only had I watch one hundred twenty episodes, but I&#39;d also read all the manga after the point I&#39;d left off. I&#39;ve also watched and completed Lucky Star (all the dubbed versions, at least) and the Meloncholoy of Haruhi Suzumiya. So, I can no longer consider myself the portent of anime&#39;s destruction (as I once wanted to be). Instead, I am a lowly otaku. Damn.</p>
<p>School-wise, nothing terribly interesting has happened. I&#39;ve completed all my film courses, made a level for UT3, created a magazine and TV packaging, and now I&#39;m back to web design. How I hate you, web design. Web programming, that&#39;s okay. I enjoy programming, However, I&#39;m beginning to realize how much I don&#39;t enjoy actual design. The process of coming up with some idea out of nothing is one I find very difficult (though, I usually execute it fairly well). However, with programming I know what I&#39;m trying to achieve and the steps to get there a fairly linear and even allow for a good bit of problem solving which I do love. That said, I still enjoy film making and motion graphics.</p>
<p>The good news about school is that I&#39;ve got less than half a year left until graduation. I&#39;m not entirely certain what I&#39;ll do after that. One thing I <em>do</em> know is that I&#39;ll be heading back home for a couple months to simply do nothing. Full Sail, while it hasn&#39;t been <em>terribly</em> difficult has left me drained of nearly every creative juice in my body as well as killed off almost all of my motivation. That can be attributed to the fast pace of the scheduling where every month I have to design my way out of another two classes. I&#39;ve enjoyed my time here, but I&#39;ll also be glad when it ends. It means I get to go on and do something awesome (hopefully VFX, programming, or motion graphics).</p>
<p>Other than that nothing very exciting has happened to me. It&#39;s all school and what play there is generally involves me sitting on my ass in front of this computer monitor surfing the nets or whatever recent project has caught my fancy. I promise that I won&#39;t let another agonizing two months go by before I update again, but with nothing happening it&#39;s hard to find something to write about. Perhaps you should follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dxprog">Twitter</a> for all the little random things and thoughts of mine. Until next time, be cool and stay in school.</p>

Everything is very simple and clean almost to the point of being sterile (as in the hospital, not the inability to bear children). However, one disturbing trend seems to be their boxes. Not the fronts, mind you, but rather the backs. Join me as I go through a box design from every generation of Nintendo console (save N64) and grade them on design.[break]</p>
<p>Legend of Zelda (NES)
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/zelda_box.jpg" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Now, being of thick German heritage I&#39;m going to allow the Nazi in me to speak for a second. The first two sentences in that first paragraph should be rolled together with a comma seperating them, not two sentences. But enough about that, more about the design. They&#39;ve used their space wisely on this one. There&#39;s plenty of informative text on the left and some snazzy screenshots of Link kicking ass on the right. The text placement on the left bugs me a little, especially with that strategy guide picture throwing off the alignment of the text to the right. I also think they could&#39;ve used a font that wasn&#39;t so narrow as it makes things seem a little crowded. The UPC and logos on the bottom are nonintrusive to the other elements on the box. The logo (or lack thereof) kind of bothers me, but being the first game in the franchise I&#39;ll go easy. On the whole, this box conveys its message in a manner that&#39;s pretty easy to read and for that I give Legend of Zelda a B.</p>
<p>Star Fox (SNES)
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/starfox_box.jpg" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>In my opinion, the best design of all the box arts I will review. The logo up in the corner is super kick ass and plays off the title nicely. The text directly below is rediculously crisp and easy to read and the changup in color is a nice way to guide your eye to where they want. The pictures of the Fox team are well placed (and pretty awesome, too) and fit the theme pretty nicely. Of curse, there are the screenshots balancing out the upper left and advertising the 3D amazingness of the Super FX chip whose logo is below. The logos at the bottom are still pretty reserved, though they kind of do creep up into the main part of the box. I also think the Super FX logo should have been down there or placed closer to the block of text advertising it. However, this is an awesome box design, easy to read and kick ass looking to boot. I give Star Fox an A.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door (GCN)
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/mariorpg_box.jpg" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Here&#39;s where things begin to go south. First of all, the &quot;requirements&quot; is throwing off the flow of design. It is far too tall for being up at the top. I understand the utilitarian-ness of it, but taking up that much room? How about you move it down to the bottom and once you&#39;ve sold the game and person wants to know this, then they&#39;ll see it. The main text on this, whilst not illegible, is very close to bordering on it. The color is very similiar to that of the background (hence the white border), but their choice of font wasn&#39;t helping either. You should rarely or never use a stylistic font such as this for blocks of text. It works well for the &quot;What Sleeps Behind the Door?&quot; banner, but not very well for everything else especially when they get the text really small underneath the screenshots. And while we&#39;re talking about the screen shots, these are actually okay for the most part, at least the ones on the bottom. Then there&#39;s the random screenshot up at the top right that was probably thrown in as a space filler because of the crap that sits to its left. The Mario characters filling in the vertical gaps between the top and the screenshots is decent, though their placement seems slightly uninspired. And, what&#39;s the the random confetti bits? There&#39;s so few of them that it seems out of place. Finally, the logos and stuff at the bottom are now taking up a third of the entire box. Why the hell do you need to shove down my throat so much that playing your game will give me seizures? Not only do you tell me on this box, but you also include a booklet about it and the first screen of the game tells me! My final verdict on this one is a C, kind of nice looking but bordering on difficult to read.</p>
<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/brawl_box.jpg" alt="" title="image">
And, here we are. The uber clean Wii generation. Oh? What&#39;s this? This box looks more like the back of a Microsoft product instead of the cleanly designed crap from Cupertino. I really don&#39;t even know where to begin on this one. I suppose I&#39;ll start by saying all the text is microscopic and it&#39;s even worse if you are a border jumper and have to read the ranslations. Which makes me ask: why so many damned translations? Last I knew America was a predominately English spaking country and I&#39;m pretty sure this game is also in English. And, dear God, why is all the text in comic sans? It would be hard enough to read in a nice, clean sans-serif font, but this is unacceptable. With all that extra text they&#39;ve had to stick in crappy ass &quot;screenshots&quot; and I put that in quotes because most of them look like freeze frames from the first E3 trailer. There are two real screenshots: the one at the top and the teeny, tiny one in the online play box. All this stuff seems to just have been vomitted on the canvas with very little rhyme or reason and it&#39;s extremely difficult to read. And, finally, the part that pisses me off the most. If you&#39;d paid attention to the last three boxes you&#39;d have noticed that there was an alarming trend where the logos, barcodes, warnings, etc. gradually took up more of the box. Well, on Smash Bros Brawl they went whole hog and now it occupies HALF THE FUCKING BOX! With all those red warning labels, I feel more like I&#39;m reading the back of a bottle of cyanide pills than a game box. And, of course, it&#39;s in fifty thousand different languages. WHAT THE FUCK?! I WANT TO GET SEIZURES, POR FAVOR! How about you throw in a robot that tells you that you&#39;ll get seizures whilst raping your ass with a spiked dildo?! You&#39;re already raping our eyes, how can it get worse?! The only real good thing that can be said about this one is that the possible controllers seems more out of the way, but it&#39;s of little use as they cram more stuff in than a drunk Paris Hilton. My final rating: F</p>
<p>Well, Nintendo, you keep on making all your stuff seem &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;inviting&quot;. We all know the truth and that truth is hiding on the back of each and every game box that is sitting on store shelves with your name on it.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Building a Web-based Media Player - Part 1</h2><time>August 31, 2008</time><div><p>For the past month I&#39;ve been tinkering with Flex and my little Linux server. One of the projects that grew out of this was a web media player with which I could listen to all my tunes wherever there happened to be some scraps of internet. This has been one of the coolest projects I&#39;ve worked on in some time. It successfully blends nearly all of my programming skills: PHP/MySQL, Javascript, XML, Flex/Actionscript 3.0, and some C++. I&#39;m going to write a series of tutorials walking through what I&#39;ve done in hopes of bringing this coolness to the masses. I&#39;m going to be fairly verbose covering subjects that any seasoned programmer can pretty much skip over. In the first installment I&#39;m going to cover creating the database and getting song information from the MP3s.[break]</p>
<p>The first thing to do, obviously, is set up the database tables. I&#39;ve kept my setup fairly minimalistic having tables for artists, albums, and tracks. I plan to expand later to track playback habits and so forth, but these are all you need to make your player fully functional. I&#39;ve got my tables setup as follows:
<strong>artists</strong>
[list][item]id (int 4, primary key)[/item][item]name (varchar 100)[/item][/list]
<strong>albums</strong>
[list][item]id (int 4, primary key)[item][item]title (varchar 100)[/item][item]artist (int 3)[/item][/list]
<strong>tracks</strong>
[list][item]id (int 11, primary key)[/item][item]title (varchar 100)[/item][item]artist (int 4)[/item][item]album (int 4)[/item][item]track_num (int 3)[/item][item]play_count (int 5)[/item][item]date_played (int 11)[/item][/list]
Most of these fields should be self-explanitory. The tracks table can expand or contract to include what ever metadata you want (I personally left out genre as I hardly ever use that). date_played will store the Unix timestamp of the last time the song was played. I personally like storing my timestamps without formatting as to forego the unnecessary strtotime () conversion. We&#39;ll use this later when we create the recently played list.</p>
<p>About now I would begin to discuss how we&#39;re going to get this information into the database, but first we need to be able to get the information from the files. I&#39;ve got two methods for this and it all really depends on your programming skills and what you have available on your server. The first, and most available option is through Actionscript. Let&#39;s jump to code.
[code=actionscript]var tagLoader:Sound = new Sound();
tagLoader.load (&quot;my_song.mp3&quot;);
tagLoader.addEventListener (Event.ID3, tagsLoadedHandler)
tagLoader.addEventListener (Event.COMPLETE, tagsLoadedHandler)</p>
<p>function tagsLoadedHandler (e:Event):void
{
    var title:String = tagLoader.id3.title;
    var artist:String = tagLoader.id3.artist;
    var album:String = tagLoader.id3.album;
    var track:String = tagLoader.id3.track;
    // Send to database
    tagLoader.removeEventListener (Event.COMPLETE, tagsLoadedHandler);
}[/code]
[b]<em>Lines 1-2</em>[/b]
Nothing terribly exciting. We set up our Sound object which will be loading the MP3 and getting ID3 information. Immediately after we load the MP3 file _my<em>song.mp3</em> into our Sound object.
[b]<em>Lines 3-4</em>[/b]
We set up two event listeners so we can catch the data. The first fires once ID3 information has been retrieved. Depending on your MP3 file, this event won&#39;t always fire so we set up the COMPLETE event so that the code is run regardless. We&#39;ll be talking more about that in the next tutorial.
[b]<em>Lines 8-12</em>[/b]
We store the song information for temporary storage until we send it all off to the database (covered in the next tutorial).
[b]<em>Line 13</em>[/b]
We remove the event listener on the COMPLETE event. In the probable case that the ID3 event was dispatched we want the COMPLETE event removed otherwise all this code will run again adding your song to the database twice. We don&#39;t want to pull and iTunes with duplicate song issues.</p>
<p>Alright, that&#39;s the first, and slowest way to do things. I say slowest because it actually requires that the song be downloaded to your computer before it gets the information. This isn&#39;t bad if you&#39;re on a LAN connection, but it&#39;s not near as fast as using the server itself to get the information (which we&#39;ll be doing now).
[code=c++]#include <taglib/tag.h></p>
<p>#include <taglib/fileref.h></p>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>void readID3 (char *fileName)
{</p>
<pre><code>TagLib::FileRef f(fileName);

cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t\\t&lt;album&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; f.tag()-&gt;album() &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/album&gt;\\n&quot;;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t\\t&lt;artist&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; f.tag()-&gt;artist() &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/artist&gt;\\n&quot;;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t\\t&lt;title&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; f.tag()-&gt;title() &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/title&gt;\\n&quot;;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t\\t&lt;genre&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; f.tag()-&gt;genre() &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/genre&gt;\\n&quot;;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t\\t&lt;year&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; f.tag()-&gt;year() &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/year&gt;\\n&quot;;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t\\t&lt;track&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; f.tag()-&gt;track() &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/track&gt;\\n&quot;;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{</p>
<pre><code>if (argc == 1) {
    printf (&quot;Usage --\\ntid3xml INPUT\\n&quot;);
    return 1;
}

cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;\\n&quot;;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;songs&gt;\\n&quot;;

for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t&lt;song file=\\&quot;&quot; &lt;&lt; argv[i] &lt;&lt; &quot;\\&quot;&gt;\\n&quot;;
    readID3 (argv[i]);
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t&lt;/song&gt;\\n&quot;;
}

cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/songs&gt;\\n&quot;;
return 0;
</code></pre><p>}[/code]
We&#39;ll be writing a small C++ program that reads ID3 information out of the MP3 file and returns XML as the output. Of course, writing the code to read ID3 tags by oneself requires some time, patience, and wading through a lot of documentation. Luckily, there are several libraries out there that will serve our purposes quite nicely. The one I have chosen is TagLib. If you&#39;re running debian getting tag lib is as simple as running:
<em>sudo apt-get install taglib-dev</em>
Now for some code:</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to skip all the includes and jump right into the meat.
[b]<em>Line 10-17</em>[/b]
This creates our TagLib object and parses the ID3 information for the file supplied to the function. This information is the output to the console.
[b]<em>Lines 25-28</em>[/b]
Checks to make sure a file was passed. If not it outputs a friendly usage guide and moves on. In actuality, since this will be later parsed by a PHP script, it would probably be a better idea to output an error code encapsulated in XML tags.
[b]<em>Lines 30-31</em>[/b]
Set up the XML file structure.
[b]<em>Lines 33-37</em>[/b]
Loop through every file passed and outputs the ID3 information for each.
[b]<em>Lines 39-40</em>[/b]
Close up and quit.
This script has a lot of obvious advantages. First of all is speed. Since it&#39;s being run on the server, where the files are kept, there is no waiting for the song to download to get the file info. Secondly, it can parse many files at one time making batch adds possible.
Well, that concludes part one of this tutorial. Next time we&#39;ll cover adding the songs to the database utilizing what was covered in this tutorial. We&#39;ll cover both scanning an existing library and a creating a front end for adding new songs. &#39;Til next time, happy coding.</p>

<p>Speaking of my work, be sure to check out the brand new portfolio section. It\&#39;s a little sparse now, but I will be filling it out with all my best work over the next few days. I encourage you to re-check out my motion graphics projects there as they are encoded in much higher quality than the YouTube versions (and it\&#39;s the only place you\&#39;ll be able to see the corrected <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/gallery/3">Crayola Commercial</a>) . Also, you get to use my snazzy new video player (written entirely in Flex).</p>
<p>Of course, the blog got a couple needed updates as well. Down at the bottom of the page you\&#39;ll notice page navigation. This is across the board for general viewing, viewing tags, and the archives. Another thing to get the page treatment was the entry comments. There\&#39;s only really <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows/">one entry</a> that can benefit from this update right now, but I hope to gain some more viewers by shifting my posts more towards industry related topics and some tutorials. Originally I was going to intersperse tweets between the posts but decided ultimately against it.</p>
<p>So, there it is. The site looks more awesome than ever and I\&#39;m hoping to bring some new sweet, juicy content to everybody. So, bookmark the site or add the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/dxprog">feed</a> to your favorite RSS reader and prepare for a new era of dxprog!</p>

Sadly, it wasn&#39;t a sci-fi convention as I would have liked, but an anime convention. I don&#39;t consider myself to be an anime nerd, and even border on disliking the genre entirely, but I did have a pretty good time none the less. The convention itself was fairly small in comparison to others, but there was still a goodly amount of things going on and plenty of dealers peddling their anime related wares.</p>
<p>The atmosphere or the con was... nerdy. Even so, I felt strangely out of place as I was one of the few attendees that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> cosplaying. Most of the costumes I didn&#39;t recognize, but there were the likes of Phoenix Wright, Yuna, Link and, surprisingly, several Snakes from Metal Gear:
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2767639648_eb81a44209.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image">
It still surprised me just how many girls were there. In fact, I&#39;d say the males were outnumbered by quite a bit which, for me, is an unusual situation to be in seeing as I go to school overflowing with testosterone. Just being around all these people was probably the most entertaining part of the day.</p>
<p>One of the areas we spent the most time in was the dealers floor. Just about anything anime related was being sold. Mangas, DVDs, T-shirts, action figures, plushies, costumes, weapons. And that&#39;s barely scratching the surface. As you can see in the picture above, I broke down and bought a Godot shirt. I wubs it!</p>
<p>There were some video games, including an NES championship tournament, but it was a side to everything else going on. There were rooms showing animes, people talking about how to improve your AMV/drawings, all sorts of crazy stuff. We wound up the night by sitting in on the &quot;Weakest Geek&quot; game show. It was kind of like Double Dare (sans the mess) and a quiz show with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire music playing in the background the entire time. The biggest part of this game was the &quot;Box&quot; game wherein a picture of an action figure would be shown and the player would then proceed to try to find said action figure in a fish tank filled with <em>more</em> action figures and packing peanuts. It was all rather entertaining to watch and the crew running the show was pretty cool.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to wrap this post up with a video I took while I was there (and later added music to).

<p>Now, I realize that the &quot;system specs&quot; spewed forth in the above video were probably intentionally skewed so as to follow the whacky, 80s style zaniness, but as an uber nerd and somebody who&#39;s intimately familiar with NES hardware, I feel compelled to correct their errors.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #1: 3.58Mhz video core clock speed</strong>
The NES video processor, a Ricoh 2C02 &quot;Picture Processing Unit&quot;, or PPU, is actually clocked at 5.37Mhz. The CPU is exactly one third of this, or 1.79Mhz. The figure they&#39;re quoting is the timing of a color NTSC signal.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #2: 240x226 resolution</strong>
The PPU actually worked with an internal resolution 256x240, though most old TVs did not display the first and last eight scanlines effectively making the resolution 256x224. This was the same for both NTSC and PAL models.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #3: 16 sprite pixel depth</strong>
I don&#39;t even know where to begin on this one. Firstly, the NES had enough sprite RAM (object attribute memory, or OAM) for 64, 8x8 or 8x16 sprites. Secondly, every sprite could have three colors (four if you include transparency) from a palette of 53 colors. Every scanline could hae a maximum of eight sprites, and when this limit was exceeded some sprites were not drawn causing the infamous flicker. Finally, you could have a total of 25 colors per scanline. What the hell they were talking about to begin with baffles me, but there were no 16s involved there at all. Except maybe that internal 16-bit PPU register that could be written to through dual writes to address $2006....</p>
<p><strong>Claim #4: NES has a Zilog Z80 processor</strong>
This one&#39;s easy. The NES did not have a Z80. It had a Ricoh 2A03, which was a 6502 without decimal mode and a set of sound instructions. The Gameboy, however, had a Z80 and the Sega Genesis used one as its sound processor.</p>
<p><strong>Claim #5 It&#39;s an 8-bit system</strong>
Well, that&#39;s about the only thing they got right. Though, the system did have a 16-bit address bus....</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m finished. I&#39;m sure somewhere God has smote a kitten for my nerdy rantingness, but it had to be said and I said it. Caio.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Fun with old computers</h2><time>July 29, 2008</time><div><p>Every once in a while I get a hankering for a hands on type project. Back in May that project was the <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/xbox-modding--an-epic-fight-an-epic-win/">Xbox mod</a>. This time around it was to build myself a new server after the last one I&#39;d been using overheated while I was away on vacation and the air conditioning was off (at least, that&#39;s my guess on the diagnosis). Of course, I would have liked to build something from scratch, but college funds being what they are that isn&#39;t always the most viable option. Instead, I took a trip up the the local TriftKo (yes, they spell it with a &quot;K&quot;) and picked up the cheapest (and at that time, only) computer they had. I really had no idea what kind of computer it was (though, I made a really close guess based on the ports on the back), but that didn&#39;t matter for my needs, namely, to run a web and file server.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a new computer I like to boot it in its &quot;virgin&quot; state to see what the computer is and what it was used for before it came into my possession (so far, I&#39;ve only found mild pron on one computer). After that, I take the thing apart and, dipping into the vast amounts of old computer parts available to me, upgrade it to make it as high tech as possible. After a long amount of research, trial and error, a BIOS upgrade, and some dabbling in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/grub4dos">GRUB for DOS</a> I was able to get the computer up to the following specs:</p>
<p>Pentium 166Mhz
64MB RAM
1.2GB Primary drive (still has Win98 on it)
4GB Secondary drive (running the latest Debian)
DVD-RW drive (which doesn&#39;t have any power since there are only two large molex adapters available)
Ethernet card
PCI USB 2.0 card</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a laughable computer to say the least and its age did prove to be more of an issue than I originally anticipated. The first was the inability to boot from CD even though the BIOS claimed to support it. I figured the old BIOS was the problem, so I set about trying to update it. Unlucky for me, IBM has pulled all BIOS upgrades for old systems off their site so I was stuck wading through forums. Once I got the BIOS upgraded it still wouldn&#39;t boot from CD, but it did correct an issue with identifying the 4GB drive (and now I have support for drives up to 8.4GB).</p>
<p>So, after all those many hours I was still unable to boot my Linux install CD. It was about then that I had the genius idea of copying the Linux kernel off of the install disc onto the Windows 98 drive and starting the installer in GRUB from DOS. Took a few tries to get off the ground, but it did wind up working. Things were looking great, then Linux took six or seven hours to install. I decided to sleep at this point.</p>
<p>Luckily, after Linux was installed and I got ssh up and running I could close the box, clean up the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/2716415642/">mess</a> that had appeared on the floor, and continue the finishing touches from the comfort of my laptop. Everything after that went pretty well, but there was still the issue of not being to use my 120GB hard drive full of stuff that I usually streamed to XBMC. Luckily, the fix for that was really, really simple. Buy a PCI USB card and use my external hard drive enclosure. For the first time in this entire project, and my entire time messing with Linux, it worked first crack out of the barrel without any extra configuration on my part (save changing my home directory mount in fstab).</p>
<p>So, it&#39;s been far more useful as of late, but I wanted to take it a step further. The box does have a sound card and seeing as it is sitting right next to my speaker system I figured &quot;Hey, why not use it as a stereo too?&quot; So, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing this evening. Getting the sound card to run was a bitch, especially with the little info I could find on the card itself. Looking through the startup messages it was being found as &quot;AT931 Audio 16&quot;. Google turned up two pages on that. It turns out the card is actually a OPTi 82c931, but even finding the correct module for that was a pain in the ass (it&#39;s snd-opti93x). After that, I followed <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-opti93x">this handy guide</a> on the AlsaProject wiki to get the rest up and running.</p>
<p>So now my computer plays sound which is pretty sweet. But, I&#39;m again being bitten in the ass by its age. If you try to do anything while playing an MP3, file access or an HTTP request, the audio starts lagging. So, I think I&#39;ve devised a clever way around said issue. I&#39;m going to write a series of scripts that will convert the MP3 to a wave file and play the wave (which requires almost no processor time). Couple that with a web interface for making playlists and it&#39;ll be the most kick ass twelve year old computer of all time.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Returning to my Roots</h2><time>July 14, 2008</time><div><p>They say all good things must come to an end. Such is true for my one week of summer vacation. It was brief, yet enjoyable. Got to celebrate my birthday with my family, eat grilled food and lots of potato salad, and also take the usual trip to Tulsa. It&#39;s a pity that it was so short, but I&#39;m complaining too much. The school is giving me a bachelor&#39;s degree in less than two years, so this time next year I&#39;ll be out of school. But that&#39;s a story for another day.</p>
<p>As you may <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/its-super-awesome-vacation-time/">recall</a>, last month began my two month long journey through the wonders of Flash. Last month focused primarily on Flash as it pertains to design, teaching us the interface, motion tweens, and just a hint of ActionScript. This month, however, is dedicated to nothing but ActionScript. To demonstrate these &quot;newly acquired skills&quot; our final project consists of making a game.</p>
<p>Now, I put &quot;newly acquired&quot; in quotes for a reason. For anybody who&#39;s frequented this blog long enough you should know by now that I am, or at least used to be, heavy into coding. Because of this I have an unfair advantage over the rest of the class in this regard and as such I am taking my project to ridiculous extents (far above the scope of the course). The nice thing, though, is that the instructor actually acknowledges the fact that I am as proficient as I am, so much so that I took the place of the lab instructor for one day (whilst the real one was waiting in line for his iPhone 3G). Being able to talk to the instructor about geeky stuff as equals is a nice departure. But, enough ego stroking, about the actual project itself.</p>
<p>I chose to challenge myself and create essentially a dumbed down clone of Street Fighter, but be completely extensible through external configuration files. The first thing I avoided was the use of graphics inside Flash itself opting instead to load sprite sheets from external sources. Everything is configured through XML sheets that define how a character should react, define where animations are within a sprite sheet, stages, etc. Amazingly, I&#39;ve achieved most of this and all very, very quickly. The biggest problem I foresee is the addition of enemy AI, but I&#39;ve got ideas on how to achieve this as well. Overall, though, I&#39;m loving being back at the helm of the coding ship. I&#39;d forgotten how much of a thrill can be derived from hours of typing if statements and nested for loops. Damn, it&#39;s good to be back.</p>

Today, the music of choice is Metal Gear Solid. I recently just finished the first one and as soon as I return from vacation will begin work on MGS2. If you have a PS2 and have not plaed any of these games I highly recommend picking up the recently released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Essential-Collection/dp/B001383L36/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1215198554&amp;sr=8-1">Essential Collection</a> as I did. Three games for thirty bucks is a really good deal for excellent games such as these. But anyways, on to the music.[break]</p>

</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s Super Awesome Vacation Time!</h2><time>June 25, 2008</time><div><p>Summer is here, and with it vacation. Unfortunately for us Full Sailors, we only get about a week of summer vacation (I get ten days because all my classes let out early). However, that&#39;s not to say I&#39;m not going to take advantage of the time off. Quite the contrary. Tomorrow I will be heading back to the good old midwest and chill with my folks. It&#39;s been over half a year since I&#39;ve seen them, so I&#39;m definitely looking forward to going back. I&#39;m especially looking forward to potato salad. Mmmmmm....</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, tomorrow is also one year from my graduation. It hardly seems like I&#39;ve been here for nine months, but there it is. It probably helps that I&#39;m usually pretty busy and that most of this is pretty fun. Though, I will admit, Flash was pretty boring. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed working on my projects, but they were small enough that I finished pretty quickly. And the last half of the course was a beginners guide to programming, something that I really don&#39;t need. So, while I did try to do more advanced things than what the project originally called for, there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of room to flex my muscles, as it were. You can check out my final project <a href="http://66.192.104.111/~mhackmann/ffm/project2">here</a>. Yes, it is an homage to <a href="http://www.egoraptor.net/">egoraptor&#39;s</a> series of awesomeness (who I had the great pleasure of helping recently). My other class this month was 3D modelling. That class was a lot of fun. The teacher was cool, the project was fun; I just enjoyed the entire class. I&#39;ll have my final project up on YouTube sometime soon.</p>
<p>In other news, I have begun and am about half way through animating a real Flash cartoon, one which will be entitled Phoenix Awesome. I hope to have it up on Newgrounds sometime over break.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about everything. I&#39;ll leave you with my MGP final project which I never actually posted on here. Enjoy</p>

One of the first video game songs I remember really enjoying was Gerudo Valley from Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64. Back when I had a crappy computer and little hard drive space, I would listen to MIDI files and Gerudo Valley was one of the few songs that had a pretty <a href="http://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/nintendo/n64/Z64gerud.mid">good version</a> out there. Of course, now that disk space isn&#39;t an issue, I&#39;ve moved on to MP3s. However, I still find myself listening to more <a href="http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00109/">remixes</a> than the actual original itself (because, let&#39;s face it, the N64 instrument library sucked). But, anyways, here are this weeks Gerudo Valley music picks.[break]</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Xbox Modding - An Epic Fight, An Epic Win</h2><time>June 4, 2008</time><div><p>The internet has and continues to change the way society operates. The biggest thing the internet has going for it is instant availability for anything you could ever want. Be it from news, to sports, to knowledge, whatever, it&#39;s out there and waiting to be accessed whenever your heart desires. It&#39;s no surprise that this on demand media is killing the mediums of old: radio, newspapers, magazines, etc. However, the one that seems to be taking a hit the most, recently, is television. Why wait for a show to come on when you can just watch it on the internet whenever you want? Okay, this isn&#39;t really about the philosophies of the internet, but it seemed a nice segue into a recent project of mine.</p>
<p>For anybody who&#39;s perused the geek community long enough, you&#39;ve probably heard of console modding. The act of taking a console and breaking it&#39;s will so that it becomes your little bitch and does whatever you say. I&#39;ve done this before, most notably with the PS2 and the DS. I&#39;d been using my PS2 to watch videos, but the media programs out there for it are nowhere near as extensive and awesome as <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/">Xbox Media Center (XBMC)</a>. This program is truly amazing. It is, by far, the best media center program in existance (yes, it trumps Windows Media Center and Front Row). XBMC has it all: support for more video codecs than actually exist, a beautiful interface, a robust scripting engine (a la Python), and it&#39;s open source to boot. It was this promise of media tranquility that pushed me to purchase a second hand Xbox ($60 from GameStop) and take a shot at modding its brains out. What I didn&#39;t realize, was that the road that lay before me was a long and bumpy one.</p>
<p>There are many ways to mod your Xbox, but all of them fall under two categories: modchipping and softmod. Modchipping (a word that I honestly just made up) is the act of actually soldering a chip to your Xbox that overrides it&#39;s flash bios and runs its own software. Having no soldering skills, I decided to go the safer route and did a soft mod. There are a goodly amount of softmods out there, but I used a combo of a game save exploit and hot swapping to get the job done. Hot swapping, in this case, is the act of swapping the IDE cable of the Xbox hard drive to hook it up to your PC so you can read and write files to it. It has to be done while the Xbox is running becase the drive is locked and only the Xbox that its shipped with can unlock it. I may post a condensed quide to the approach I used later, but here begins (finally) the sordid tale of my three days of agony.</p>
<p>Actuallt, I lied. A little more exposition is needed. The reason I chose to do a hot swap mod instead of the safer transfer a game save to the Xbox via USB drive was due solely to impatience. I would have needed to buy an adapter with which to hook up my fash drive which would mean ordering from some shady mod chip store online, waiting a week or two for delivery and I just didn&#39;t want to wait that long. Plus, being a guy whose messed with computer hardware before, I was pretty confident in my ability to pull this off.</p>
<p>So, I got home from buying my Xbox and set to work immediately. I was only a minute into the operation when I ran into my first major problem: the Xbox had torx screws, and I was fresh out of torx screwdrivers. So, instead of bugging my room mate to take back to the store to aquire said screwdrivers, I did what I usually do in this situation: find something else. In this case, I used the spare keys for my bike chain. A few minutes and torn up fingers later, the top came off and I was ready to do the swap.</p>
<p>Being that I only have a laptop, I couldn&#39;t plug the hard drive directly into my computer. As such, I had to go through a USB enclosure. This itself presented a myriad of problems, though I didn&#39;t realize it at the time. Perusing the intewebs had told me that I needed a program called hdd_driver to copy my stuff to the drive. So, going through the usual channels, I acquired myself a copy of that and was greeted by five thousand missing DLL errors. So, instead I decided to look for an alternative. The next thing I came across was a Linux distro with built-in FatX support (the file system type of Xbox). Attempting to use this raised one issue, though: it would only recognize drives plugged into an IDE channel (hda). Being that I&#39;ve had some experience with various virtual machines, I knew <a href="http://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a> emulated this. So, I set up my environment and booted. However, I was greeted with &quot;Xbox partitions not found&quot;.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but I was not going about unlocking my drive properly at the time. Getting this done correctly is something that requires fast movements and, when you&#39;ve bricked the dashboard, precise timing. Once I realized this and had gotten the drive recognized, I attempted to install my exploit (which was, at that time, a fonts exploit and not the game save one) via a handy little install script that came with the Linux distro. How nice is that? What I didn&#39;t realize at this point was that though my drive was recognized and could be read from, writing was not working correctly. So, this script did it&#39;s thing: it went and formatted the C drive and replaced all the dashboard files with the hacked versions... or at least tried to.</p>
<p>It came back with a few &quot;unable to copy&quot; errors which unnerved me a little, but I reconnected my Xbox correctly and booted it up only to be greeted by the ambiguous error 21. My dashboard was completely unbootable and with it so shrank my window of opportunity to hot swap while the drive was still unlocked. After about twenty or so tries I finally managed to get a good swap again and found that my C drive was in ruins... and there wasn&#39;t anything I could do about it. Everything I tried to do resulted in &quot;Unable to copy. Read-only file system.&quot; At this point I thought it was because it couldn&#39;t delete the gibberish files that had been written from the script I had run. So, I decided to wait until the next day and pick up a copy of Splinter Cell and use the game save exploit for it.</p>
<p>So, I picked up Splinter Cell and proceeded to get the files necessary. After some time I managed to get a succesful swap again, erased my E drive (where the save games are stored) and attempted to copy over the data. I was again greeted with ominous &quot;Read-only file system&quot; error. I spent the rest of that day and most of the next basically doing the same thing: turn on Xbox, swap the drive, attempt to copy, fail, change something, rinse and repeat. Nothing worked, and I was afraid that I&#39;d just wasted sixty bucks on a console that could only play games. Needless to say, I got really good at swapping the drive.</p>
<p>I was about to give up when I decided to blame something other than the Linux distro I was running. I decided to do two things: swap differently, and use a different IDE cable. The cable I had been using was a one device, 40-wire cable. I moved up to a two device, 80-wire cable and unplugged the DVD drive from the Xbox as well. By unplugging the DVD drive I gave myself a larger window of opportunity to swap as the system will fail that before it checks the hard drive. So, after I&#39;d done this I went through the usual paces and, lo and behold, files were copied. To say I was ecstatic would be an understatement. With the exploit running and the FTP server working, I now had an easy way to transfer my files to and from the box and the rest went down pretty easily (there was one more minor hiccup, but something that I figured out pretty quickly).</p>
<p>So, now my Xbox is fully modded and running XBMC, and it is really freakin&#39; sweet. All the pain and emotional anguish I suffered had finally paid off, and I now have cable television for the price of my internet connection and a one time fee of $60.</p>

Back in August of 1992, Nintendo released unto the world the little gem known as Mario Paint. Bundled with it&#39;s own mouse Mario Paint was the equivalent of Adobe Creative Suite for the Super Nintendo. You could draw pictures, do animations, and it even came with a nifty little mouse based game called Gnat Attack. However, Mario Paint&#39;s legacy lies not in it&#39;s visual abilities (though it inspired a certain <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">internet cartoon</a>). No, Mario Paint is all about its music creating abilities and the amount of high quality Mario Paint remixes on YouTube is absolutely astounding. Narrowing it down to three videos was a challenge not only because of the sheer volume of videos out there, but there are two guys who have the lions share and I wanted to give everybody a chance. Oh, and Mario Paint Composer doesn&#39;t count. But, enough rambling, enjoy![break]</p>

<p>Some time ago, video game news site <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/">Joystiq</a> began a weekly <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/tag/musicday/">series of posts</a> highlighting video game music as performed by the YouTube community. For some reason unbeknownst to me they no longer do this. So in the spirit of all things game and music related, I bring you Game Music Friday. Every week I will select a theme or game and show three videos from YouTube pertaining to said topic. The only stipulation being that the music must be performed or arranged by the community. That means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_music_video">AMVs</a> are out. If you have any suggestions for videos or a topic, please leave a comment below and I&#39;ll be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I bring to you the first Game Music Friday, the topic of choice being Dr. Mario. Enjoy![break]</p>

However, instead of doing a complete redesign I&#39;ve decided to just improve the functionality. First off, you&#39;ll notice that the main content stuff is much wider now. Very tasty. Even tastier than that, though, is how the side bars are now organized.

</div></article><article><h2>Updates and what not</h2><time>May 6, 2008</time><div><p>It seems that since I began school this blog has gotten more and more deserted. I was reading through old entries last night and I feel that things may be beginning to get empty. So, here I am once again poring forth my soul into the void that is known as the internet.</p>
<p>Last month ended my two month journey that was motion graphics. I am sad to have to leave these classes as I seem to have found my calling in mograph. To be frank, I had way too much fun and I probably created my best work ever in those two months. Of course, just because I&#39;m not in the class doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be dropping it and forgetting about it. No, I plan on doing small projects through out school that I can dump into my demo reel down. Even now I am working on a small advertisement for a friend. After that, there&#39;s a Dockers &quot;make your commercial and have it aired on TV&quot; contest that I&#39;m thinking of entering. The more I can get my work out there, the more chance I have of going immediately into the industry after I graduate.</p>
<p>But enough dwelling on the past (or the future), and let us reflect on the present. This month I have probably what is going to be the easiest class off all time: web development. For anybody who doesn&#39;t know me personally, I&#39;ve been involved in web dev for going on eight years. All that YPN stuff and what not. Of course, for those of us who are already fluent in web dev they&#39;re going to try to get us to use modern and clean coding practices (tableless design, emphasis on CSS, etc). Oh, wait. I already do all that. I feel like a jerk talking about this class like it&#39;s useless crap, but it&#39;s really not their fault. However, I don&#39;t want to be talked down to as if I know nothing or am new to the whole web stuff. As with most technologies I&#39;ve taught myself, I not only learn forwards, but backwards as well. I&#39;m well versed in tricks of old as well as new. Alright, enough of that borderline ego stroking.</p>
<p>My other class, which I haven&#39;t actually attended yet, is, or will be, developmental psychology. I really don&#39;t know what this class has in store for me, but at the very least it should be more interesting than web dev.</p>
<p>Today, I got to get my feet wet in the field of game testing. EA&#39;s Tiburon division, which develops most of their sports titles, resides just seven small miles from my house. Once or twice a month they bring people in to do a couple hours of game beta testing in exchange for a free game. I&#39;ve been on the mailing list since December after Ian Cummings, lead director of the Madden series, put in a recommendation for me after reading my Rock Band drums post. Of course, that was for a full-time job doing game testing, but being a full-time student as well these two hours sessions were the next best thing. But, I digress.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got to go to the EA building, which I must say is very, very nice looking. I even got to sign a non-disclosure agreement that forbids me from telling anybody what I played or what I saw. Kind of cool, actually. I will say, I enjoyed what I played and the best part of all is I obtained myself a free copy of Command &amp; Conquer 3 for PC. I haven&#39;t actually installed or tried the game yet, but I&#39;ll probably post something when I do.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that about wraps things up for now. I&#39;ll be putting up a post about my final project for motion graphics soon (currently waiting on something). Oh, and for all those tiny little updates be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dxprog">Twitter account</a>. I&#39;ve also placed a convenient little box above the RSS feeds that shows my latest tweet. Until next time, keep your staplers running.</p>

<p>Not going to put a whole bunch of useless text on this one, however I will explain things a bit. This is yet another project for motion graphics. The criteria on this one was to create a commercial for a demographic outside of my own. So, I decided to market Full Sail to women (because we don&#39;t have near enough). Enjoy.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Little Motion Graphics to Bring Out the Nostalgia</h2><time>April 3, 2008</time><div><p>I&#39;ve wrapped up my first month of motion graphics (MGR), and with it I finished my sixth month of school. Hard to believe it&#39;s already been half a year. Time does fly when you&#39;re having fun. But that&#39;s hardly why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>For MGR, our final project was to create a magazine layout and thirty second animation for a product, service, etc. I had a few ideas for mine before settling on something that was close to me: Crayola crayons. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve never really touched much on my artistic background, but I&#39;ve always had a box of Crayons crayons handy. I can remember buying crayons with my birthday money (it was the only time I ever had any) many times. Also, whenever we&#39;d take a trip to visit my grandparents I&#39;d always be drawing stuff with a bowl of crayons that my Grandma would set out. Even now, sitting next to me on my desk is a box of 64 Crayolas, and they&#39;re not unused either. And, for the record, those other brands aren&#39;t really crayons. Crayola&#39;s have a distinct smell, texture, and feel that has not been duplicated by anybody else. I don&#39;t mind spending a little extra for them. Upon opening the box and getting a whiff, I am suddenly a little kid, lying on the floor doodling and day dreaming away as only the innocent can.</p>
<p>But, enough of the schmaltzy stuff. Before you can watch the video you must see the ad. It kind of sets the mood.</p>

<p>As of the beginning of this month I began my foray into the wondrous world that is motion graphics. Our first project was to make a ten second bumper advertising ourselves or a &quot;company&quot; that represented ourselves. I was originally going to use my name and try to brand myself as myself, but it was advised by an instructor that I brand myself under a pseudonym, at least for the remainder of school, so as to have something that gives a lasting impression. I decided to play off of my more or less established internet moniker, dxprog, and came up with dx productions. Grab yourself some popcorn and prepare to be sold my awesomeness.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Internet Rule #48 is Defined Herein</h2><time>February 12, 2008</time><div><p>If you&#39;ve been around the internet as much as I have you&#39;ll probably know that it has it&#39;s own set of rules. Of these rules, #34 is most famous. Rule #34 states:</p>
<p><strong>If it exists, there is porn of it.</strong></p>
<p>Unwanted results from an innocent Google image search is enough to say that this rule is nearly one hundred percent true. However, there is no definition for something that&#39;s even more true than rule #34 (luckily, it&#39;s also more safe for work). I hereby decree that Internet Rule #48 will be defined as:</p>
<p><strong>If it exists, there is anime of it.</strong></p>
<p>This rule can be nearly solely confirmed by one website: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a>. For anybody who has never really scoured the annals of dA, it should be noted that almost 90% of everything posted is anime or some lame attempt at anime. A good chunk of this is fan art of just about anything. It doesn&#39;t matter what TV show, movie, comic, game, or person it is or is from. If they exist, somebody has drawn it in anime form. Let&#39;s get to proving using five examples from each stated category.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Video Games Live - Something for Everybody</h2><time>January 31, 2008</time><div><p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/bumpers/VGL.png" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>I had the great fortune of being able to attend a <a href="http://www.videogameslive.com/">Video Games Live</a> (VGL) concert. For the uninitiated, VGL is a concert where game music is played. Some people may think it&#39;s nerdy, however, but I see it as something that can be appreciated by gamers and non-gamers alike.</p>
<p>People see the words &quot;video game music&quot; and probably automatically think of the bleeps and bloops (more accurately, triangle and square waves) of the Atari and NES days of yore. These may not have sounded great, but because of the limitations more effort was placed on making themes easily recognizable and pronounced (i.e. Mario, Zelda, Metroid). However, since the days of the SNES, video game music has been approached more like a movie score. At the forefront of this movement was Nobuo Uematsu and his work in the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy serves as an excellent demonstration of the similarities between game and movie music. Final Fantasy VI, and SNES game mind you, has one of the best scores of any game. Each character has their own theme, or leitmotif, and these themes are woven throughout every piece of music in the game. The same went for FFX, though the motifs weren&#39;t character specific, but specific to certain cultural elements. Star Wars takes this kind of approach: the Empire has a theme, the Force has a theme, etc. It&#39;s this kind of music that has the ability to evoke emotions in the listener and, at its core, that&#39;s what music is all about.</p>
<p>Of course, not all game scores are orchestral. Koji Kondo dabbles in a little bit of everything, and there are rock and techno type stuff out there. I lean towards the orchestral myself because I find it to be more powerful. I will admit that most of my childhood was spent listening the classical music and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams">John Williams</a> and as such I have a soft spot for this kind of music, but I know die hard fans of vastly different genres who appreciate the vocals of Halo or the trumpet heavy Zelda. Even my mom, a dedicated 80s gal, enjoys much of my game music library.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. The conception that game music is various beeps and just for nerds is a complete fallacy. Video game music these days can be just as powerful, if not more so, than latest blockbuster. At that, it can be appreciated by all walks of life. And I think it should be.</p>
<p>Oh, the concert was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9npt7JaVmLI">awesome</a> (I scream before the rest of the crowd at about 0:31).</p>
<p>(Like the bumper at the top? I&#39;m going to start including these in more of my posts as a design challenge for myself.)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Wherein the Author Imparts Upon His Audience the Ongoings of His Life</h2><time>January 22, 2008</time><div><p>It&#39;s been some time since I have updated this blog. So I take leave of my busy life, if only for a moment, to fill you, the reader, in on the various happenings and goings on. (Okay, that&#39;s enough eighteen hundreds talk).</p>
<p>So, Christmas has come and gone (as it always does) and I am now back into the thick of school. Luckily, I don&#39;t have all sucky courses this month. No, I only have one. However, let&#39;s put the good news before the bad, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>ADG</strong>
Advanced Computer Graphics, or ADG, is probably the second best course I&#39;ve had thus far (<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/into-the-christmas-swing-amongst-other-things/">NOS</a> being number one). ADG is, more or less, a Photoshop/Illustrator class. DCG was also this to a slight degree, but more emphasis was placed on the actual design as opposed to technical issues. Now, however, we&#39;re in the thick of opacity masks, and layer styles, and blah, blah, blah. Actually, believe it or not, I&#39;ve become more comfortable in Illustrator than I am in Photoshop. The pen tool, simply put, is the most brilliant thing since aged cheese. But don&#39;t take my word for it, take my art:</p>
<p>[gallery=NES]<img src="http://img00.deviantart.net/244b/i/2008/021/2/e/nes_vector_illustration_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="An NES created using nothing but vector shapes"><img src="http://img09.deviantart.net/07b2/i/2008/021/3/1/nes_advertisment_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="Using the image from before and placing it into an ad.">[/gallery]</p>
<p>It should be duly noted that the NES is not, in fact, a photograph. Nor was it some fancy job I did in Photoshop. No, it was done completely in Illustrator and, vector graphics being what they are, is infinitely scalable. The advertisement, however, is not. Oh, and speaking of which, I realize that the NES is pushing twenty-three.</p>
<p>My other course is geometry and I will leave you simply with this: proofs can burn in Hell.</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;d like to say real quick: iPod Touch is the best PDA ever created. I know. I own one. Damn you Apple, damn you.</p>
<p>My site is still riding on a wave of hits from the Rock Band drums thing way back when, but I&#39;ve had another surge in popularity thanks to <a href="http://andrewrudson.com/main.php">this guy</a>. He&#39;s created one nicely polished drum kit app and has kindly linked back to my page. It&#39;d be wrong for me not to return the favor.</p>
<p>Finally, while I&#39;m throwing out links, be sure to check out the newly revamped <a href="http://www.game-boyz.net/">Game Boyz</a>. While you&#39;re at it, why don&#39;t you sign up on the forums and tell my bro how awesome the comic is.</p>
<p>Well, that should appease the masses for the well being. I write these posts in hope that somebody is reading them, however, even if it just serves as a chronicle of my life for me to read later, then so be it. It&#39;s deep tomes of history have already provided me with hours of cringing agony. May it continue to do so in this grand a glorious new year.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>2007 - A Year in Gaming</h2><time>December 30, 2007</time><div><p>2007 was, indeed, a monumental year in gaming. So many triple A titles, ninety-nine percent of which were released in the holiday season making it very expensive for those who wanted to stay on top. Today I&#39;m going to take a look back at gaming in 2007 (the games I have played, at least).</p>
<h2 id="wii">Wii</h2>
<p><strong>Wario Ware: Smooth Moves</strong>
This was my first foray into the world that is Wario Ware and, as such, cannot compare it to previous entries in the series. For the uninformed, Wario Ware is a collection of micro games, meaning each little game has one goal and you have about five (or less) seconds to complete said goal. The folks at Nintendo got incredibly inventive and this game shows off the abilities of the Wiimote excellently. As far as looks go there isn&#39;t anything jaw dropping, but the art direction can be hilarious at times and it certainly fits in with the zany, face paced style of the game. I only wish there were some better multiplayer options especially since this is a great party game (especially when over zealous players put their hand through a ceiling fan).
8/10 Stars</p>
<p><strong>Super Paper Mario</strong>
Previous entries in the Paper Mario series have been more RPGish in that battles were turn based and you traversed the world in three dimensions. Super Paper Mario takes a more unique approach, cleverly blending old school platforming with RPG elements. There is, of course, the flip element to the game which makes you look at everything in a whole new perspective (forgive the pun). About the only caveat to this game would be the mansion level, but the clever puzzles mixed with awesome writing make this a must have game for the Wii.
8/10 Stars</p>
<p><strong>Super Mario Galaxy</strong>
I will admit, I do not own this nor have I played it much. However, in my time with it I can see how it has gotten such high praise. The visuals alone are simply beautiful, I&#39;d say the best looking of any game made this year. The music is a joy to listen to with many motifs going back to the days of Mario 3 and some Mario 64 selections as well. Most of it is orchestrated which makes it all the better. The best thing is, these are only the icing on an extremely delicious cake. The game play is simply fantastic. Gravity plays a huge role in the mechanics of this game and you had best be keeping that in mind whilst traversing the spherical levels. There&#39;s really not much to say about this game aside from that it&#39;s everything a Mario game should be.
10/10 Stars</p>
<h2 id="xbox-360">Xbox 360</h2>
<p><strong>Crackdown</strong>
This is probably the must underrated game of the year. If you bought this game just for the Halo 3 beta, raise your hand. (raises hand) If that&#39;s the only reason you bought this game and never even played it, then you should be ashamed of yourself. I was originally going to pass on Crackdown and the Halo 3 beta, but after playing the demo I realized that it (Crackdown) was a really cool game. I&#39;ve never played a sandbox game before and just the ability to go wherever and do whatever I wanted was awesome enough. Throw in being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and run faster than your mom and you&#39;ve got one sweet game. The ending does suck, but story isn&#39;t the most prominent aspect so I&#39;ll let it slide. I spent many a good hour with this game.
7/10 Stars</p>
<p><strong>Eternal Sonata</strong>
Eternal Sonata was supposed to be the Final Fantasy for Xbox 360, at least in my eyes. It was simply gorgeous and it had an awesome battle system, however it is missing the one crucial element that a good RPG needs: story. I haven&#39;t played very far into this game because, quite frankly, I don&#39;t care about the characters. In games such as Final Fantasy VI or X there was enough story to keep me going to find out what happened. The problem with ES is that no real story has been setup after a few hours of play. There&#39;s been a little bit of character exposition, but not much compelling me to play through.
6/10 Stars</p>
<p><strong>Halo 3</strong>
By far the most hyped game of the year, luckily it delivers. There really isn&#39;t much of a difference from the previous games, but enough of an evolution for me to say that it is the best looking, best playing Halo out there. Multiplayer still rocks, they brought back the assault rifle, and the addition of multiplayer match replays is very sweet. If you are a 360 owner and haven&#39;t bought this yet, you need to do some deep soul searching and then go and buy it.
8/10 Stars</p>
<p><strong>Rock Band</strong>
Rock Band, aka Drum Hero or the Real Guitar Hero III, is by far the best rhythm game ever. Guitar Hero was awesome, but there&#39;s not much room left for innovation in that game outside of new songs. I don&#39;t know if this is what Harmonix was thinking or not, but they definitely upped the ante with Rock Band. Guitar is more or less the same, same for vocals if you&#39;ve played Sing Star or Karaoke Revolution, but the drums is an entirely different beast. Getting all your limbs to work separately from each other can be a challenge, albeit a very satisfying one once you get the hang of it. In terms of song selection, there should be something for everyone especially with new downloadable tracks coming every week. The only thing about Rock Band is that, as the name suggests, you really have to play it with other people. Playing the solo tour is fun and all, but the multiplayer is where it&#39;s at. Paying attention to our band mates and saving them (or vice versa) adds an extra element to the game. The most awesome part, though, is when your singer can&#39;t sing. It can be hilarious and horrible... all at the same time.
10/10 Stars</p>
<h2 id="nintendo-ds">Nintendo DS</h2>
<p><strong>Phoenix Wright: Justice for All</strong>
The Phoenix Wright series was already fairly well established by the time I got to it. I originally a half ass purchase as a game to play on my flight to Orlando in May. It turned out to be one of the best things I bought this year. Phoenix Wright was like an interactive Encyclopedia Brown story, only with killing and stuff. The stories are so intriguing that it is hard to put them down, and when you do finish you are saddened because the awesome ride you were just on ended. Graphically there&#39;s not much to see, though the artwork is nice. If you&#39;re into thinking type games you should definitely pick this one up.
9/10 Stars</p>
<p><strong>The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass</strong>
Zelda&#39;s first foray onto the Nintendo DS brought some radical changes to gameplay; namely, a game controlled entirely by the stylus. As bad as that may seem it works amazingly well. The game&#39;s visuals and sound are near identical to its predecessor, the Wind Waker. Despite all this, I felt the game was somewhat lacking and felt very scaled down. Granted, this is a protable release and the target audience was newcomers, but it still took away some of that Zelda feel. However, they still could&#39;ve made some better music for the dungeons.
7/10 Stars</p>
<h2 id="portal">Portal</h2>
<p>Just yesterday I picked up a copy of the Orange Box. Five games for fifty dollars is simply too good of a deal to pass up. At this point in time I have only installed/played/completed Portal. Portal is, by far, one of the most awesome games I&#39;ve played in some time. The concept is insanely clever and forces you to think in a vastly different way. The writing is top notch and there were several things that I laughed out loud at. My only problem is that the game was far too short. I completed it in a few hours. Luckily there are advanced maps to complete yet and hopefully some stuff made by the community that I can get later.
9/10 Stars</p>
<p>If I had to pick one of these as my number one game of 2007 I would have to go with Rock Band. The drums are simply awesome and having a whole bunch of people doing co-op play makes for an awesome time. I would have to say Mario Galaxy would come in at a close second. It&#39;s awesome on too many fronts not to give honorable mention.</p>
<p>Well, there you have it. 2008 alredy looks to be promising with Brawl coming up right off the bat. Hopefully we&#39;ll see the same amount o quality games, but maybe released over a longer period of time. Happy New Year and keep gaming.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>So many all nighters</h2><time>December 22, 2007</time><div><p>It&#39;s true; I have pulled an insane amount of all nighters this year and here I am doing it once again. I am currently at Orlando International where I await the departure of my flight at 6:23am, a little less than six hours from now. I was hoping to walk in here, dump off my luggage, and get through security right off the bat. However, good old Northwest Airlines has, yet again, left me with an unmanned counter. So, I am stuck with my twenty pound bag of clothing and vigilantly watching for the first signs of life at the counter.</p>
<p>Once again I have finished another two courses at Full Sail. This time was Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Math (CMD) which was basically an Algebra course.</p>
<p>DAT was alright; it was essentially a traditional art course with design centric properties. Not being able to use my computer was difficult for me especially because pencils and paper don&#39;t have the Ctl+Z option. If you screw up, you&#39;ve screwed up. Congratulations. However, I did pump out some decent stuff which I will show to you now.</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Rock-Band-Still-Life-72758916]![](http://www.deviantart.com/download/72758916/Rock_Band_Still_Life_by_dxprog.jpg">http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Rock-Band-Still-Life-72758916]![](http://www.deviantart.com/download/72758916/Rock_Band_Still_Life_by_dxprog.jpg</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url]
This is my fice piece still life. I pushed it a little bit by counting the drum sticks as seperate objects, but meh. It went ungraded anyways (as did most things in that class).</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Master-Chief-in-the-Moonlight-72758650]![](http://www.deviantart.com/download/72758650/Master_Chief_Painting_by_dxprog.jpg">http://dxprog.deviantart.com/art/Master-Chief-in-the-Moonlight-72758650]![](http://www.deviantart.com/download/72758650/Master_Chief_Painting_by_dxprog.jpg</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url]
This is the only piece I am truly proud of. I don&#39;t really have much to say aside from it was painted with acrylics on canvas and it was my first time doing any painting outside of using Crayola watercolors. The colors are a little dark because mixing paints is a bitch.</p>
<p>I did do several other pieces, but I don&#39;t have pictures of them and seeing as I&#39;m at the airport I won&#39;t be taking pictures anytime soon.</p>
<p>Nothing really to report on about math because that&#39;s exactly what it was. What is sweet, though, is that I may pull an A out of that class which would thrill me to no end as I thought math was my suckiest subject.</p>
<p>So, there&#39;s my month on a nutshell. I&#39;ll probably post again once I&#39;m in ol&#39; Bartlesville. Until then, keep on peacin&#39; out!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Welcome to Relaunch 5.0!</h2><time>December 20, 2007</time><div><p>Not sure if that version number is correct or not, but it seems about right.</p>
<p>So, yes, here is the new design. It&#39;s not the same one I was working on <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/redesign-the-reason/">back in October</a>. No, it&#39;s better. I was actually going to use this for my final project in Fabian&#39;s class (NOS), but he borked his server and essentially axed the entire set up a blog requirement. I do owe him a lot for this design as it was his, shall we say, technique that inspired me. Design aside, this is the easiest transition to new design/engine I&#39;ve ever had (thanks in no small part to the fact that I reused the current database structure).</p>
<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to blog right now. I&#39;m going to be returning to good old Bartlesville for Christmas in a few days. Perhaps I&#39;ll write something then. In case I don&#39;t say it in time, I hope everybody has a Kick Ass Christmas!</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, I added tagging. Maybe I&#39;ll add a tag cloud later.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Site upgrades: Now with more caching</h2><time>December 3, 2007</time><div><p>I have culled some scripting from my WIP site to add database caching support to the current scripts. I&#39;ve been noticing lately that the database has been having trouble keeping up with the higher demand so that is why I rushed this out the door. Overall things are much faster, however, information is only pulled from the database once an hour so there&#39;s going to be a delay between, say, somebody adding a comment and it actually showing up on the page.

In the last post I said I was going to make a GlovePIE script, but it seems I have been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIre8qkQIvs">beaten to the punch</a>. You&#39;ll find the script in the description of the linked video and I can confirm that it works with the 360 drum kit.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Good-bye vacation</h2><time>November 26, 2007</time><div><p>A wise man once said all good things must come to an end. So it is true for me as my week long Thanksgiving vacation is over effective 8:00AM EST tomorrow morning. However, I will certainly say that it has been a rather interesting week for me.</p>
<p>There is, of course, my <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/hack-rock-band-drums-to-work-with-windows-marvel-at-them-working-with-windows-55562.phtml">obvious</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/23/use-the-rock-band-drums-with-your-pc/">return</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/22/rock-band-drum-kit-hacked-for-windows/">to</a> <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/clip/rock-band-drums-work-on-pc-326030.php">fame</a> thanks in no small part to idle curiosity and a couple minutes of nifty text editing. And to those who&#39;ve been messing around with the drums program from the prior post, I have been paying attention to your comments. At this point I&#39;ve abandoned that program in lieu of a GlovePIE script. More on that as things unfold.</p>
<p>An interesting development that spun off of all that hype was a small little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/welcome-to-the-brawl-of-the-century/#comments">comment</a> left on a completely unrelated topic. It was from a producer at EA who basically said &quot;Hey, want to do some game testing now and maybe come work for us after college?&quot; When I first read that my small appartment was filled with whooping and jumping (this was before I got sick, more on that in a minute). It would be completely awesome if this were to pan out for me. Not only would I get some extra cash on the side while still in school, but I could go straight from graduation right into the industry that I&#39;ve always dreamed of working in.</p>
<p>This whole thing is a perfect testimony to what I&#39;ve been told by many people: throw yourself out there, you never know who&#39;s looking. I&#39;ve been slowly working on my online presence since I joined YPN in January of &#39;02. Since then I&#39;ve dipped into almost every kind of online media there is. From running a message board, to podcasting, to online videos. Basically what I&#39;m trying to say is, if you&#39;ve got something that you think is good, put up online and do a little bit of shameless advertising. If I can come this far with one little video and a tip suggestion to Engadget and Joystiq there&#39;s no reason why anybody else can&#39;t. /end soapbox moment</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, I am &quot;sick&quot;. I put it in quotes because it&#39;s not as bad as my usual form of sickness. Usually I get a sore throat, runny, feel weak, and just downright terrible over all. This, however, is confined mainly to the sore throat combined with a little bit of hoarse voice. Luckily, with the exception of the throat I feel physically fine. I was well enough to bike up to school today to pick up the books for my next wave of classes, namely Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Mathematics (CMD).</p>
<p>DAT looks to be rather interesting as it is basically a traditional art class (no computers) with a design oriented twist. I&#39;ve heard from two sources now that we&#39;re going to be getting a large amount of art supplies so that&#39;ll be cool. CMD is basic math up through intermediate Algebra. I jumped to the middle of my book and was able to figure out what was going on so I&#39;m feeling pretty confident about that. Plus, I got a free Algebric calculator, though I doubt I&#39;ll ever use it. I usually do all my problem solving on paper.</p>
<p>Well, I feel I&#39;ve rambled on enough. Before I go I just want to give a quick shout out to any new readers I may have picked up through the hulla-balloo. Peace out.</p>

<p>Answers to common questions:</p>
<p><strong>Does this work for PS2 or PS3 controllers?</strong>
No. This driver is for Xbox 360 compliant controllers. Seeing as I don&#39;t have either of those, I don&#39;t know their level of support.</p>
<p><strong>Do the Xbox 360 work on the PS3/PS2 version (or vica versa)</strong>
More than likely not, but once again I don&#39;t have anything to test it out with.</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;re not a hacker. I plugged mine in and it just worked.</strong>
Not really a question, but: 
A) I had old drivers when I did this (Nov &#39;07). The old drivers didn&#39;t support anything outside of Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers. The newer drivers have been rewritten to support third party contrllers.</p>
<p>B) Hacker is (or was) a synonym for programmer, so once again, you&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>I have a problem with my computer. Can you fix it?</strong>
Being a full-time college student I don&#39;t have time to attend to every little problem. There&#39;s an internet full of willing people who are much smarter than I and have far more time.</p>
<p><strong>No time? But you made this! You obviously have no life!</strong>
I made this in half an hour (video included). And it was over Thanksgiving break at that. You, my fine sir, troll the internet telling people they have no life when it is in fact <em>you</em> that have no life. Seriously, go and get yourself a girlfriend. Once again, you lose.</p>
<p>Okay, enough poking fun at people. I hope this brings all the confusion and chaos to a close.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Into the Christmas Swing (amongst other things)</h2><time>November 13, 2007</time><div><p>We&#39;re almost down to one month before Christmas. THis means many different things to many different people. For some it means shopping, others getting together with others. For me, it means Christmas music. <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/dxprog/charts/?charttype=recenttracks">A lot of Christmas music</a>. Of course, it also means that I&#39;ll be able to go see my folks again which is always sweet. And let&#39;s not forget the tantalizing aroma of sweet Christmas presents under the tree. And, speaking of aroma, and possibly the most important part of Christmas, the cookies. But, I suppose we must get through Thanksgiving first, which for me means being thankful for my brand new copy of Rock Band that I will be playing on that day.</p>
<p>But, holidays aside, I&#39;ve been working on some very interesting things for school as of late. I&#39;ve already given you a taste by showing my trailer project, but there are many other things I&#39;ve been up to. Let&#39;s list them by class.</p>
<p><strong>Designing Computer Graphics (DCG)</strong>
So far this class has been mostly about Illustrator and Photoshop basics, though they have touched on some good design practices (or not so good) by reviewing previous students works. However, there are three core projects we&#39;re working on (of which only two have been assigned so far). The first was a black and white logo.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Pixelated_Earth.png" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Our second project was a set of three (or more) icons based around a theme. There were six possible themes to choose from, those being Olympics, zoo, theme park, library, airport, or musical styles. I&#39;ll let you figure out which theme I chose.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Icons_Template.png" alt="" title="image">
First I need to note that that is not my logo (it is the official logo of the 2012 Summer Olympic games). It&#39;s primarily there to help set the mood and show where I drew my inspiration from.</p>
<p>You may notice that both of these projects were in black and white (no colors or grays). This is a pretty ingenious call because by  limiting us in the color department we are forced to put more emphasis on line width, stylization, and shadows and highlights. If something works well in black and white there&#39;s no reason why it won&#39;t work well in color.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and Operating Systems (NOS)</strong>
As stated before the name of this class is a misnomer. They are actually in the process of converting it into Digital Storytelling, focusing more on getting a point across as opposed to the technical aspects of computers. I have to say of the two classes I am currently taking this is my favorite not necessarily because of what we do but because of our instructors, Fabian Socarras and Jacob Kaplan. It&#39;s difficult to explain how there two teach (if indeed they are really teaching at all), but it is certainly the most entertaining course and, so far, the most informative.</p>
<p>But, that aside, I&#39;ve been doing some pretty cool stuff here as well. After the trailer project we all made podcasts (I will not be posting mine, thank you very much). Our last project was to prepare a Keynote presentation trying to convince our target audience of why we needed something and, subsequently, why they should purchase it for us. I did mine on why I needed a Nintendo 64. I presented in front of my lab group and Fabian and Jacob invited themselves in as presenters which was cool. Will you ever see this keynote? Perhaps, perhaps not.</p>
<p>Our next project is something that, for me, is pretty easy stuff. We are to set up and design a blog using Wordpress. To make things challenging for myself I asked Fabian if I could write mine from the ground up as opposed to using Wordpress. While he gave the nod of approval, he seemed dubious as to whether or not I could pull it off within the time frame and meet all the criteria. Considering most of my back end is already in place, and with the addition of a couple of new modules I pounded out tonight, I foresee no problems. However, it turns out this will be a group project so I may just stick with Wordpress so as not to make myself appear elitist to my fellow classmates. No, that can wait until my official web classes a few months down the road.</p>
<p>That&#39;s about all for now seeing as I need to get to bed so I can be up at eight o&#39;clock tomorrow morning. Here&#39;s hoping I have afternoon classes AND labs next month.</p>

Hah! You thought it was going to be something about Smash Bros., didn&#39;t you? Well, my friend, you were WRONG!</p>
<p>This is actually a school project. If you can name for me a college (other than mine) that tells you to rip your DVDs and then cut them together in a bizarre manor, I will give you piece of candy. This movie here is the result of about seven hours straight of work. I was up until three in the morning finishing this thing up and, many, many revisions later, I get something that&#39;s almost semi-believable. I was trying to just use Episode III Anakin so that I&#39;d have some continuity. I also needed to cull footage from a red vs blue lightsaber battle which limited me to the Dooku fight and the fight at the end of Episode V. I was hoping for some more close-up shots, but there weren&#39;t very many in either of those battles. Lucky for me the sets were fairly similar so that helped a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Rap</strong>
I have come to the realization that rap music is an ongoing attempt to find the frequency of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note">brown note</a>. Let&#39;s look at the facts:
1) Rap has a lot of deep bass notes.
2) The people who have giant subwoofers in their cars listen to rap.
3) Rap can stand for Rectal, Anal, and Poop.
Coincidence? I think not.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Redesign: The Reason</h2><time>October 27, 2007</time><div><p>As I write this I am taking a hiatus from, once again, coming up with a new design for my blog. The major question I&#39;m sure that&#39;s on everybody&#39;s minds is &quot;Why do you redesign your blog so often?&quot; After pondering this question myself I have come to the conclusion that I just enjoy coming up with new designs. This in turn begs the question why go live with every new design? Why not just create the designs on the side and leave the live version alone? Because I end up liking what I&#39;ve just created more than what&#39;s currently implemented. </p>
<p>The relationship I have with any piece of art I create is generally a strained one. I&#39;m very self-critical of everything I create. It is very rare that I make something that I like for any extended period of time. I think the problem stems from the fact that every time I see one of my works I begin finding flaws. These flaws are not necessarily seen by others, but I can see them. This is generally fine for, say, a movie or a drawing. I don&#39;t have to look at them once they&#39;re done. My website, however, is something I see fairly often. I come to see if people have left comments, to post entries, etc. It is hard for me to turn a blind eye to any flaw I see in the design when I am faced with it over and over.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, I also just plain and simple like creating new designs and trying out new things. As I surf the internet I am constantly bombarded by all sorts of different color schemes, layouts, etc. and these intrigue me. I get all excited and before too long I&#39;ve got Photoshop and Notepad++ up and running and I&#39;m hacking away at the latest entry of my long list of designs. Excluding the Wordpress and Blogger themes, I have made live three designs for my blog since June of &#39;05. That&#39;s not including the designs I had from &#39;01 to &#39;03, anything I created for any of the various other sites I&#39;ve managed (YPN, my church&#39;s website, Digital Double), or the designs that never saw the light of day.</p>
<p>I realize that changing up the site design so frequently is not necessarily a good thing, especially in a commercial environment. It can confuse people and probably would piss some off to the point of not returning. Granted, there are sites that do this (digg comes to mind). However, since this is my personal blog, my sandbox as it were, I&#39;m not worried about too much. I generally try to keep the overall aspects more or less the same breaking everything down into navigation, body, extras. </p>
<p>Though it is beyond the scope of this article, one thing I have messed up through all the redesigns is my URL naming conventions. Usually when I roll out a new design I&#39;m also rolling outa new CMS (conent management system) to go with it and these don&#39;t always use the same naming conventions for internal links. This causes links in older posts, google&#39;s index, etc. to become broken and raises general chaos. I&#39;m happy with my naming conventions now and this will remain the same even when I do change the back end. Permalinks will be exactly that.</p>
<p>So, that is the &quot;logic&quot; behind my madness, tune in next week to watch the evolution of my designs and learn the rules behind them.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>First month of school completed!</h2><time>October 24, 2007</time><div><p>It&#39;s been nearly a month since I last posted anything of relevance. A lot had happened since then. I&#39;ve completed my first month of school and, as such, my first set of classes. Now I won&#39;t pretend to understand I know how a traditional college works but I do know that Full Sail&#39;s approach is much different (and, in my opinion, much more sensical). Every month we have two courses that we attend for four weeks. These are broken down into, generally, five eight-hour days per week with few breaks in between save major holidays. This is how we pull off a four year degree in only twenty-one months. These five day weeks are broken down into one subject being done three days and the other two. This month I was lucky enough to only have four days of school per week but all I did were gen ed classes, namely art history and english composition.</p>
<p><strong>Art History</strong>
Art history was interesting if nothing else. We got see all sorts of art from various periods of time starting with the cave men and their wall paintings. My favorite eras were definitely the Renaissance and Baroque. It is rare to find an artist that skilled these days. The Greeks were awesome as well with all their master marble working. The only problem with them, however, is their crazy preoccupation with penises. I could&#39;ve done without that, thank you very much. We also took a trip to the Orlando Museum of Art. Some pretty interesting stuff their from ancient artifacts up to Andy Warhols. But, the best part of the whole thing was when we had to make our own pieces of art emulating other styles and then have them displayed in front of the whole class. A lot of good laughs shared there. Here&#39;s my pieces:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/arthistory.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/arthistory.jpg">http://www.dxprog.com/pics/arthistory.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/arthistory.jpg</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url]
For this we were supposed to do a cave painting using a movie as the theme. Fifty points to the person who can correctly name the movie.</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/MHackmann.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/MHackmann.jpg">http://www.dxprog.com/pics/MHackmann.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/MHackmann.jpg</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url]
I was shooting for cubism but wound up pulling a weird combo of things, namely cubism, abstract, and pop art. I like it, though.</p>
<p><strong>English Comp</strong>
This is the course I&#39;ve been sweating through the most. Though I have a better than average grasp of English and grammar, primarily through keeping this blog and a lot of reading, I felt that my writing was too erratic and too concise to pull off this class successfully. Luckily we only had to write three papers (four if you include the ungraded one we wrote at the beginning of the course). They were each a different kind of paper, these being a memoir, a print ad analysis, and a research argument. We&#39;ve also had to do some group presentations in front of the class. The last of these almost got seriously screwed up because we misread our little topic card. About ten minutes before we did our presentation we realized this and were scrambling to come up with relevant information. We wound up just pulling the whole thing out of our asses at the last minute but still managed a one hundred. I&#39;m surprised points weren&#39;t taken off for my visible knee shaking.</p>
<p>On the whole I&#39;ve been having a good time considering that I&#39;m in school learning stuff. I&#39;ve made a bunch of friends and at that ones who are in the same boat I am, meaning they can quote the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqiSkd1M6k">300 PG trailer</a>. Next week I get to look forward to designing computer graphics and networks and operating systems as my courses. Should be awesome.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Apple keeps getting me...</h2><time>September 29, 2007</time><div><p>I do not consider myself an Apple zealot, but I&#39;ll have to admit that they make very nice hardware. I&#39;m completely loving my Mac Book Pro. It&#39;s doubley more awesome that my Mac mini in almost every respect. Clock speed, RAM, hard drive space, video, you name it this thing is better. And it&#39;s portable. And it gets blazing hot when it&#39;s doing heavy processing, hotter than the surface of the sun I&#39;d say.</p>
<p>Yesterday I picked up my books and softwares, those being Final Cut Studio 2 and Adobe Creative Suite 3 (adds up to a grand total of $3000+). I loaded up CS3 immediately and had fun doing stupid Photoshop jobs all day.</p>
<p>[gallery=Photoshop Fun]<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/matt_and_jessica.png" alt="" title="My roommate Matt and the very pretty Jessica Alba"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/matt_lost.png" alt="" title="Ms. Alba is fine, but Claire is finer...">[/gallery]</p>
<p>I tried screwing around with FCS2 last night but didn&#39;t really get anywhere. Final Cut Pro itself seems fairly straight forward so far but I couldn&#39;t figure out Color (color grading app) which is a bummer because one thing that my videos need are to be color graded.</p>
<p>School doesn&#39;t start until Tuesday and I&#39;m beginning to get a little bored. E and I have been playing Halo 2 and we watched all the Back to te Future movies, but I&#39;m ready for school. I do have my copy of Eternal Sonata now so maybe that&#39;ll ease the pai of waiting even if just by a little bit. I could always draw, I suppose. But I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to top this:</p>

</div></article><article><h2>News from Florida!</h2><time>September 25, 2007</time><div><p>Before I delve into the juicy, gory details I will warn anybody who&#39;s unfortunate enough to be on dial-up: there&#39;s going to be pictures. Lots of them. Be patient.</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;ll start with the beginning. I was born around 10ish on June 8th, 1986. Life was pretty good until they cut my umbilical cord. You see I... Okay, too far back.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Sept. 17th, was a crazy, hectic day because I really hadn&#39;t packed much up to that point. About the only things I <em>had</em> packed were my books and DVDs. That left this:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/1420193247/]![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1115/1420193247_fa89023cc4.jpg?v=0">http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/1420193247/]![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1115/1420193247_fa89023cc4.jpg?v=0</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url]
(be sure to follow the link. I&#39;ve got region thingies set up on the flickr page)</p>
<p>As you can see it was quite a hellish nightmare. But, I got everything packed and by that evening it looked more like this:
<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1171/1421086050_df18fa477f.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Evening came and morning followed the first day.</p>
<p>The next day, Tuesday, began the first leg of our near thirteen hundred mile trip. After I said goodbye to my family we started off. Then we promptly returned because I&#39;d forgotten some things (that&#39;s not to say I got everything I&#39;d forgotten, though). That day we drove about seven hundred some odd miles, well over half the trip, passing through five states (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama). We stayed in a little town past Birmingham called Oxford. Evening came and morning followed the second day.</p>
<p>There&#39;s really not a whole lot to say about the second day of driving. We passed through Atlanta (uneventfully I might add) and drove from there on down to Florida. One thing I will say about Atlanta, though, is that there&#39;s an assload of cars on the road. Twelve lanes and all of them packed. Once in Winter Park it took about an hour and a half to find our lodging for the night. Luckily we <em>did</em> find it and it was an easy drive to the apartments. We ate at Boston Market that night. It was pretty good (though the service was... weird). I&#39;ll forgo the Genesis reference this time.</p>
<p>So, it was finally the big day (or at least one of them). We made our way over to the apartments and got there without any trouble. However, we did circle the whole complex nearly three times before we found the leasing office which was tucked away discreetly behind some trees. It was there that I met up with my roommate and signed my life away to the dark cabal that controls everything. However, we did get a sweet apartment in return:

<p>As you can see in that last picture we have a sweet TV setup (or I do. It&#39;s all my stuff). The gibberish on the screen is our (at the time) messed up cable. Dragging everything up and in wasn&#39;t to big of a deal and really didn&#39;t take too long. Getting setup, that was another story all together. My room isn&#39;t completely unpacked yet though it&#39;s functioning at one hundred percent capacity.</p>
<p>That evening we went and bought some furniture.</p>
<p>[gallery=The Furniture]<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1179/1420255003_9dbece64bd.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="The most comfortable couch in the world!"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1314/1420255853_82ff3bf7e3.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="...and the lowly coffee table">[/gallery]</p>
<p>The next day we didn&#39;t do much aside from pull in some of the more minor items we needed. I spent a good chunk of the day working on the mess that was my room. I think I did anyways... By this time it was Saturday and I had to see my Dad off as he prepared to redrive the roads we had just been on. We (my roommate and I) didn&#39;t do much over the weekend. Bought some stuff, played some games, watched some TV, drew some pictures. Just kept low. Then came yesterday (Monday).</p>
<p>We were both getting kind of tired of not having much to do so we packed up and went to the beach. Daytona Beach, that is. Up to that point the closest I had ever been to the beach was watching LOST so it was something completely new for me. It was a hell of a lot of fun. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/1437562805_85b20260f6.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>We tossed a Nerf football around, we rode some waves, we walked up the beach (probably a mile or more not including the trip back). Being the off season there weren&#39;t too many people there and at that most of them were seniors. With the exception of the little kids we were the youngest people there. While it was fun and all there was a price to be paid. I had purchased some sunscreen before we&#39;d gotten there, but was unable to get my back. My roommate, who I will refer to as E, didn&#39;t put any on at all. So by the time we got home he was completely red and my back felt like it was on fire. That evening we laid low and watched all the new offerings on NBC and headlines on Jay.</p>
<p>Tonight we&#39;re going to be going to a little meeting thing at the school and tomorrow is registration and the getting of our Mac Book Pros. It&#39;ll be sweet to be sure. I&#39;ll be back a full update including pics. Until then, stay cool.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Musings of moving</h2><time>September 16, 2007</time><div><p>It is currently September 16th, 5:30AM CDT. Temperature is in the mid-sixties with some cloud cover. I&#39;m sitting here asking myself what the hell am I doing up at five in the morning? There&#39;s a myriad of ways I could answer that question but the one that seems to fit the bill the most is anxiety... and heartburn (one too many sausage calizones) . Today marks only two days left until I set out on my cross-country trip to begin my new life.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve only been waiting for this moment for twenty-one years but when the time is actually upon you it feels different. Everybody and everything I&#39;ve ever known will all be left behind; thirteen hundred miles behind. I&#39;ve known this for some time but it didn&#39;t really hit me until it was brought up that I&#39;ll never live in this house again. Never again will I call it my home. From here on out I&#39;ll be fending for myself. Alone.</p>
<p>Another thing on my mind is the actual trip itself. The longest car trip I&#39;ve ever taken is up to Morrison, Missouri a six hour trip that was generally broken down into two days on familiar roads. This trip to Florida, however, is more than three times the length over the same amount of time on roads completely unfamiliar. Luckily there&#39;s Google Maps to help with that, but twenty hours is still a long time to be cooped up in a car.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#39;m going finish packing all my stuff, taking apart all my furniture, and trying to mentally prepare myself for the day after when I have to say goodbye to my family. How do you say goodbye to those that you&#39;ve been around all your life? To the siblings that you grew up with and are your best pals? I&#39;m really bad at goodbyes and I can tell you now that Tuesday morning is going to suck.</p>

Even though I&#39;ll only be able to bowl twice I&#39;m still excited. I&#39;ve been bowling twice in the last couple of weeks and did really well, all games over average and two over two hundred. I could even have some beers if I wanted. T&#39;will be an awesome time to be sure.</p>
<p>Today <em>also</em> marks the two week mark until I leave for Florida. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m currently bored out of my skull. I got most of my packing done <em>last</em> week so that&#39;s done. I really don&#39;t have much to pack, really. What packing is left to do is of the stuff I use regularly... wait. I <em>have</em> said this before :-/. Granted, I haven&#39;t packed the kitchen stuffs yet so there is something left to do. I also need to get my haircut at some point.</p>
<p>That isn&#39;t to say I&#39;ve been completely idle. I did do that little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html">YPN</a> thingy. I&#39;ve been playing some games that I never finished <em>ahem</em> Thousand Year Door <em>ahem</em>. I <em>was</em> going to make another short movie, but lack of wardrobe kind of puts a damper on that. You&#39;d think it&#39;d be a simple matter finding a white wig, but no. Not in Bartlesville.</p>
<p>Whilst I was out on one of these wig finding missions I ran across something at a local craft store. It was a cheap glue gun (packaged and distributed in my good state of Oklahoma). It looks fairly standard to the casual observer but reading the fine print reveals, well see for yourself:</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Have you ever hated yourself?</h2><time>September 1, 2007</time><div><p>Sounds like the title of one of the many things I see copied and pasted onto a MySpace bulletin. Before anybody cries foul, I don&#39;t hate myself. I&#39;m a very content person and more or less happy with who I am. And beside, I&#39;m going to a kick ass school (one month from yesterday) so life is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>However, the last few days I took a trip to the past and came face to face with my younger, stupider, teenage self. What started out as a kind of fun little programming project quickly brought home that, yes, I was a complete douche bag. It was just a small project to keep me occupied (which it did), but...</p>
<p>I restored the old <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html">YPN message board</a>. It was kind of fun to read some of the old stuff from before I came on, but the minute I started getting to my posts the pain came on. It was obvious that I was... different. I was trying to fit in a crowd of very different people but I thought I was cool like them. If I saw something that pissed me off (and it didn&#39;t have to be much) I&#39;d make some idiot remark instead of just shutting up and moving on. When I came to power it was obvious it went straight to my head. Most of that is more apparent in the days after the old phpBB forum (which I have not gone through), but it all begins right there.</p>
<p>For your enjoyment I have provided a list of all the groan moments:

<p>Today I stepped on a nail. It felt good so I stepped on it again. God, my life sucks.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Crap aplenty!</h2><time>August 28, 2007</time><div><p>I&#39;ve said it before and I will say it again: Titles are not my strong point. Especially when I know I&#39;m just going to ramble about random stuff.</p>
<p>Today marks the three week mark until move out day. Excited? Yes. Packed? Partially. I started packing last week and have pretty much gotten to the point where&#39;s there&#39;s nothing left to pack save what I&#39;m currently using (Xbox, computer, TV, that stuff). I suppose I could pack up my pots and pans and malarky, but eh...</p>
<p>I did wind up trading Pokemon (and a myriad of other games) in and picked up a copy of Puzzle League. It&#39;s good, but it definitely is NOT Tetris Attack. Ranked matches... well there really aren&#39;t ranked matches. The closest thing is the &quot;Birthday Mode&quot; which ranks you against people with the same birthday. I&#39;m number one... and the only person on the list. Not many people play PPL online. Another thing that cheeses me off is the difficulty level; it&#39;s too easy. There&#39;s really slow, slow and about what would equate to normal in TA. Nothing in between. The music sucks too. It&#39;s just standard ambient/techno type music like you&#39;d find in Lumines or any recent (non-DS) Tetris game. The music from Tetris Attack was awesome. Every single piece. I&#39;ve got the Blargg music on my iPod for heaven&#39;s sake! That&#39;s how awesome it is. But otherwise, it is Tetris Attack and I can play online but they&#39;ve screwed up the best puzzle game of all time.</p>
<p>I took a little Lord of the Rings quiz thingy on Facebook (which is definitely better than MySpace) and I&#39;m a true LOTR fan. The questions were rediculously easy like &quot;What race is Legolas?&quot; Some information I suppose probably can&#39;t be gleaned from the movies. But at that even a casual reader of the books could get all the questions right. Either that or I&#39;m a bigger nerd that I thought. Meh.</p>
<p>Well, like a said, general ramblings of random stuff.</p>

<p>The start of a new arc. Pretty pleased with most of the artwork here, except Bowser in that last panel. Missed yesterday&#39;s update, but oh well. It&#39;ll be coming Monday. Technically all I need to do is arrange it as I&#39;ve got the artwork all drawn up. Now on to some artworks.</p>

<p>This was going to be the first panel <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/211204/bad-idea/">Monday&#39;s comic</a>, but when it came down laying everything out it just didn&#39;t fit. Probably the most risque thing I&#39;ve ever drawn, but don&#39;t blame me. Blame Nintendo. They love their Peach pr0n, I &#39;spose.</p>

<p>I wanted to try drawing some chibis and something Guitar Hero. This is what came out. I like the bassist and the singer best.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Safari how you piss me off!</h2><time>August 19, 2007</time><div><p>I&#39;ve been booting over to OS X lately seeing as I&#39;ll have to get used to it when I go to school. Safari, however, is pissing me off. The colors on here don&#39;t render properly. It&#39;s the same problem that plagued IE4-5. So the gradient at the top doesn&#39;t properly blend into the background. Instead it&#39;s a disgusting blocky chunk. At that the gradient isn&#39;t smooth like it&#39;s doing some sort of weird compression thing a la AOL. Apple, if you&#39;re software &quot;just works&quot; why does it have problems that were fixed over ten years ago? Bastards.</p>
<p>Anyways... I now have less than one month in my current place of residence. On September 18th I set sail (heh) for Florida and my future. It&#39;s about the only thing I think about and it&#39;s making time go incredibly slow. To say I&#39;m looking forward to the move would be like saying Jesus is a good man. But, I do not wish to dwell on the topic and more.</p>
<p>Yesterday I rented Mario Strikers Charged (Wii). It&#39;s okay. Online play is always a plus, but they really dropped the ball on the music. Every piece of music is a two to five second loop. It really, really, really blows chunks. But the game itself is pretty fun and it controls well. So if you just mute the TV and turn on some tunes its not so bad. Too bad the Wii doesn&#39;t support this instrisnicly like a certain other console...</p>

<p>I found a slight error in my previous statement about the Britons. Patrick Stewart. He&#39;s more awesome than most Americans.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I hate Brits!</h2><time>August 16, 2007</time><div><p>The title has absolutely no bearing on the subject matter of this post, but I thought I&#39;d throw it out there. Everytime they say &quot;biscuit&quot; instead of cookie I think to myself &quot;Stupid, buscuiting Brits!&quot;. But I digress.</p>
<p>Actually, one thing I hate more than Brits is fruit flies. And, apparently, they hate me too. They&#39;ve been trying to kill me lately. Over the last two weeks they&#39;ve sent suicide bombers down my windpipe and up my esophagus. It&#39;s really pissing me off. I&#39;ll be happily watching Next Gen or something, there&#39;ll be a faint &quot;bzzztt&quot; followed by the nast coughing fits. Burn in Hell, fruit flies, burn in hell.</p>
<p>Finished with my Pokemon game I decided to have some fun. That&#39;s right, I hacked my save file. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of selling the game off and picking up Puzzle League. As much as I still think it&#39;s a bastardization of Tetris Attack (which I&#39;ve been playing like crazy as of late) the thought of ranked online matches is a sweet morsel I may not be able to pass up. Maybe I&#39;ll just stick with Tetris DS for now. Maybe I should stop buying games.</p>
<p>At least until Eternal Sonata comes out ;-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Pokemon Diamond - A Review</h2><time>August 14, 2007</time><div><p>I hated Pokemon when it was cool to own five million pounds of various Pokemon related merch. I always thought it was dumb, Japanesey, and over-hyped. Things that over merchandise always piss me off. But that is not the point of this article. I&#39;m just giving my prior stance.</p>
<p>I picked up Diamond a few weeks ago because I needed something to play. Jeff has a copy of Pearl so I figured I could also play him when I move out to Florida. I will say that m experience was better than I expected it would be, but if you are a die hard RPG fan it will not satisfy your apetite.</p>
<p>Though it is classified as such, Pearl/Diamond is not much of an RPG. It shares many aspects that are common to the genre such as battles, leveling up, world exploration and such, but it lacks the one thing that makes Final Fantasy games the best RPGs ever: story. The game opens with you  and your buddy suddenly waking up and deciding to become Pokemon trainers. A certai Dr. Rowan gives you your Pokedex and you are given your primary mission of filling it with all sorts of info on exoctic Pokemans. As you traverse the globe of Sinnoh you stop by local gyms to obtain badges which allow you to progress through the game.</p>
<p>Being a grinding game you&#39;ll be seeing a lot of the battle screen. Entering battle combines the two most common elements of RPGs: random encounters and visible ones (a la Mario RPG). The random encounters only happen in caves, water, and the &quot;tall grass&quot;. Dotted along the rest of the map are various peoples who, without asking your permission before hand, decide to do battle when you enter their line of sight. These are all rather easy and trite and more of a nuasance than anything.</p>
<p>Almost all battles are one on one making leveling up more than one or two of your Pokemon difficult and lengthy at best. One thing that really pissed me off were the stupid messages. Every time anything happens there&#39;s a message announcing it. &quot;It&#39;s still raining&quot;, &quot;Biscuit used Metal Claw&quot;, &quot;Fire Anus&#39;s health was drained&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s not effective&quot;. This drags out an already slow paced game. One thing that I found amusing/annoying in particular were the &quot;effectiveness&quot; messages. It&#39;s tell you your attack wasn&#39;t effective and then your enemy would proceed to die.</p>
<p>One thing this game is definitely not selling itself on are visuals or audio. The map is a combination of 3D environment with 2D sprites. The battle effects are probably the best looking parts of this game but still don&#39;t compare the Final Fantasy VI (keep in mind that game is 13 years old and was made for the Super Nintendo). Music is meh. Hummable but not memorable. The sound effects suck ass. You can always tell when a Pokemon was from the original game because it&#39;s little battle cry would be a series of Gameboyesque beeps. It&#39;s really sad when the dev team is too lazy to rerecord the sounds for better hardware. It sounds really stupid and out of place.</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve been pretty harsh up to now. I wasn&#39;t throughly impressed but I was mildly entertained. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll continue to play now that I&#39;ve finished that game (there are more quests and, of course, grinding). About the only replay value this game offers is through net play. But you&#39;ll have to know some people with the game and do the appropriate friend code swapping. Overall I give the game a 5/10.</p>

A few embellishments later it&#39;s a pretty cool sketch. Many hours, a few hair and grass tutorials later and it&#39;s this:

<p>Stay tuned next week when Tom Nook is hanged for his unforgivable crimes.</p>

<p>Holy fish, Batman! Two comics within a week! As can be seen my inks have vastly improved over my last <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/196367/">endeavor</a>. I&#39;m really pleased with how this turned out. Even the musculature looks decent. The only thing lacking, and this goes for most all my comics, is the lack of background scenery in panels 1 and 4. But I&#39;m not complaining.</p>
<p>Oh, since you can probably get Crackdown cheap at used game stores, you should pick up a copy. It&#39;s an awesome game. I actually had more fun playing that than I did the Halo 3 beta (mainly because I suck at Halo).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Shoes for thought</h2><time>July 28, 2007</time><div><p>Payless, the Wal-Mart of shoes, is famous for its buy one get one half off scheme. Of course, that&#39;s a mouthful of words right there so their brilliant marketing team reduced it down to &quot;bogo&quot;. However, when spelled back out it&#39;s Buy One Get One which is clearly a lie. It should be &quot;bogoho&quot;, but then I guess it sounds like some black guy ordering his prositutes around. Yo! Bo go, ho!</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t made one of these in a while. I was digging through some of my old stuff the other day and found my little comic ideas notebook. I always did like this one and I&#39;m not sure why I never made it. This and <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54176/">Pikachunks</a> were actually written at the same time and were supposed to &quot;air&quot; back to back. But, anyhoo...</p>
<p>Since I can&#39;t use Photoshop anymore and since GIMP sucks I had to ink the comic by hand. BY HAND! Actually, it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Not to say that it is without problems but it works.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Sketcharoo!</h2><time>July 24, 2007</time><div><p>Remember that sketch a day routine I suggested last week. Well it&#39;s back, only not quite so themed. The reason I stopped in the first place is because thqat Midna picture really bummed me out. It sucked. Hard core.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve actually got two days worth of drawing goodness, so I&#39;ll give you the first one:</p>

Mario as seen in Mario Sunshine (an awesome game). I&#39;m really pleased with how that came out. Also, there&#39;s Toad. I wasn&#39;t really trying to get a good shape or anything, I just wanted something to test my new pens out on. Up at the top is a little tuft of hair. Just wanted to practice some hair shading.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Life as an Internet Microcelebrity</h2><time>July 20, 2007</time><div><p>If you frequent digg you no doubt saw <a href="http://www.careerdistinction.com/onlineid/step1.html">this</a> a while back. For those who don&#39;t enjoy clicking links to find out pertinent information, it&#39;s a page that calculates how &quot;famous&quot; you are on the internet. I&#39;ll say this isn&#39;t entirely foolproof. All calculations are done via google search results, but it gives you somewhat of an idea about your... uniqueness.</p>
<p>Anyways, for fun I fed the information for a search of &quot;dxprog&quot; in and it turns out I&#39;ve got 10/10 points for being a microcelebrity. Cool, I suppose. But like I said, it&#39;s more about uniqueness and the fact that I&#39;ve stuck with one online moniker through my entire time on the internet helps. It also helps that I am the only person going by dxprog. The little calculation wouldn&#39;t work nearly as well if there were others who went by that handle.</p>
<p>This may sound egeotistical, but every once and again I google myself just to see what&#39;s been indexed about me. I&#39;ve kept a fairly open internet life so it&#39;s not hard to turn up a bunch of relevent results. First thing that pops up is this site, followed by my Digg profile, Digital Double/my Smackjeeves profile and a couple of videos. Sadly, the first video is the one that I loathe with all the hatred I can muster. But, that aside, this is a pretty good synopsis of myself as it stands currently.</p>
<p>The origins of my online presence, however, are seemingly lost forever in the Sea of Digital Bits we call the internet. All that exists of my very first web page is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/protontorp2/">gone</a> and since YPN has been screwed, none of that exists either. Actually, that&#39;s not true. YPN&#39;s entire history is sitting on a CD-R on my desk. Every last iteration, from sasq2 to Tetra 2. I&#39;ve even got the unfinished beta of <a href="http://partyfish.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=screenshots">partyfish</a>. But, I digress.</p>
<p>There are a few old things that are harbored on the same disc as said YPN stuff that I&#39;ve lovingly added to the archives (see the 2003 stuff on the right there). Nothing terribly interesting or deep, but it gives some insight as to what I was doing at the time (not a whole hell of a lot). But, then again, I was only sixteen and not much was really expected of me.</p>
<p>Well, this has been yet another fun trip down memory lane. Not sure why I post these things, but in twenty years it&#39;ll be interesting to go back and read everything. I&#39;ll probably think about myself now what I think of my former self: what a douchebag.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Eternal Sonata - An Eternal Wait</h2><time>July 19, 2007</time><div><p>Must post. Must get awful picture off the front page!</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve mentioned before that I&#39;m eagerly awaiting Eternal Sonata, the RPG making its way towards Xbox 360 sometime in September. Actually, it was a (if not <em>the</em>) primary reason I bought the console in the first place. Halo is good and all, but my heart lies with RPGs and other story type games (i.e. Pheonix Wright).</p>
<p>So, anyways, I&#39;d heard from a fairly reliable source that the latest Xbox magazine had a demo disc with ES on it. Almost immediately I went out and purchased a copy (I wasn&#39;t the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/07/18">only one</a>). But, with these thing rarely is the pot of gold so easily obtained. Nay, the bastard disc wouldn&#39;t load. Well, it would but it would only give me small nuggets of which I hungered for only to choke mere mintes (or less) into said meal. I was pissed.</p>
<p>Lucky for me I went back an reread the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/07/18">news post</a> for the comic I referenced up above and it held a small morsel of hope. An obscure reference to something about <a href="http://forum.teamxbox.com/showthread.php?t=517777">boiling discs</a> to resurrect them from DVD hell. I didn&#39;t really expect much but I needed to play this demo (and I didn&#39;t really want to be gypped out of $8.99). So I nuked some water in the microwave and slipped the disc in. Much to my surprise all problems were erased and I was one with the game... until the demo ended.</p>
<p>As for the game itself it is pure joy encapsulated inside a stream of binary ones and zeros. The artwork is fantastic, the gameplay is solid. I&#39;m hoping that the same will be said for the story as there isn&#39;t much sampling of that but from what I&#39;ve seem I think all will be well. It&#39;ll definitely be worth my sixty clams and will get me through the couple of weeks between when I move in and school starts.</p>
<p>Well, I think that was sufficient enough to get the evil off the front page. At least the initial load, that is. I would be careful about how far and how fast you scroll down the page.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Zelda Art Week - Midna</h2><time>July 18, 2007</time><div><p>[url=<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Midna.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Midna.jpg">http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Midna.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/Midna.jpg</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url]
So I decided to do Midna today. There are parts of this picture I kind of like but overall I really hate it. First off she looks like a guy. Second her head is not wide enough and I scrwed up the shading on the face so it&#39;s hard to make out her eye. The body I&#39;m happier with than what it originally was, but it still seems... off. Ugh. Maybe whatever I draw tomorrow will be better.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s Zelda Fanart Week!</h2><time>July 17, 2007</time><div><p>I need to do more drawing to help beef up my skills. As such I have set up a little exercise for myself: select a theme each week and do a drawing every day. This week&#39;s theme, as the title suggests, is Zelda. Specifically, Twilight Princess. So I bring you my first &quot;masterpeice&quot;:</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not terribly thrilled with this. All I can say is I can&#39;t wait to get my Mac Book Pro from the school loaded with Photoshop so I can use tools I&#39;m already familiar with. My Prismas are nice, but they lack an undo function.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Teh Arts</h2><time>July 15, 2007</time><div><p>Last couple days I decided to actually DO something and crack out my Prismas and create beautiful masterpiec es that will be remembered long after I die. Or something.</p>

Some kid and a frog off the cover of a book my little brothers and sisters got from the library. I was originally just going to draw the kid (which I only drew because that&#39;s what was in front of my face), but the crowd that had gathered around me started chanting for the frog. So I drew the frog. Whatever.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for some more awesome stuff. Awesome stuff that isn&#39;t wierd kids and flying frogs.</p>

He played pretty much every song off of Straight Out of Lynwood plus most of the mainstays (Eat It, Fat, Smells Like Nirvana, etc.). For the encore he played the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjJYywFNbuw">cellphone song</a> to which everybody, myself included, started waving their cellphones. After that he wound up with an extended version of Albuquerque. It was simply awesome. I shunned my quiet exterior and clapped and whooed and sang with everybody else. But, you&#39;re probably saying &quot;Shuddup, give us teh pix!&quot; I&#39;ve only got a few because getting good pictures with the crazy lighting so I&#39;m only giving you the good ones. Sucks to be you.

</div></article><article><h2>Some Thoughts</h2><time>July 13, 2007</time><div><p>Remember when CSS was first introduced and fancy colored scroll bars were all the rage? Remember when every site on the internet had some sort of cross-page transition? Remember when all sites used Times New Roman for their font? Remember animated GIFs? I do. Good Lord, those days sucked!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Let the Good Times Roll</h2><time>July 8, 2007</time><div><p>Today is my second day of being unemployed. It&#39;s a somewhat bittersweet feeling. It&#39;s awesome not to have to have the nightmares of work hanging over my head, but on the flipside I won&#39;t be able to hang around with all the pals I made over the last year and a half. Not to mention the seemingly endless supply of money is non-existant now. Oh well.</p>
<p>What really sucks, though, is the fact that I&#39;ve been sick the last several days. Actually it&#39;s more allergies than anything else. I blame the rotting vegitation due to receeding <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/tags/flood/">flood waters</a>.</p>
<p>I recently finished Crackdown. It&#39;s an awesome game but the ending really, really sucks. It sucked so bad I haven&#39;t played it since. Originally I bought Crackdown for the Halo 3 beta (which I never really played much) but the main game is still pretty sweet. I probably will start working on Final Fantasy XII again or maybe Halo 2. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t even finished Halo 1. Oh, Xbox 360 extended warranty ftw! I&#39;m no longer paranoid about using it.</p>
<p>Well, I have an important nap I have to take, so later!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Welcome to the Week of Top 5</h2><time>July 1, 2007</time><div><p>I&#39;m going to do something interesting this week and post all sorts of nonsense top 5 lists. Why? Because I can. That, my friend, is the beauty of the internets.</p>
<p>Top 5 Games I Wasted Too Much Time Playing</p>
<p><strong>5. Guitar Hero (I and II)</strong>
I will go on the record and say this is probably the best game of this generation. If I were getting paid per hour to play this game the same amount I&#39;m getting paid to push carts I&#39;d be freakin&#39; rich. I figure I&#39;ve probably played Freebird alone somewhere around 50-100 times and it&#39;s a ten minute song. It never really gets old.</p>
<p><strong>4. Final Fantasy VI</strong>
Only the best RPG made for the SNES, nay, of all time. I&#39;ve fully completed this game three times, partially many more, and I plan on playing through it again before I head off to college. It&#39;s that good.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past</strong>
I remember the first time I finally made it through this game. I&#39;d been playing it for darn near a year. I probably explored every nook and cranny and thensome. I&#39;ve since made it through twice on GBA and clocked many more hours on PC via emulation. Defeinitely one of the best games ever.</p>
<p><strong>2. Super Mario Bros. 3</strong>
The very first game I ever played. I haven&#39;t played this one to completion as many times as other games (due mainly to the fact that there&#39;s no save in the original NES version) but I did play it almost every day for pretty much the entire life of my first NES (two or three years). I have it on for my NES now (and I crack it out once in a while) and have the GBA version. This game pretty much set and holds the standard for all patforming games. Nothing&#39;s come close since.</p>
<p><strong>1. Tetris Attack</strong>
Oh, my gosh. Where to begin. I&#39;ve clocked more hours on this game than probably all the others combined. I&#39;ve spent countless hours writing this game on five different occasions (and am currently doing so again). I haven&#39;t bought Plant Puzzle League for DS because I&#39;m a Tetris Attack purist. Give me Blargg or give me death! Actually, I probably should buy it just for the online play, but I&#39;d use standard controls. None of this touch screen crap.</p>
<p>I do need to mention that Rogue Squadron, Episode I Racer, Zelda OoT, and Mario 64 are close runner ups. So, there you have it. Day one completed. Stay tuned for more inaninty on here at dxprog.com.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Joy and Pain - Two Sides of the Same Coin</h2><time>June 30, 2007</time><div><p>I do not go to work today. This is something to be joyous about. However, it was not meant to be this way. Thanks to my wonderful shoes, which have been possesed by the very soul of Satan himself, my foot is in pain. It sucks. Actually, it&#39;s sad more than it sucks for today was supposed to be the last Saturday I ever work at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>This Friday, July 6th, marks my final day there. There is indeed light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. I&#39;ve already planned a few things I am going to do before school starts. Theyare as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend a &quot;Weird Al&quot; concert</li>
<li>Start up a new comic</li>
<li>Practice piano</li>
<li>Read some books</li>
<li>Other various sundries</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. This will be like the most awesome summer EVAR!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Spammers, I smite thee!</h2><time>June 23, 2007</time><div><p>Once again people have thought it fun to spam my blog. To this I say: Burn in hell, you dirty bastards! But, oh well. I&#39;ve added some interesting features to the comment system that should keep them at bay... unless they actually write a bot to target my site specifically. But, in the meantime, the comments are back up and running. No crazy password, approval e-mail, or word verification necessary. That&#39;s how proud I am of my coding. That and the fact that I can&#39;t seem to programtically send e-mails on my server. It sucks. Hardcore.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Complete Adulthood Attained</h2><time>June 8, 2007</time><div><p>I can no longer in anyway be considered a minor. Now that I&#39;m 21 there&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t do... except run for president... and pull social security... and get AARP. Okay, some milestones left. I plan on celebrating the situation by getting some Mike&#39;s Hard Lemonade tonight after work and doing some celebrating.</p>
<p>It&#39;s more than just my birthday, however. It&#39;s also the second anniversary of my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/my-real-blog/">blog</a>. Several months ago I did a little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/spector-of-the-past/">&quot;look back on stuff I did&quot;</a> type post. However, this highlighted primarily minor things (such as buying an iPod or bowling really well). It never delved much into the major things and when it did it was kind of half-hearted. Today I&#39;m going to reflect on the major milestones.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/update-from-progland/">Applied for Job</a> (October &#39;05) - This would have to be the biggest milestone for me. As much as I hate to admit it Wal-Mart has completely changed me as a person. I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m more mature now and am a more socially adept person.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/its-official-i-check-people-out-for-a-living/">Became Cashier</a> (January &#39;06) - Had I not ever gotten on a register I probably would be a nicer person now. I know most of my current attitude developed during my time on a register because customers treat their cashiers like crap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/new-webcomic-by-yours-truly/">Rediscivered Drawing (April &#39;06)</a> - In this list I&#39;ve given so far I&#39;m pretty sure this is one of the only positive ones. This may seem fairly minor but it does play a large role in my decision for what I want to ultimately want to do for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/well-the-video-says-all-basically/">Driver&#39;s License</a> (May &#39;06) - That was only about three years too late. Not necessarily a major thing but it did bring me up to two out of three of the biggies (job, license, GED).</p>
<p><a href="http://okwu.facebook.com/s.php?k=10080&amp;id=136300399">Kathleen</a> (March-July &#39;06) - I never said anything in my blog about this but I did kind of almost have a girlfriend. Her name was Kathleen and she was a cashier. It started she&#39;d always sit across from me in the break room and we&#39;d talk and laugh. This began sometime in March right before I went to grocery. I didn&#39;t realize it until it was too late. This actually played a significant part in my return to cashiering. When I came back in May I had to wait until her and her then boyfriend broke up before I made my move. I had resumed the conversing during break thing to ease into things again and one day I got the balls to ask her for her phone number and that was the beginning of probably one of the best times of last year. We&#39;d text message each other all the time and we&#39;d chat in the break room and I even bought her lunch once. However, I began to get a little obsessive (and posessive) and she ended it with a simple, yet cliched, <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/69152/">message</a>. The text in panel two is an exact quote of what she said. This sent me into another deep blue funk for quite a while. The only good thing that came out of that whole mess (aside from some much needed wisdom) was a new <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/pictures-yay/">cell phone</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/updates-and-whatnot/">CSM</a> (December &#39;06) - This was something that I had worked my ass off for. I was in my gotta move up the chain phase at this point. It started off a little rocky but I got the hang of all the little technicalities. It was the stress of being bombarded from all directions by everybody that got to me in the end. After I shed the red coat I got complaints from a lot of cashiers saying they wanted me back. It&#39;s nice feel loved.</p>
<p>The Future (January &#39;07-present) - As most of you know late in January I got my Mac mini but there&#39;s an interesting tale around that that bears more importance than just getting a really cool computer. I called in snowed in the day it came (partially true) because I had to be there when it came. As fortune would have it Full Sail called that day wondering what my plans were. The problem was I had no plans for anything at all. I knew I wanted to go to college in the fall but that was about it. I had talked to Full Sail sometime during the old house rennovation in &#39;05 but I hadn&#39;t taken them up on anything. But, anyways, they called and I said I&#39;d like to attend in the fall and I&#39;d like to tour the place sometime in the spring. This was the catalyst. Something clicked and soon after that I got into the GED classes (for me just a formality), took the GED and passed, and finally enrolled into Full Sail. This is where I stand today.</p>
<p>When you look at these events as a whole it&#39;s like a very intracite yet well laid out puzzle. I have been a little slow in getting to where I&#39;m headed but I&#39;ve had a lot of time to get my head on straight and learn essential skills I&#39;ll need later. When I get to college I&#39;ll be able to fully focus on school because I won&#39;t have these things in the way. I know what it is I want and nothing is going to stop me from obtaining that goal.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Archives 360</h2><time>June 6, 2007</time><div><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed the archives bar over there so I will swiftly move on to a cooler topic.</p>
<p>As the title suggests I own an Xbox 360. Now I can proudly call myself a Wii60 person. I&#39;ve been wanting one for a while mainyl for the Halo series but also it&#39;s extensive online cataloge of awesomeness. For instance I can download HD quality Headlines clips... FREE! It freakin&#39; owns. The only thing that&#39;s going to come back to haunt me some day is the small hard drive. I could&#39;ve bought an Elite but I got a Premium instead. I stupid. I own Crackdown and Halo 2. I was originally just going to rent Crackdown (for the H3 beta of course) but I tried the demo and was like &quot;Hey, this isn&#39;t a bad game&quot; so I bought it. Of course, I haven&#39;t necessarily been playing these games. No, I&#39;ve been playing Phoenic Wright 1. It still kicks ass. In fact I&#39;d go so far as to say that case number four was my favorite yet.</p>
<p>Well, I could go on about such things for a long time, but I think I shall get soome sleep.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>And a Host of Angels Sang in Joyous Chorus!</h2><time>June 4, 2007</time><div><p>Okay, so heaven isn&#39;t rejoicing the fact that I&#39;ve got the site running under good ol&#39; dxprog power but I hate thinking up titles. As you can see comments and categories are back. You can&#39;t necessarily comment yet, but things are in place for it. Also archives are gone at the moment but those should be up tonight sometime. It&#39;ll be the first thing I work on after I get back from work. Until then enjoy what is and forever will be... PurpleFusion!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>In and of Ranting</h2><time>June 1, 2007</time><div><p>Since there&#39;s not much to write about that&#39;s happening in my life at this current point in time I will instead rant on a cornucopia of things. Note - these rants are very, very biased.</p>
<p><strong>MySpace profiles</strong>. We&#39;ve given power to these people to change the design of their profiles. Bad idea. Why, you ask? Because it seems a good chunk of the MySpace population doesn&#39;t understand the basic fundamentals of good design. Readability is the first thing that comes to mind. Green text against some sort of fractal design background is enough to induce some sort of crack induced brain trip upon those who are to look upon it. I will say this: that horrible piece of shit you call a MySpace profile layout doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect upon you as a person. I say this because I&#39;ve got friends and family on MySpace. In closing, though, you can&#39;t expect the users of a place where they themselves have... questionable design practices to be better.</p>
<p><strong>Carts</strong>. Don&#39;t be a douche bag. Put the fracking carts in a damn cart corral. Never, EVER put your carts up on a curb or on the grass. I will kill you. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong>. Has this completely gone out the window? Seriously, since the advent of instant messaging and e-mail everybody&#39;s grammar and spelling are simply atrocious. Their, there, and they&#39;re are one of the worst offenders. Nobody knows how to properly spell angel (many times transposing the &quot;e&quot; and the &quot;l&quot;). Nobody cares. And to think is the next generation of human being that we will have to hand the keys of the world off to when my generation gets old. It sends shivers up my spine.</p>
<p>Well, I think that covers most bases. If I haven&#39;t offended you please feel free to e-mail me and I&#39;ll do my best to correct said situation next time I rant. Peace out!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I Present Purple Fusion!</h2><time>May 24, 2007</time><div><p>This is the name of the new site backend I&#39;ve been working on. Now, for anybody who&#39;s been paying attention I haven&#39;t written a web engine since Tetra 2. The last time I worked on it was sometime back in &#39;05 I believe. Back then I was extremely proud of my little creation but I look back on it and think to myself &quot;that is one bloated piece of crap&quot;. It really was. Over 2500 lines of code. In comparison my new engine is only one or two hundred lines of code and almost as powerful (or it will be).</p>
<p>From a design standpoint Purple Fusion is way different from Tetra. Tetra was built around an object-oriented core. From an interface standpoint this was very clean. However, it did lend to some slowdown and made adding new modules cumbersome at best. It also limited what you could do with a module (to a degree). The new engine completely throws objects out the window (almost, the main class is PurpleFusion and that&#39;s the only one) and goes for a scriptable approach. Each page is it&#39;s own seperate page script that makes calls for getting data, displaying templates, etc. This makes creating new pages incredible quick and eliminates redundant code. Here&#39;s the script for the front page:</p>
<p><code>
&lt;page title=&quot;Home&quot;&gt;
    &lt;template:page_head&gt;
    &lt;db:entries limit=&quot;15&quot; sort=&quot;entry_date&quot; order=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;
    &lt;loop:entries&gt;
        &lt;dblink:category_name table=&quot;categories&quot; link=&quot;category_id&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field:entry_date type=&quot;date&quot; format=&quot;m-d-Y&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field:entry_body type=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;
        &lt;process:data&gt;
        &lt;template:entry&gt;
    &lt;end:loop&gt;
    &lt;template:page_foot&gt;
&lt;end:page&gt;
</code></p>
<p>As you can see it borrows from SGML&#39;s tag structure. Because of the tag structure it&#39;s very human readable and makes for quick prototyping. I&#39;m incredibly pleased with the way it&#39;s going right now and hopefully I&#39;ll have it running this site in a couple of weeks. Now that I think about it I could even speed things up by generating a cached version of the source code and just include that instead of parsing the page all the time. Yeah, this rocks.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Nothing&#x27;s Quite as Refreshing as a Swift Kick to the Balls</h2><time>May 22, 2007</time><div><p>That&#39;s a hell of a title right there. I haven&#39;t really put it out anywhere, but I&#39;ve had a <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> account for some time now. Like, almost a year. I put up some of my Matt (Digital Double) redesigns and promptly forgot about it. Well, since I&#39;ve been drawing all this stuff lately I&#39;ve been posting again and garnering some attention. Attention like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Dude, you don&#39;t have enough pageviews for the time you&#39;ve been to DA and the quality of your stuff. I&#39;ve only been here for a few weeks and I have more than triple your pageviews, it&#39;s annoying. Do more art! I less than three your style. = P&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s like a kick to the balls and at the same time it&#39;s nice. He obviously thinks highly of my artwork, but the whole &quot;d00d! I&#39;m teh n00b and teh p0puler and you teh arnt&quot; hurts slightly. He (I assume it&#39;s a guy) does have a point that I need to more art. One thing that baffles me, though, is that last sentence. The world may never know...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Art du Kick Ass</h2><time>May 21, 2007</time><div><p>I decided to switch gears and move away from the Final Fantasy XII fan art. This time I&#39;m doin&#39; Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the <strong>best</strong> artwork I&#39;ve ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are <strong>FIVE</strong> fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn&#39;t entirely faithful to the <a href="http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg">source material</a>, but I&#39;m really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin&#39; awesome.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>There&#x27;s something wrong with me</h2><time>May 20, 2007</time><div><p>Because I completed yet <em>another</em> work of art!</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m pretty pleased with it. It&#39;s a far sight better than the original pencil art I had. However, the top part of the body seems to be a bit too small compared to everythiong else. But, considering I don&#39;t draw girls very often I&#39;ll give myself a break. I suppose it&#39;s one of those things I&#39;ll need to work on eventually.</p>
<p>This whole mess of pictures actually comes from one piece of art I&#39;d drawn a while back for a comic (the point of which now escapes me). I&#39;ve enjoyed being able to make purty art again and I may keep it up just to keep me busy until September.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#39;ve begun searching for a roommate. I&#39;ve e-mailed a couple guys now and I hope to hear back from some one. Also, I&#39;m pretty darn sure that I&#39;ll be adding animation as a second degree. Drawing these pictres has really hit home that, hey, I&#39;m not <em>that</em> bad of an artist and, most importantly, I had a hell of a time doing it. So I&#39;ll need to e-mail them and see how much it&#39;ll cost me to tack that on. That&#39;d also mean spending twice as long at school, but it&#39;s so freakin&#39; cool that&#39;s hardly a problem ;-).</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Stuff and Nonsense</h2><time>May 17, 2007</time><div><p>The list of things I have to do to prepare for college is getting shorter. Currently I&#39;m working on picking out a roommate and after that we&#39;ll work on finding an apartment. Then I&#39;ll need to secure funds and come September 20th[ish] I&#39;ll be moving my stuff out there. So nothing new on that front, I&#39;ll move on to other things. Actually, I lied. I got a call from them the other day making sure I wanted to take the Digital Arts and Design degree because they think I&#39;d be happier in Animation (I promptly said I&#39;d be happy <em>anywhere</em> in that school). But I had actually been thinking of double majoring in either DAD and film or animation and the more I think about it animation and art as a whole has always been a big love of mine so I&#39;m giving that some serious thought.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently getting ready to do another film project this time spoofing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents">Elite Beat Agents</a>. I&#39;d give off more but I don&#39;t want to ruin anything. I&#39;ll be trying out greenscreen stuff for this. It seems <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> now has the ability to do professional green screen removal (with a little finagling) so I&#39;m going to try that out. In particular I&#39;ll be filiming seperate elements against the screen and combining them into one shot. But I have yet to actually build the thing, something I was going to do on days off (Tuesday and Wednesday) but I felt too lazy to drive out to Lowes to buy the stuff. I suppose I&#39;ll do it next week and in the meantime I can flesh out a script. This is something I don&#39;t do often because I have the vision in my head pretty clearly and I don&#39;t want to go through the trouble of writing or storyboarding it out. I&#39;m lazy that way and it&#39;s something I&#39;ll have to get over before I go to Full Sail.</p>
<p>I completed two games this week (the world must be ending). The first one was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Paper_Mario">Super Paper Mario</a> (Wii). It was, as I thought it would be, a comepletely enjoyable experience. The dialoge was top notch, as always, packed with plenty of laughs. The flip mechanism never got old and was always used cleverly. The story line was fairly predictable (I had the ending figured out about half way through). However, next to Zelda it&#39;s the best single player game out there for the Wii so if you own on I&#39;d suggest picking this up.</p>
<p>The second game I completed was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Justice_for_All">Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All</a> (DS) which, I admit, I probably enjoyed <em>more</em> than SPM. It&#39;s definitely not a game you buy for the graphics or sound because they&#39;re meh at best (the art&#39;s not bad, I will admit). What is crucial to this game is story and it delivers 110%. The first case, being the introductory one, wasn&#39;t the greatest but it gets you into the swing of things well enough. The second case was awesome, and probably one of my favorites. The third case had me stumped (to the point of <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">cheating</a>; I&#39;m ashamed). The last case was simply amazing. Just when you think you had it figured out everything was turned on end. They also introduced some things that made things harder and raised moral questions. To say that this game on a whole was absolutely phenomenal is an understatement. If you like story type games (RPGs, text-adventures) you absolutely have to buy this game. If you&#39;re more an action type gamer you probably wouldn&#39;t enjoy it much, but rent it at least. It&#39;ll do you some good. On that note I&#39;ll be buying the first game and third when it comes out.</p>
<p>Now that all that&#39;s out, I&#39;ll leave you with this piece of art I finished this afternoon. Cheerio!</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Guitar Hero for the NES</h2><time>May 9, 2007</time><div><p>This is the subject of my new faux commercial. Joe and Steve are the stars this time and it thrilled them to death. However, I can see where directing little kids in movies can be a pain in the ass. If you notice they&#39;re constantly looking at the camera. Ugh. I tried to caputre the feel of a standard commercial you&#39;d see on Nickelodeon, but the flow feels a little off. However, on the whole, I&#39;m definitely pleased with the effects shots (I did all of them, including the last one). One thing that&#39;ll be good about Full Sail will be all the professional tools at my disposal. But, enough banter, here&#39;s the video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxG2pjo_3HU"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/bxG2pjo_3HU/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>Saturday News Update</h2><time>May 6, 2007</time><div><p>Firstly, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/">pictures</a>. More importantly, however, I need to quit with this &quot;firstly&quot;, &quot;nextly&quot;, &quot;that other thingly&quot;.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock today was my big tour of Full Sail. Up till now I&#39;ve been referring to it as &quot;Full Sail, college of awesomeness&quot; however I think I&#39;ll have to start referring to it as &quot;Full Sail, college of kick ass!&quot;. It is seriously that freakin&#39; cool. When every classroom has computers in it (with the exception of one) you know it has to be cool. I&#39;ll try to describe the experience as best I can, but I won&#39;t be able to do justice to it. Please note that the accuracy of the order of events may be questionable.</p>
<p>It all started in a sound stage where the whole opening presentation was treated like a live talk show. The camera came over our heads for a nice sweeping crane shot and came to rest on the guy giving the opening monologue. There was another group in the adjacent sound stage who were watching in on what went on in ours. Once the opening ceremonies were finished they broke the group into the seperate degree sections (Digital Arts and Design for me) and began the &quot;global tour&quot;, i.e. seeing all of the facilities.</p>
<p>We were first led into one of the lecture rooms and were given a rundown of the &quot;LaunchBox&quot; initiative. What that is is the Full Sail and Apple have teamed together to give every student a Mac Book Pro loaded with fancy software such as <a href="https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/DesignPremium&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;promoid=RWTS&amp;nr=0#loc=en_us&amp;rangeUpper=6%2C0%2C65%2C0&amp;HTMLVerRedirect=true&amp;returnURL=%2Fcfusion%2Fstore%2Fhtml%2Findex%2Ecfm%3Fstore%3DOLS%2DUS%26promoid%3DRWTS%26event%3DdisplayProduct%26categoryPath%3D%2FApplications%2FDesignPremium%26distributionMethod%3DFULL&amp;store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/DesignPremium&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;promoid=RWTS&amp;nr=0&amp;viewName=Adobe%20Store%20%2D%20North%20America&amp;pageNotFound=0">Adobe Creative Suite</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/">Final Cut Pro</a>, and <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=5659302&amp;siteID=123112">3DS Max</a> to name the ones I remember. After they rambled on about that and the masters degree program we actually started looking at the cool stuff.</p>
<p>The first place we visited was the new dubbing studio. If you&#39;ve ever watched making-of documenteries you&#39;ve seen the giant sound board and the little couch behind it for the big wigs. Well, it&#39;s all there. We were seated and shown a clip from Return of the King. Apparently the guy who did sound design for the collapse of Barad-dur was a Full Sail graduate.</p>
<p>After that we went into one of the recording booths were some dudes were giving off a live performance. We didn&#39;t stay there very long, but I will say this: it was very, very loud. Also, we passed the server room on our way out of there. Very, very cool. </p>
<p>Next we were led into the motion capture studio. Sadly, the software wasn&#39;t working quite right and the 3d model&#39;s right ankle was twisted in all sorts of crazy manners. Still, how many other colleges have a motion capture studio, I mean, c&#39;mon. Killer!</p>
<p>I&#39;m not completely sure, but I believe after that we went onto another sound stage which was dressed up as an inner city street with a theater at the end. Apparently this is used to teach lighting techniques. This I look forward to because all the video projects I&#39;ve ever done have terrible lighting and it drives me mad. When you&#39;re going for a specific look and it you don&#39;t have the tools or knowledge to make it happen it gets a little disheartening.</p>
<p>At this point we began the degree specific tour. It started out in the room without computers that I mentioned earlier. It had a bunch of art desks. If I had to guess this is where I&#39;ll be taking my art history course. </p>
<p>After that we went into a classroom filled with twenty-four mac pros. Here we were lectured on the art of 2D print and how it relates to the design process such as company logos and product design. Apparently Illustrator is going to be an integreal part of this class. </p>
<p>Once done there we headed off to hear about motion graphics. This is the part that I&#39;m most excited about. They showed a demo reel from an old student there who went on to do commercials for the likes of MTV, Nickelodeon and the like. It was impressive and I&#39;m definitely looking forward to this. Oh, this room was filled with a bunch of Windows computers.</p>
<p>We were then led out by the coolest guy there (very happy and up-beat) and into yet another room with a bunch of Macs. He filled us in on the wonders of the web not only about the designs but the backend (which will be focusing around PHP). Luckily I&#39;ve got a good deal of experience in both those fields so that should be an easy class. Before heading on to the next stop we passed through one of the labs where final projects are done. Apparently we&#39;ll have more or less free license to do what we want there.</p>
<p>Our last stop in campus was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/487495670/">green screen room</a>. They&#39;ve got equipment that replaces green screen in real-time. The guy who did the lecturing here was practically giving lessons on how to use the software.</p>
<p>We then proceeded across the street to what I am currently calling the auditorium. Essentially it&#39;s a concert stage with the lights and the smoke and whatnot. This place is where any bands come to play and put on a show. Here we were luctured on career development and given a speech by the president of the college. If I wanted to I could&#39;ve gone on a behind the scenes tour of all the light control equipment and stuff, but I was hungry so that was the end of the tour for us.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, words really can&#39;t describe how cool this place is. You have to see it (in person) to get how freakin&#39; awesome it really is. The only caveat I see to this all is that I still have to wait five months until I start. It&#39;s going to feel very unsatisfying to go back to cart pushing after this.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say about Orlando (possibly Florida as a whole). The whole place smells like it&#39;s been perfumed. It&#39;s a scent I noticed stepping off the plane. I first thought it was indigineous to the airport but it&#39;s like everywhere. Almost like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefly_planets_and_moons#Miranda">another place</a> we&#39;ve heard about....</p>
<p>Well, that was really, really long so I&#39;ll wrap it up. At noon tomorrow (Eastern time) we depart for Memphis again. Until then, peace out.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Aloha from Orlando!</h2><time>May 5, 2007</time><div><p>Well, I am now in the sunshine state&#39;s most famous city: Orlando. I&#39;m about 10-15 minutes from Universal, and hopefully, not too far from the school. I was going to do a blog update in Memphis but their WiFi was broken. Kind of funny because they were advertising it to the nines.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now flown on two planes and I can say I&#39;d rather be in the cockpit. I have a phopia of needing to see where I&#39;m going and it drives me nuts to just be able to see out the side. Also, night flying in storms is... interesting. Coming in over Orlando was quite impressive. In fact it looked a little like <a href="http://coruscant.info/Globecoruscant.jpg">this</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m dead tired. As always check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog">Flickr</a> page.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Howdy from Tulsa International!</h2><time>May 5, 2007</time><div><p>TUL, if you need the three letter abbreviation for future reference. We&#39;ve just sat down and I&#39;ve paid my $5.96 for wireless internet (sucks). Our flight is scheduled to leave at 4:28 PM CDT and it is currently 2:23 PM CDT so we&#39;ve got a little bit of a wait. This flight will be taking us to Memphis, TN and then we&#39;ll have <em>another</em> two hour layover at which point I will probably be playing <strong>Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice For All</strong>. I&#39;ve already played through the first scenerio and it&#39;s freakin&#39; awesome. Kind of reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown">Encyclopedia Brown</a> (and how much I sucked at them). Seriously, though, it&#39;s a great game. I&#39;ll probably buy the first when I&#39;m done with this one.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#39;t have a plug-in here so battery life is at a premium. I may do a quick update when we get to Memphis, but I&#39;ll definitely do an update once in Orlando. Be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/sets/72157600180317876/">Flickr</a> album for pictorial updates. And, just a note, wireless internet FTW.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Silence be lifted!</h2><time>May 3, 2007</time><div><p>I&#39;ve been holding out on this news for quite some time now, but since everything seems to be falling into place like a well played game of Tetris I will let all the cats and their friends out of the preverbial bag.</p>
<p>First, and most importantly, I have finally gotten my GED. I will brag a little and post my scores:</p>
<p>Reading -  96%
Writing - 82%
Math - 99%
Science - 95%
Social Studies - 99%</p>
<p>Now those little percentages are how many people taking the GED in US are stupider than me, to put it not so nicely. Rather surprising, really, because I found the test to be incredibly simple. IMO, my essay did suck pretty bad. I was supposed to write about how I expected to be remembered which was kind of a lame topic to begin with. I am, usually, a fairly concise writer so coming up with 25 sentences on this topics was really, really hard. In the end I kind of wandered off topic talking about something else completely, but I had about 5 minutes to come up with an extra paragraph so I expanded on something I&#39;d touched on earlier. It sucked, trust me.</p>
<p>Since I have now hurdled hugh school the next logical step is college. Funny thing is that was lined up before my GED was. I have been accepted at Full Sail&#39;s school of awesomeness and will be taking the Digital Arts and Design degree. This means I will have to relocate myself to sunny Florida. Do I mind? Hell, no. Do my parents mind? I don&#39;t think so. Does everybody else mind even though it really isn&#39;t their business? Yes. I&#39;ve gotten more &quot;why would you move to Florida&quot; comments than I care to count. But, that aside, I&#39;m going to be attending the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; tour this weekend so I&#39;ll have plenty to blog about whilst I&#39;m there or when I get back. And don&#39;t worry, there&#39;ll be pictures and maybe some video.</p>
<p>Speaking of video, I&#39;m going to be making another faux commercial. I&#39;ve got the script ready, all I need to do is film, write some music, make some visuals, cut it all together in iMovie <strong>HD</strong> and put it up on YouTube.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, Chris got his electric guitar Monday and has been teaching himself to play (as have the rest of us). I will say this much: playing guitar is a bitch. I thought the piano was bad. At least it&#39;s pasture is much more spacous. Chris seems to be concentrating mostly on memorizing chords while I went and taught myself how to read tablatures and am trying to play stuff that&#39;s way out of my league (in my defense, however, I can play the first three notes of &quot;Sweet Child O Mine&quot;).</p>
<p>And, speaking of iMovie, I kind of moved away from OS X. I&#39;d been using it exclusively for quite some time and then Photoshop died. So I decided I&#39;d redownload it for Windows (I&#39;m a bastard that way) and I haven&#39;t really booted out of it since except to copy some files. I&#39;ve finally gotten more or less used to Vista. The interface, IMO, is more complicated now than it had been (especially the network dialogs). So I am, once again, a Windows man.</p>
<p>Well, I believe that shall tide the masses over at least until the weekend. Keep coming back as I will be blogging down in Florida (assuming our hotel has complimentary G, but it looks grim at this point). We shall see... we shall see...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>And the Lord said</h2><time>May 2, 2007</time><div><p>&quot;Let this, the tenth or so redesign of Matt&#39;s website, be!&quot;. And he saw that it was good and clean and very Web 2.0 and he rested....</p>
<p>It&#39;s not using my new backend yet, but I figure this is pretty good anyways. I just need to get my htaccess file reinstated so the archives work.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Numbrs!</h2><time>May 2, 2007</time><div><p>Just remember, children, today&#39;s episode of Digg is brought to you by the numbers 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is absolutely insane. I missed everything until now because our router decided to die leaving me without internets. So, I&#39;ve got things kind of working now, I go to check digg and there&#39;s about two pages of front page stories containing, in some way shape or form, the following hexadecimal number: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. I guess Digg got a cease and desist from the good old MP of double A and they started pulling any stories with the following string of numbers and letters: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. Well, people got ticked off because 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 is their favorite copy/paste fodder so they inundated the place with 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 this and 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 that and that&#39;s where it stands now. Apperantly K. Rose and Co. are allowing 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 to be shown all over the place and say that if it kills Digg that&#39;s fine since they went down with a mutha-09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 fight. Personally, if Digg goes down due to this I may start pirating ALL my movies just to let them know how pissed off I am.</p>
<p>Thanks, have a nice 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 day.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&#39;s think for a second. Why would you have a single encryption key for EVERYTHING!? You people are stupid bastards. G&#39;Day. 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Flori-duh!</h2><time>April 28, 2007</time><div><p>No offense to the state, just a little thing Dave Berry is always pointing out (you can&#39;t spell Florida without the &quot;duh&quot;). If I haven&#39;t mentioned the fact that Dave Berry is one of the funniest columnists alive, I will do so now and tell you to go out and get some of his books. The Guide to Guys and Money Secrets are my personal favorites. But, this all really has nothing to do with this blog post so I will move along.</p>
<p>I guess the first thing I want to say is that Guitar Hero II is pretty much the best guitar-based game ever created. I kind of sat on the edge about it for a while because the song list seemed kind of meh compared to it&#39;s predecessor, but I decided to give it a chance and GameFly&#39;d it. I was unimpressed for a while and then I hit the boss song. Freebird. All 9 and a half glorious minutes of it. Needless to say I went out and just bought the game the next day and now I rock out on it all the time. Maybe I&#39;ll post a video sometime. Oh, and a sidenote, this whole Guitar Hero madness made Chris buy an electric guitar so maybe one of us&#39;ll be the next Van Halen or we can form a band and resurrect the glory days of the 80s. Maybe...</p>
<p>I&#39;m back to my old self again and have created a new design for the site. With everybody going &quot;Web 2.0&quot; I figured I&#39;d better jump on the bandwagon and stay current. However, in my defense, the original Tetra design used rounded tables before rounded tables were the thing to do, so I&#39;m a trailblazer there. I&#39;m going to wait to implement the new design until I&#39;ve gotten a new backend written. Wordpress is nice and all, but all the spam (which you lucky souls never see) is really driving me insane. Besides, I can make a less bloated piece of software to suit my needs. When it comes to web stuff I usually trust my own work over that of others. Maybe I&#39;m an egotistical jerk that way :-P.</p>
<p>Shifting to my public life, things at work ar fairly normal. However, I did drop the CSM charade and joined Robin Hood&#39;s Merry Men, or as everybody else knows us, cart pushers. You&#39;re probably thinking &quot;Wow! Why did you take that kind of a pay cut just to push carts, a lowly job made for the slime of the Earth?&quot;. Firstly, I wasn&#39;t actually being paid CSM wages, so I lost a whole .40 an hour. Secondly, that .40 an hour has bought me some sanity and hapiness. The lot is a nice, quiet place to be. The carts don&#39;t complain about their credit card being denied, or that something rang up the wrong price, or.... you get the picture. I don&#39;t know about people in other towns, but Bartians seem to be a whiny bunch (I&#39;ll admit I can be whiny as well).</p>
<p>Well, that about wraps it up for this blog post. Tune in next Friday as maybe I&#39;ll make this a weekly thing. It would do me some good to get into some sort of schedule of doing things.</p>

<a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/138907/">Clueless is as Clueless Does</a></p>
<p>This is probably the longest running story arc I&#39;ve had yet. Hooray for character development.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Digital Double Reviewed!</h2><time>April 1, 2007</time><div><p>Well, it seems the fine folks over at SmackJeeves have decided to review my comic. In a nutshell, they lauded the artwork and design (which I thought sucked) and criticised the writing (which I also thought sucked). Here&#39;s the full review: <a href="http://smacktalk.smackjeeves.com/04-digitaldouble">http://smacktalk.smackjeeves.com/04-digitaldouble</a>. Now for my take on things.</p>
<p>One criticism they mention is <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/73400/">A Comic for All Peoples</a> where my counterpart says that the comic is &quot;too deep for a person of average intelligence.&quot; This was actually something devusb mentioned when talking about the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/72976/">2001-WTF?!</a>. Of course, this leads to their other big complaint which is <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/92848/">too</a> many in-jokes. This is one of the reasons I switched formats, the other being I find it easier to write more story-like stuff as opposed to the gag-a-day I had been shooting for. Maybe I should employ the use of a writer.</p>
<p>As said above, I am the first to admit that my writing usually sucks pretty bad. For starters, any comic bearing the name F5 is going to suck. <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54191/">These</a> <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/63958/">comics</a> <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/88991/">suck</a>. Most everything else is pretty &quot;meh&quot; with the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/116184/">exception</a> of a <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/63395/">few</a>.</p>
<p>Their final comment in the cons section about &quot;being doomed to obscurity&quot; I&#39;ve pretty much comed to terms with. There are many people doing this that are a thousand times better at it than I. I&#39;ve just been using it as a creative and emotional outlet and that&#39;s probably all it will continue to be. If fame comes with it, cool, but I&#39;m not getting my hopes up.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Digital Double</h2><time>March 26, 2007</time><div><p>I haven&#39;t been posting the links for the recent comics lately. Shame on myself and shame on you for not subscribing to the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/rss/">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>Starting today I&#39;m off hiatus. There&#39;ll be a few changes however. Firstly, Jimmy&#39;s that guy in the middle. His hair is much easier to draw now. Secondly, that would be Mary on the right. These two things were the main reason I went on hiatus. Thirdly, there&#39;ll be a format change. I&#39;m going to do more story arcs instead of weak jokes and sad parodies. Finally, I&#39;ll be going with a every Wednesday update. Now that I&#39;m full time at Wal-Mart it&#39;s difficult to update twice a week. I figure I should also be able to keep this up once I&#39;m in college in the fall.</p>

<p>I had to come off hiatus to bring you that comic. My Photoshop trial is up so I&#39;m having to resort to more archaic methods of drawing at the moment. Btw, the new Spider-man 3 sneak peak has restored some faith in me that it won&#39;t suck.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>More Crap</h2><time>March 7, 2007</time><div><p>Wow! Two posts in one day?! I must be on crack! Tonight I give you another sad venture into art on my behalf.

</div></article><article><h2>A Word on the State of Apple</h2><time>March 2, 2007</time><div><p>As you may or may not know I am currently the owner of a new Mac Mini (Core Duo FTW!). Despite the fact that Windows is easily installed thanks to the magic of Boot Camp, I&#39;ve been working in OS X mostly. I feel I&#39;ve been using it long enough to give my opinion:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use. Once I figured out the basics I pretty much got it.</li>
<li>Stability (for the most part). A few minutes ago Safari died an ugly death on me dragging the rest of the system down with it and I&#39;ve been in a must reboot situation twice (not including the system updates)</li>
<li>Pretty looking. Hey, what can I say? I&#39;m a sucker for the genie effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple&#39;s interface guidlines tend to make apps overly simplistic. Toolbars are almost non-existant, everything seems to revolve around a drag and drop interface. This is an area where Windows apps can really shine given a developer who knows what they are doing.</li>
<li>Keyboard craziness. I don&#39;t know about you, but I use the Home and End keys to navigate through text boxes all the time. Albiet, it&#39;s still there (Cmd-Left and Right respectively), but pressing two keys (or three if I want to make a selection) is a lot harder. Also, they seemed to ignore the delete key as well. I&#39;m not a mouse person and I don&#39;t want to drag my effin&#39; files to the trash. I want to press delete (and Enter to close the resulting dialog box).</li>
<li>Unix directory structure. Windows can be incredibly clean in directory structure if done right. Unix is much, much more difficult and half the folders you can&#39;t see anyways. Also, mountpoints drive me nuts (although, OS X seems to keep track of all that fairly well).</li>
<li>Finally, hardware support. They tell you &quot;it just works&quot; but that&#39;s a lie. There are no drivers for my scanner (forcing me to use a piece of shareware), minimal support for my printer, NO support for my flash drive just to name a few. Driver support is something people complain about in Windows, but I have never, EVER had a problem with hardware in XP.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now that I&#39;m through with that I&#39;ll deliver my verdict: Windows XP SP2 is the best OS ever (and I&#39;ve used Vista so I can rule that one out). That said, OS X is definitely the best flavor of Unix I&#39;ve ever seen and I can get along with it nicely.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Digital Double Updates</h2><time>February 20, 2007</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/116184/">Link in Love</a></p>
<p>In my opinion, the best artwork I&#39;ve done to date. Not necessarily the best joke ever, but it was good enough to hit the Joystiq poll so I call it even.</p>
<p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/118330/">Pedophilia</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry. I did a Michael Jackson joke. Please forgive me.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Digital Double - &quot;An Important PSA&quot;</h2><time>February 13, 2007</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/114789/">Comic</a></p>
<p>A little late, but it&#39;s better than most of my <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/70642/">filler</a> <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/80390/">crap</a> so I call it even.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Comics and Updates</h2><time>February 6, 2007</time><div><p>I haven&#39;t been posting here very much lately. Why? Well... I dunno :-P. Firstly, though, I&#39;ll get the comic links up to speed:</p>
<p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/104870/">Plan 4 World Peace</a> (filler)
The Fruit Saga, Parts <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/106143/">1</a>, <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/108024/">2</a>, and <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/110979/">3</a>.</p>
<p>The fruit saga is more or less based on real life. I did purchase a Mac mini with my tax refund and, despite my years of rampant Mac hatred, I must admit that it is a nifty piece of hardware. I do have a copy of Vista installed (thanks to bootcamp), but I haven&#39;t booted out of OS X in several days. I haven&#39;t done much more than piddle around with stuff, but I&#39;m going to start learning the APIs and maybe write a game.</p>
<p>Full Sail, my college of choice, has been &quot;pestering&quot; me lately and I guess I need to call them back and start getting things setup to sail away in the fall. I&#39;m not sure what kind of course I want to take. Back when I heard about them it was game programming hands down, but I do enjoy drawing and would like to do more film projects. It&#39;s a real toss up. I may go with game programming yet because, of those three options, it&#39;s probably my strongest area. We&#39;ll see, though...</p>
<p>As far as work goes, it&#39;s pretty much usual. I&#39;m cashier mostly, but since I recieved my CSM powers I&#39;ve been doing that some too. Just yesterday, in fact, they pulled me off a register to cover for somebody whilst they went on break. I&#39;m sitting in a pretty sweet position in that I can do almost anything in the store from CSMing, to cashiering, to cart pushing, to unloading trucks, etc.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ll close this blog post with a little piece of my art featuring Basch, my favorite character from FFXII:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/basch001.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/basch001.jpg">http://www.dxprog.com/pics/basch001.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/basch001.jpg</a> &quot;Basch - He&#39;ll kick your ass&quot;)[/url]</p>

<p>I actually drew this back towards the beginning of the comic, but I never actually finished it because I didn&#39;t like Jimmy&#39;s running stance. It seems a little out of place now that Jimmy is the straight man, but it&#39;s a comic. I would&#39;ve put the comic I started today up, but I want to spend a little extra time making this series look decent. So there you have it.</p>

<p>Now that that&#39;s out of the way I share yet another piece of my immense, unimaginable past. I&#39;m not sure how many people here are familiar with the old show &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; hosted by Lavar Burton, but this has got to be the best episode teh EVAR. I remember watching this when I was probably about 6-7 years old. Ouch :-P. Enjoy:</p>

<p>Yeah, the first &quot;animated&quot; &quot;comic&quot;. My Stewie Griffin voice is pretty bad.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Updates and whatnot</h2><time>December 9, 2006</time><div><p>So, I haven&#39;t really done any updates on my personal life in a while. Let&#39;s see, since I last blogged I&#39;ve gotten married, had three kids, won a Nobel Peace prize and purchased a Wii. Only one of these things is important, but I&#39;ll leave it to you to figure out.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I did buy a Wii and it is a very nice piece of machinery indeed. Wii Sports is just plain fun and Zelda has me pretty muched hooked. I&#39;ve also played Excite Truck which I&#39;m not overly thrilled with (touchy controls), but this is the beginning and things will get better. Suffice to say it&#39;s one of the coolest machines I&#39;ve purchased since the SNES.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t really said much about work lately (save, it pretty much sucks up my entire life). Over the last few months I&#39;ve expanded my horizons beyond that of normal cashiering. I can work the service desk, layaway (moot point now, more in a sec), automotive, sporting goods, electronics and something new which I will also get to in just a minute.</p>
<p>For anybody who hasn&#39;t read front page news, Wal-Mart has canned layaway, so I was there to see it off today. I went back at 8pm and things were pretty steady up until 9:30 (with two people back there). After the rush I spent the next 45ish minutes doing all the filing for the day. And once I escaped there was when the fun really began.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never mentioned it, but I&#39;ve been hounding the powers that be about becoming a backup CSM (Customer Service Manager, or as I like to call them &quot;Red coats&quot;), but I my progress in getting anywhere close to that goal was slow at best (the biggest caveat being that I didn&#39;t pass the leadership assesment back in July when I was stupid). But, desperate times call for desperate measures and when Debbie (who I&#39;ve erroneously called  the &quot;schedule lady&quot; in the past, she&#39;s actually a support manager) found herself with next to no CSMs to keep the store going for the night made the call to get my status upgraded. Since this was an act of desperation I&#39;m not sure how permanent it&#39;ll be, but it&#39;s a start.</p>
<p>Well, it seems to be 4:30 in the morning. Not sure why I get these blog urges in the middle of the night, but eh. I will now relay the words expressed by Tiny Tim: God bless me, and not you weasels :-D</p>

<p>Okay, it&#39;s a quick pencil sketch but at least there&#39;s a comic.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t comment on Friday&#39;s comment as it&#39;s fairly self explanitory (if you&#39;ve seen Lord of the Rings and are male, that is). So I will bare my soul on today&#39;s comic which touches on a topic very, very close to my heart. Yes... cookies. Anybody who knows me knows that I am the Cookie King. When the holiday baking begins and the cookies are stockpiled in the freezer I begin siphoning deliciousness from this <em>motherlode</em> much to the dismay of everybody else come Christmas day. Would I kill Famous Amos for his <em>ginormous</em> stockpile of chocochunkeroos? Yes... yes I would. And again if I had to!!</p>

<p>Today&#39;s escapade into laziness calls to mind that, yes, I have been working at the mines of Wal-Mart one year today.</p>
<p>And as for keeping the customer&#39;s ignorant, it&#39;s true. We cater to their every whim and at some point, when they can no longer think for themselves, the cashier&#39;s of the earth will rise up and take control and we shall see a new era... an era of peace and prosperity.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Various shit</h2><time>October 20, 2006</time><div><p>Firstly, today&#39;s <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/72069/">comic</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said or not, but I&#39;m currently in the middle of my two week hiatus from Wal-Mart (unpaid, sadly, but I&#39;m not one to quibble when it means two weeks of care free goodness). One of the things I vowed to do in my two weeks of freedom was teach myself how to play piano. Overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s going pretty well and having a keyboard that totally rocks helps ;-). But don&#39;t take my word for it, here&#39;s me playing a little piece of Zelda music (actually, I&#39;ve been passively working on learning this piece for over a year :-P):</p>
<p>[![youtube video](<a href="https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJCFtI9wjcQ">https://img.youtube.com/vi/BJCFtI9wjcQ</a>]</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that by next summer I&#39;ll be proficient enough to play the song in its entirety (without screwing up) along with some others (Final Fantasy X&#39;s [To Zanarkand/0.jpg)](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJCFtI9wjcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJCFtI9wjcQ</a>]</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that by next summer I&#39;ll be proficient enough to play the song in its entirety (without screwing up) along with some others (Final Fantasy X&#39;s [To Zanarkand)(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty8PPnrKY0w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty8PPnrKY0w</a>) being of them).</p>
<p>Speaking of FFX, I am currently enjoying being beaten by the game. The story started off kind of slow (almost to the point of me deciding never to play again), but it&#39;s picked up to the point of having me completely sucked in. So I&#39;ve been playing a bit lately (excluding all my annihilations I believe my play time is somewhere around 26 hours) and hopefully I&#39;ll have beaten the stupid thing before I have to go back to work (at which point I&#39;ll start playing FFX-2).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started on a DS game. That&#39;s all I&#39;ll say because I tend to make these announcements with all sorts of grandiose promises and give up after about five minutes of coding. Yeah... it&#39;s dumb.</p>
<p>Okay, now you&#39;re all caught up for the next several months. I&#39;ll probably post something again before I go to college next fall.</p>

<p>No comment on this one.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that I&#39;ll be going to a once a week Saturday update for a while. Trying to do two comics a week with work and all the other stuff I do is kind of a strain. So, yeah.</p>

<p>Sorry for it being late. I&#39;m now on Linux and I&#39;ve yet to get my scanner or wacom working so making comics is a going to be a little complicated until I do.</p>
<p>Not much to say about the comic, so I won&#39;t.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to update again on Friday. I have some scans that I can  use until I get everything working the way they&#39;re supposed to.</p>
<p>P.S. Comments are working again. I&#39;m just letting wordpress handle it all since I&#39;ve got more spam squashing options there.</p>

I shall just say this: don&#39;t go around deleting things unless you are absolutely, one hundred precent sure they don&#39;t have some sort of low-level hook into your system. And on top of that don&#39;t go stopping services unless you are completely certain you aren&#39;t going to need it. So, yeah.</p>
<p>That all said I won&#39;t be having a comic up today. I&#39;ll probably put something up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Okay, first of all I&#39;m really ticked at myself for spelling crystal wrong in the comic title. Oh, well, I&#39;m too lazy to change it now :-P.</p>
<p>The idea behind this is pretty self-explanitory. Oh, an Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is a darn fun game (not to mention probably the prettiest game I&#39;ve ever seen).</p>
<p>But that&#39;s about all I have to say about that.</p>

<p>I have an incredibly sordid past. Sadly all of these (except the last one, of course) are true. This was during a time when good old GoldenPalace.com would seemingly buy just about anything. So I would track the stories of their purchases and true to stay one step ahead. Didn&#39;t really work. However, I will go into some detail behind each one.</p>
<p>The Common Cold - February of &#39;05, I believe it was, I had a nasty cold. Put me in bed for about a week. Shortly after I got better I decided to try and sell the common cold, one of the &quot;oldest human diseases of all time&quot;. I blew my nose into a tissue, stuffed into a zippy bag and made up a little &quot;facts sheet&quot;. I must&#39;ve still be delerious from that cold :-P.</p>
<p>The Darth Vader Pancake - I&#39;ve had a few people ask how I made the Vader &quot;face&quot; in the pancake. What I did was scratched the design into a piece of aluminum foil, layed that in the bottom of the pan and the parts of the batter that actually connected with the pan wound up darker leaving the Vader impression on the morsel. I believe it was like 2 or 3 in the morning when I did this. Sad to say nbody bought the pancake and I wound up eating it about a week or two after making it. It didn&#39;t really taste that good.</p>
<p>The John Paul II Photomosaic - I basically cover the story in the comic. However, it did take me two or three nights to glean all those religious pictures off of Google image search. Then I just ran everything through some fancy butt software and there it was. I thought I was going to be printing my own money. Not really. The picture sat on our mantle for a while before I reclaimed my frame and put my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/obi_subway.png">Obi-wan Eats at Subway</a> picture in it where it hangs on my wall even to this day.</p>
<p>I have sold other things on eBay (legit and not so much). One thing I attempted to sell was loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com. This was shortly after that xbox 360 address snagged a gob of dough. But, anyhoo, I&#39;ve rambled long enough.</p>

<p>Not trying to be immodest or anything here, but I think this has to be the best joke I&#39;ve done. And, yes, they really did say that in the stupid movie. I&#39;m still of the mind that that whole movie was all faked to some degree or another (aside from the fact that he gained weight). I mean, his first burger, a double quarter pounder or something, took him nearly an hour or so to eat and then he puked it all up? Talk about a girly man. His name is Morgan, so you know I&#39;m right ;-).</p>

<p>Yes, I drew the entire thing in crayon. Crayola&#39;s, even. 64 count box. On black construction paper. Okay, that&#39;s cool.</p>

<p>I mean, hey! Why not? They already have a <a href="http://www.mcphee.com/items/10746.html">Jesus action figure, </a> and there have been religous games. The funny thing about one of those &quot;games&quot; in particular...</p>
<p>I believe it was a Noah game. A nice healthy game for young&#39;ns, only.... you needed a Doom cart to run it.</p>
<p>I actually feel rather... soiled to put this comic up, especially after the <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060911/">one my brother did.</a> Oh, bugger. Screwed again :-P</p>

<p>Yeah, so I bought a PS2. For me, this is a rather huge ordeal because hating the PS2 (or anything Playstation) was like a strange sort of religion. I grew up on Nintendo, everything else was just... well... evil (though, I never had a problem with the xbox, go figure).</p>
<p>So, yeah, I bought a PS2 for Guitar Hero which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. It&#39;s kind of like DDR for your fingers, but also has some really great music to boot. From great oldies to some new stuff (like &quot;All of This&quot; by Shaimus). Currently I&#39;m making my way through hard mode which is quite a challenge (especially when the devil pinky won&#39;t cooperate).</p>
<p>I do have some more stuff in mind for my little PS2 (emphesis on the little as I got a slim). I bought the Gameshark media player for it which&#39;ll stream my videos over the network (very sweet) and, of course, I&#39;ll invest in Guitar Hero 2. And probably the Final Fantasy titles I&#39;ve missed since VI for the SNES (which will always be my favorite, though).</p>
<p>Ah, well, I got a little long winded. Guess I&#39;m enjoying this PS2 thing more than I thought I would ;-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>This man needs help... and drugs :-P</h2><time>September 3, 2006</time><div><p>Recently, there was a story on digg about a website run on old Apple Lisa 2 computers. The guy running the site made it sound like they were all &quot;tricked out&quot;, if you will. Intrigued, I e-mailed him asking what was under the hood. His e-mail, apparently a pre-written response, was a fitting answer to a thread going on in the story&#39;s comments, so I answered them with the text of the e-mail I got.</p>
<p>Enter zulhadm.</p>
<p>Apparently this guy also e-mailed and got the same reply. My comment was digged up, his was dugg down (despite what he may say, my comment was posted way before his). He was mad. So, he started making slanderous remarks, starting out on my own blog:</p>
<p>&quot;Matt you suck. You take other people&#39;s work on digg and pass it as if its your own. Learn RESPECT &quot;</p>
<p>I thought maybe it had something to do with me posting a link on digg of Chris&#39; Reggie Pic of the Week. I had no idea that he&#39;d posted that comment on digg. So, all was good. Until I get an e-mail from senior usb. This guy was so pissed he posted <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Diary_of_a_BAD_programmer">this</a> on digg:</p>
<p><strong>Diary of a BAD programmer</strong></p>
<p>DO NOT HIRE HIM. Known as &quot;Matt Hackmann&quot; to the net community this sketchy, untrustworthy character has no business working in the IT Industry. I added some very relevant information to the following digg story: <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/">http://digg.com/tech_news/</a> Site_hosted_on_two_23_year_old_Lisa2_computers Matt took credit for the added info when it wasn&#39;t his!!!!</p>
<p>So, in the end, he made himself look like a class-A asshole. And all of it over a little comment. Wow, this is one eff-d up world.</p>

<p>Anybody who watched Nickelodeon around the turn of the century will remember these Verb commercials, a ploy by the government to try to get fatass kids outside and active. One commercial in particular told you to &quot;pick a verb&quot;. Now, a verb is a word that expresses action or a state of being, not just something that denotes physical activity. There was an episode of Family Ties that had a rather humorous bit about how die could be a verb. But, I digress. If you go to the Verb <a href="http://www.verbnow.com">website</a> there&#39;s this creepy green chick dancing up in the top, left corner. I bet she chose smoke as her verb.</p>

<p>So our tale of love and romance comes to a crashing conclusion... literally. Actually, this was the idea that inspired the whole idea in the first place.</p>
<p>It should be duly noted that Master Chief&#39;s real name is in fact John (or John-117). In the original comic it was just Chief, but at the prompting of a friend of mine it was changed to John. I figured he ought to know as he&#39;s finished both games and read the books (whereas I&#39;m not even halfway through the first game. I just play multiplayer all the time).</p>
<p>I was thinking about having a Cortana episode where she&#39;s jealous and such, but drawing Master Chief is kind of a bitch (as you probably have figured out) so I&#39;m wrapping it up here.</p>

<p>I decided that &quot;The Plagiarist&quot; will be a reccurring series instead of blowing the whole thing at once. This&#39;ll allow me to do many more comics.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s subject, however, is something that has been peeving my off quite a bit lately. Idiots just don&#39;t know how to swipe their credit cards and, for that matter, just expect you to spoonfeed them the answers to everything.

<p>As the title suggest, however, I have made another video. It&#39;s mainly just a fancy edit job of an otherwise fairly boring, yet monumental, event. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Okay, so I cheated a little on this one. However, in my defense, I&#39;m winding up a 6 day run at work with no break in between so what free time I have had I&#39;ve spent doing other stuff. I promise that Friday&#39;s will be a good one (it&#39;s the one with the &quot;complex&quot; artwork I mentioned earlier).</p>

<p>I am actually a fairly large fan of Peanuts (at least, pre-80s Peanuts). However, one thing that drove me insane was that Charlie Brown never stood up for himself. He allowed his life to be a constant joke to everybody and everything around him. He should&#39;ve taken Plankton&#39;s advice and asserted himself as he does here.</p>
<p>Interesting side note, there&#39;s currently a manager at Wal-Mart whose name is Charlie Brown (seriously, what were those parents thinking :-P).</p>

<p>Tomorrow&#39;s comic will probably be a little late (possibly into Saturday morning) because of the complexity of the artwork. I have it currently about half drawn, so I&#39;ll probably doodle out the rest tonight and get it colored and junk tomorrow. So, sorry about that. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see... I&#39;m still a cashier/cart pusher. I&#39;m enjoying Halo&#39;s online play immensely. I&#39;m almost to the floating continent on FFVI. I enjoy going to college with Elvis on the weekends, and I&#39;m thinking of moving out. Yes, you read that correctly, I&#39;m going to college with Elvis ;-).</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I am making plans for moving out of the house and into an apartment. A couple of hurdles I need to get over are lack of GED and car, but otherwise I think I&#39;m in a finacially tenable position to pull it off. Jeff also wants to move out and board with me, which would be cool. I&#39;m already dreaming of the awesome Smash Bros. game-a-thon parties I could host.... oh, yeah.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Joystiq! Whooo!</h2><time>July 23, 2006</time><div><p>It seems my comic has finally gained a little bit of recognition. That&#39;s right, I was featured on this week&#39;s <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/22/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-16-22-2006">webcomic pick of the week</a> poll on <a href="http://www.joystiq.com">Joystiq</a>. Not only that, however, but people actually commented on it (see comments 11-13, 12 is my favorite). Now, I can&#39;t brag too much because Chris has been on <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/10/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-june-4-10-2006/">there</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/15/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-9-15-2006/">twice</a>. Still, it&#39;s a pretty awesome feeling to be noticed on one of the internet&#39;s biggest game news sites. Anyhoo, since I&#39;ll be having guests I&#39;ve gone through all the trouble of pulling together the RSS feed for the comic (use the icon above, or IE7&#39;s handy little dropdown box).</p>

<p>Alright, first off the name&#39;s changed from F5 to Digital Double. Why? Well, I believe that more accurately reflects the intent of the strip as it&#39;s supposed to loosely be based off my life (my digital double). So that&#39;s that.</p>
<p>As for the comic itself, that stemmed from a <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/headlines/H_3155/35.shtml#headline">crack</a> induced conversation I had with devusb last week. This happens quite often. It&#39;s kind of scary...</p>

<p>Anyways, I have good news! And, no, I didn&#39;t save a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico. No, it seems that my laptop has FINALLY been repaired (going on over a month now, I believe). From the repair center: &quot;repaired- replaced fl inverter, fixed latch,and cleaned heatsink,very&quot;. It seems I got everything I asked for and thensome, though the  heatsink was very what? Very big? Very sexy? Very... whatever?! I dunno.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I finally managed to snag that which I have been seeking my entire life. The very purpose of man&#39;s existance. The driving force of all creatures... a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44121975@N00/191885027/">Super Nintendo Entertainment System!!</a> (in box, even). Of course, no SNES is complete without the greatest game ever made... FINAL FANTASY VI!!! Ah, the sweet, sweet days of care free gaming, when all was right in the world.... it&#39;s a pity those days are gone.</p>
<p>Ah, well. I shall be off with sweet dreams of snes&#39;s and laptops in my head :-)</p>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s quite a year. I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m far more mature now than I was this time last year, at least I&#39;m a tad wiser. Well, it&#39;s 4:30am and I really should be in bed. See ya</p>

<p>It&#39;s been over three weeks since I&#39;ve posted a comic so I decided to drag the wacom downstairs and make it on the parents&#39; computer. Speaking of which, there was no pencil work for this one. It was all sketched out digtally. That tablet rocks!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>New Design Coming!</h2><time>July 7, 2006</time><div><p>A while back I worked up a new design for the site and I&#39;ve been working on getting it finished the last few days. Comment posting still doesn&#39;t work and the &quot;My Digg&quot; bar is broken, but I think this is probably one of the best designs I&#39;ve had in a while. But don&#39;t take my word for it, <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/new_design.png">see for yourselves.</a> The comic page is also done in this style, though it&#39;s not quite working yet.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Sketches, oh joy</h2><time>July 4, 2006</time><div><p>No laptop and as such I am forced to put up more random selections of my artwork.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/alien.png" alt="" title="image">
This is actually some concept art for an upcoming comic. I&#39;m trying to work more emotion into the characters&#39; body language.</p>

<p>Well, there you are. One semi-interesting thing to note is that Captain Haddock is the only drawing here done with a no. 2 pencil. Everything else was done using my wonderful 0.7 Pentel mechanical pencil. Oh, it is a thing of beauty :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Tryin&#x27; to survive</h2><time>June 30, 2006</time><div><p>No laptop yet. I&#39;d check to see how things were coming on Toshiba&#39;s website, but I don&#39;t have my service order number or anything (left it at the UPS store :-P) so I&#39;ll just have to be pleasently surprised when it gets here. Driving me nuts, though, because my bros&#39; computer is fritzin&#39; out so I&#39;m having to resort to other &quot;activities&quot; to keep me entertained. Mainly drawing. Actually, I&#39;d like to think that my artwork has evolved quite a bit since even the last comic I made (before the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54184/">Paint Chronicles</a>, that is).</p>
<p>Speaking of the comic, I&#39;ve got a bunch of ideas lined up and ready to go. I&#39;ve got the last part to the DB of Life about half colored, another one scanned and a couple others I&#39;ve drawn over the last few days. Another thing I&#39;m going to do when my laptop gets back is redesign the F5 part of the website. It&#39;s kind of bland looking now, and apparently script <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/">isn&#39;t working</a> (that&#39;s supposed to take you to the Paint Chronicles).</p>
<p>I&#39;m planning on going to see Pirates 2 in a couple weeks. Tried to watch the first one the other night, but our DVD is scratched or something so we only got about half way through. While I&#39;m on the subject of motion picture entertainment, I&#39;ve started watching Lost. Not too bad of a show, really. A little gorey, but intruiging. And finally, they released the teaser for the new Spider-man... I am not amused. Three (at least) bad guys, Harry included which burns me to no end, and it looks like they&#39;re going to toss MJ aside like a bag of moldy tangerines. Sam Raimi, ya screwed up!</p>
<p>Work&#39;s not going too bad. I got a raise a couple weeks ago, so I&#39;m netting a nice sum of money every other week. I&#39;m scheduled to push carts all next week, which I&#39;m thankful for as I&#39;ll miss the pre-4th of July rush. I&#39;ve also got three day weekends coming the next two weeks so life is good. Gives me plenty of time to do all I&#39;ve talked about above ;-).</p>
<p>Speaking of money, next week on one of my days off, I think I&#39;m going to trot down to the bank and see about getting a loan so I can get my car. I can&#39;t even get a stupid credit card because I have no credit score, so we&#39;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Well, that should catch everything up for a while (it&#39;s been forever since I last blogged like that :-P). I may try to import all my old blog posts to WordPress when my laptop gets back, as well. It would seem fitting as I&#39;ve now been filling you all in on the useless details of my life for over a year now. It&#39;s been one crazy, crazy year, too. House renovation, moving, job, and all of it forever immortalized on the Internet. Cheers!</p>

<p>While we&#39;re on the subject, yeah, I&#39;ll probably see Cars sometime next week on one of my days off. But I&#39;ll dress normal, thank you very much.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s been a while</h2><time>June 9, 2006</time><div><p>Save the comic posts and podcast, it&#39;s been a little bit since I&#39;ve written anything. So I guess I&#39;ll start by dropping this bomb: Hi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as many know, I turned the magical 20. I can&#39;t even be called a teenager anymore, so basically all my ties with kiddom have been severed. Though, that hasn&#39;t stopped me from watching a cartoon I used to tune in to religously every morning: <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70045113&amp;trkid=189530&amp;strkid=11816394_1_0">The Super Mario Super Show</a>. The show itself actually isn&#39;t all the bad once you get past the fact that Bowser was named King Koopa back then and that the live action stuff oozes 80s. <em>sniff</em> It was a golden age.</p>
<p>Back to the present, however, I&#39;ve been considering selling off my old NES collection and buying a used Xbox off eBay. The way I see it, not only would I be able to play Halo 2, but I&#39;d probably soft-mod the thing and then I could run the stuff on emulator  (of games I own, mind you). Also, I could use the all powerful <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">Xbox Media Center (XBMC)</a>. The more I read about the thing the more I drool. It&#39;ll play basically any video/audio file you feed from anywhere (including the network). Talk about sweet justice.</p>
<p>In work related news, not much new. However, I believe I am going to become a lowly cart pusher. Now I know there are some questions on your mind, namely: But isn&#39;t that cut in pay? Won&#39;t you bake out in the sun? I wonder if this candy bar I found under the couch is still edible? The answers are yes, yes and you&#39;ll probably die if you eat it. Actually, three little words sum things up: shorts and free gatorade (wait, that&#39;s four...) But, I digress. I&#39;ve always had more fun outside than inside and being stuck behind the register drives me insane (mainly the not moving part). I need to be moving and doing something. Take now for instance. My fingers are moving all over the place whilst my lazy butt relaxes in bed.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I&#39;ll get to bed now. I&#39;ll try to have the comic finished and posted before I go to work tomorrow, otherwise look for it in the wee hours of Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Aside from the outcome, this comic is absolultely, 100% true right down to the thought process going on in my head. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve zoned out on what I was doing to focus on whatever programming problem faced me at the time, but it&#39;s pretty sad.</p>

<p>Remember how I said I&#39;d update every Monday and Friday? Yeah, well, I&#39;m starting today.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>DDR Mania</h2><time>May 20, 2006</time><div><p>Well, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be the one to be sucked in by this, but I&#39;m now hooked on DDR (Mario style). Actually, it&#39;s an incredibly satisfying game once you really get going. Not only are you burning calories faster than Bill Clinton could put them on, but it&#39;s also insanely fun at the same time. Yeah... get DDR... lose weight... have fun...</p>
<p>Not sure if I&#39;ve said anything about being cashier again, but I&#39;m definitely glad I came back. I get to see all my old pals again and I get to sleep through the entire morning (not like I have :-P). However, one night they had me helping i grocery again. I was dragging palettes of frozen food taller than myself all over the place and that&#39;s scarier than any other palette dragging I&#39;ve done so far (especially when there&#39;s customers around).</p>
<p>Got my copy of New Mario Bros. last Tuesday and I&#39;ll say this: The 11 year wait for a new Mario platformer was well worth it. If feels a lot like Mario World and Mario 3 rolled together. The only gripe I have so far is that as far as I&#39;ve seen there&#39;s nothing to make Mario fly :-(.</p>
<p>And, on a side note, after today I&#39;m changing the F5 release schedule to Monday and Friday. Now that my evening is occupied by work again I don&#39;t have as much time to work on the comic.</p>

<p>And with that I&#39;m all caught up until Saturday, yay! :-)</p>

<p>A littel late, but there you have it. You definitely have to have been listening to diggnation the last few weeks to get this one.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s time for Name.. that.. Star!!</h2><time>May 16, 2006</time><div><p>While digging through the site of an unamed famous celebrity, I found this interesting picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/acf74la.jpg" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>So, can you figure out who it is? Here&#39;s a little hint:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/some_guy.jpg" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>Whoever correctly guesses the person gets a shout out in the next podcast (coming this Thursday, it&#39;ll be good. Trust me).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>BEST... COMIC... EVAR!</h2><time>May 14, 2006</time><div><p>I&#39;m not sure how many of you (all three of ya) saunter over to <a href="http://www.revo-news.frih.net/">my bro&#39;s site</a>, but if you don&#39;t you&#39;re really missing out because it is home to one of the best web comics on the net (and I&#39;m not just saying that to be nice). <a href="http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060515/">Today&#39;s comic</a> is what made me say &quot;Hey! I need to share this with people!&quot;. So go check it out, keep checking it out, it&#39;s all good.</p>
<p>As for my own comic don&#39;t expect the next one till Tuesday. I don&#39;t even have the thing scribbled out on paper yet let alone coloered and all that malarkey :-P.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>F5 - &quot;Digged 2 - The Dugg and the Restless&quot; (link fixed)</h2><time>May 13, 2006</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54173/">Comic</a></p>
<p>Note - I was originally going to call Kevin a mustard in that last frame (only not quite as nice), however, I thought it would be more in character for him to swear.</p>
<p>Note 2 - Oh, and since I don&#39;t know what the heck Keith looks like, I decided to have Gabe from <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> make a cameo appearance. I may do things like that from time to time. &#39;Tis fun ;-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>F5 - &quot;Digged - Part 1&quot;</h2><time>May 9, 2006</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54172/">Comic</a></p>
<p>Warning: For this series of strips you really need to be a <a href="http://www.diggnation.com/">diggnation</a> listener to get the jokes.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Wii-Ha!!</h2><time>May 9, 2006</time><div><p>As I write this it is seven hours until Nintendo&#39;s E3 press conference and I tell you I&#39;m currently wide awake riding a wave of excitement (which is bad because I have to work today :-P). If you&#39;ve been paying attention to gaming news in the last few hours you&#39;ll know that Sony tried to pull a fast one and copy Nintendo&#39;s motion sensing stuff (a move I called a while back, sadly it wasn&#39;t on the podcast :-P). Also, you&#39;ll know that the cheapest you can get a PS3 for is $500 bucks, and that version doesn&#39;t even come with built-in wifi. I will say this only once: Sony is going to fester in their own turds this next generation.</p>
<p>But on to more current news. Next Monday we&#39;ll finally see the release of the first Mario Bros. game since Yoshi&#39;s Island (1995, I believe). From everything I&#39;ve seen this game is going to be absolutely awesome and from the reviews it seems that it lives up to standards Nintendo set back in the 80s and 90s. I have every intention of picking up my copy Monday.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all for now. Oh, yeah, cashiering rocks ;-). I must try to get some sleep if I expect to be awake for the press conference. Night!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>F5 - &quot;Smokey Krispies&quot;</h2><time>May 7, 2006</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54171/">Comic</a></p>
<p>This is one thing I&#39;ve never understood: Why the heck does Smokey Bear wear jeans and no shirt? He&#39;s a bear for crying out loud, he can run around nude :-P. Or if you&#39;re going to clothe <em>half</em> of him, why not the other half? IIRC, 20th Centruy Fox wanted to do the same thing to Chewie.... idiots :-P</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Well, today is the end of the beginning...</h2><time>May 6, 2006</time><div><p>Eh? Whatever :-P</p>
<p>Today, at roughly 4pm CDT, I return to my old job of cashiering. Am I excited? Am I looking forward to it? I&#39;ll just tell you one thing: I&#39;ve saved out my hawaiian SpongeBob shirt just for the occasian (i.e. hell, yes). I just hope I remember how to work the stupid register :-P</p>
<p>In other news, I got the graphics tablet I ordered up on Wednesday and I must say, it is a thing of beauty (and hance a joy forever). Today&#39;s comic was colored and highlighted using it and I have to say it&#39;s probably one of the best things I&#39;ve done so far. About the comic itself it seems that the style <em>is</em> finally coming together (i.e. I&#39;m satisfied with it at the moment). I&#39;ve already got Monday&#39;s comic finished and have ideas for a couple weeks to come. I&#39;m so sucked into this at the moment I barely had time to finish coding the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/">comic viewer</a>. From now on all my updates will be done over there so if you want to keep up on the comics add that to your favorites (I&#39;ll add in an RSS feed sometime within a week).</p>
<p>Also, for those who may not have gotten the hint, I am now legally licensed to drive in the state of Oklahoma. The test was brief, but nerve racking and I was only coached on a couple of minor points. So to date I&#39;ve driven twice on my own: once to take my homies to the library, and last night to take my homies to go bowling (my &quot;homies&quot; being Jeff and Chris). And despite the fact that money keeps slipping through my fingers I&#39;ve got enough of it stored up to make a nice down payment on a car, so that&#39;ll be coming down the road fairly soon (if you&#39;ll pardon the pun).</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve been up for way too long now and I need to get some rest if I&#39;m going to be in decent shape for work this afternoon.</p>

</div></article><article><h2>May 6th, 2006 - The Circle is Complete</h2><time>April 29, 2006</time><div><p>Yeah, Star Wars VII is coming to theaters! YAY! No, seriously, it&#39;s only coming to DVD ;-)</p>
<p>May 6th, as I predicted, I will be back at the old register again. Thank goodness :-P. My sleep &quot;schedule&quot; as of late has been so screwed it&#39;s not funny. Also, I have yet to take the driving test. Tuesday and Wednesday I slept right through 7am and Thursday I spent my entire 15 minute break trying to ge through, to no avail :-P. So I&#39;m going to try again this week and hopefully I&#39;ll luck out.</p>
<p>Speaking of circles, my interests seem to be changing again. The last time this happened was in 1997 when I was introduced to computers. Now I seem to be getting back to my roots in art... with computers of course ;-). The whole comic thing sparked my intrest again and I&#39;m left wondering why I quit in the first place. I take that back, I quit because a) I couldn&#39;t get my frackin&#39; pencil drawings to look like the book, b) I thought there was no money in it. I&#39;ve figured both things out: pencil drawings suck, and I can make a killing as a graphics artist. I spent most of this afternoon redesigning my character in my comic and this is what I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/F5_MattWalMart.png" alt="" title="image">
Me in my &quot;little vest&quot;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/F5_BadAssKnight.png" alt="" title="image">
Bad Ass Jedi Knight Matt</p>
<p>As you can see the hair is more normal now, the glasses shrank and I&#39;ve switched to a harder shading style (the airbrush thing was just a pain in the butt). All this arty stuff has made me realize one thing: painting with a mouse is murder. That said, this coming pay check I&#39;m going to invest in a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16883100021">graphics tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve rambled on long enough. I probably need to be getting to bed here soon as there&#39;s another early day tomorrow :-P.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>F5 - &quot;Chuck Roast&quot;</h2><time>April 26, 2006</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54166/">Comic</a></p>
<p>Enjoy :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Let the Countdown Begin...</h2><time>April 24, 2006</time><div><p>It is once again my weekend (yay!). Work the last few days hasn&#39;t been nearly as bad as it had been, but still icky all the same. This morning was rather interesting, however. The district manager came to pay a visit today and the place was abuzz making sure everything was neat, organized, etc. It&#39;s kind of like what most college kids do when their parents come over: let things slide till the man shows up.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I e-mailed my supervisor yesterday (yeah, I&#39;ve got corporate e-mail. &#39;Tis cool) and asked him exactly when I&#39;d be going back to cashiering, and, thank heavens, he said probably between the first and fifth of May. I&#39;d personally figured on the sixth since it begins a new work week, but the earlier the better :-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be getting up early tomorrow and try to get my appointment in for the driving test again. Hopefully I&#39;ll be luckier than I was last week. If that fails I&#39;ll try again on Wednesday. I&#39;m really itching to get the thing because then I work on getting my spice orange Chevy Aveo:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gmbuypower.com//images/gmbp/13001/vehicle/2006/med/203_258L.gif" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>&#39;Tis sweet, no?</p>
<p>I bought the new DS &quot;game&quot; Brain Age the other day and I have got to say it is one of the sweetest things I&#39;ve played in some time. My current brain age is 28, 20 being the ideal, down from 55 a couple days ago currently beating everybody else who&#39;s got a profile on my card (Mom, Jeff, and Chris). I&#39;ve also discovered Sudoku. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve scoffed at it all this time because it&#39;s very similiar to MasterMind in terms of solving it. However, I still like MasterMind. IT RAWKS!!</p>

<p>Alright, it&#39;s way early but I&#39;ve been working really hard on it the last couple days and I wasn&#39;t about to wait several more just to post it :-P. Anyhoo, I hope you enjoy (and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll enjoy the interesting stream of comments this&#39;ll generate....)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>T3h L33ts Delay</h2><time>April 23, 2006</time><div><p>As you&#39;ve noticed I never posted the new podcast last Thursday. Now it&#39;s not because we didn&#39;t record it, we did. However, for those who&#39;ve listened to Ep II my voice started echoing the further it went on. This was due to the fact that both linkman and myself were recording seperate tracks and his mic picks up everything (including Katie yammering in the background). So we&#39;re waiting for linkman&#39;s headset to come in. Hopefully we&#39;ll make this Thursday or Friday.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>F5 - &quot;L4m0r the Hedgehog&quot;</h2><time>April 22, 2006</time><div><p><a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54098/">Comic</a></p>
<p>There you have it, the very first strip of F5. I&#39;m pretty pleased, though I need to get more consistent about my drawing and move to a more standard size. But, nothing starts off perfect :-P. Enjoy :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>New Webcomic by Yours Truly</h2><time>April 21, 2006</time><div><p>It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been hankering to do for quite some time now (ever since I started reading <a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/">CAD</a>, really). Jeff&#39;s been making them for some time now (he should be posting them on this blog at some point) and Chris has had his Hackfam&#39;s for years. So now I bring to you F5, the &quot;adventures&quot; of two programmers:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/f5/F5_panel.png" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>I&#39;m working on completing the first strip and hopefully I&#39;ll have it posted some time tomorrow or Sunday. It&#39;ll probably be a weekly thing as getting the comic pulled together is an incredibly time consuming process. Stay tuned for more :-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>MyTube</h2><time>April 21, 2006</time><div><p>If you haven&#39;t heard of or or seen something on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> yet you must be living under a rock. Where it came from and why it&#39;s suddenly so popular I don&#39;t know, however I do know a promising technology when I see one (like the iPod and the x86 processor) so I joined the bandwagon. I uploaded my Vader&#39;s Day &quot;trailer&quot; as a test, so here it is:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkwPzYp0xb0"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/LkwPzYp0xb0/0.jpg" alt="youtube video"></a></p>
<p>One nice thing is that I&#39;ll be able to save some space and bandwidth this way. I&#39;ll probably release YAVP on YouTube as well (and other verious video projects). Well, enjoy :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My Desk - An in Depth Analysis</h2><time>April 19, 2006</time><div><p>Today I plan on cleaning the nuclear waste site that is my desk. But before I do that I figured I&#39;d post a &quot;before&quot; picture along with an in-depth analysis of what&#39;s on/around it. So, here we go:</p>
<p>[url=<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/my_desk_dirty.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/thumb.php?file=pics/my_desk_dirty.jpg&amp;size=320">http://www.dxprog.com/pics/my_desk_dirty.jpg]![](http://www.dxprog.com/thumb.php?file=pics/my_desk_dirty.jpg&amp;size=320</a>&quot; &quot;My Dirty Desk&quot;)[/url]</p>
<p>1) My laptop (under a couple of spindles of CDs, goodness knows what&#39;s on them)
2) My DS (under a rejection letter from Capital One :-P)
3) Camcorder
4) An empty cup. Probably had ice water in it at one time.
5) A pile of clean jeans under which is a box I still haven&#39;t unpacked from the move.
6) Library books (Dave Barry&#39;s Money $ecrets and Heir to the Empire to be exact)
7) Trash can (notice how it&#39;s empty?)
8) My financial crab
9) My bed
10) My headset (dutifully bringing you l33ts every week)
11) Some cables, a GBASP headset and various other junk
12) Easter candy, a pile of blank DVD-Rs, my CD case (mainly emtpy), a change sorter, my cell phone, both pairs of glasses <em>deep breath</em>, a socket set, a phone book, my GameCube memory card, and a lightbulb.
13) This is where my GBA and DS stuff is supposed to go. Mainly it&#39;s games and trash now
14) My Mario picture (lovingly hand stitched by grandma)
Pretty sad, eh? Well, this is my pet project for the remainder of the day (which means no work on YAVP for now), however, I will not let that get in the way of dutifully bringing you the next episode of t3h l33ts. Assuming I can get this whole thing clean I&#39;ll post the &quot;after&quot; picture tomorrow. Until then....</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My Life</h2><time>April 17, 2006</time><div><p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last blogged mainly because a) I forgot and b) I was in a deep blue funk. But now I&#39;m feeling quite chipper for two reasons: a) I&#39;m going back to cashiering again in May, b) I&#39;ve been selected to join the <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/">ACC</a> Site Improvement Committee. For anybody who&#39;s paid attention, ACPD has been one of my major ongoing projects for the last two years. Now that I am officially connected to the site I&#39;ll be able to push it more and perhaps replace their existing flash editor with <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/acpd/">ACPD Online</a>.</p>
<p>I have yet to call the DMV, however I have been driving again lately and I&#39;m not as rusty as I thought. I WILL CALL TOMORROW!!! Okay, that&#39;s out.</p>
<p>Also, I have YAVP (yet another video project) of which should actually be seeing the light of day. However, I cannot at this time divulge any information aside from that it&#39;s the most expensive project to date. I have spent eighty whole cents on props (my gosh!). I may put the trailer up here soon, but I want to try to get the entire project finished. Also, I&#39;ve been thinking of rewriting Ramboella and filming that now that I&#39;m more buff than I was six months ago. More later...</p>
<p>Finally, before I go, I need to hand out gold stars. One to devusb for properly naming the &quot;Vista blows&quot;, a play off of some lyrics in the Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie song &quot;Every OS Sucks&quot;, and one to linkman2004 for getting the &quot;winds of change quote&quot; of which was uttered by Randall in Monster&#39;s Inc. (and again sarcasticly by Mike). Congratulations and keep your eyes peeled (hint: there&#39;s one in this post). Happy hunting, and happy belated Easter :-).</p>

<p>Clocking in ten minutes longer than last week&#39;s podcast, it&#39;s worth the listen (I hope, haven&#39;t actually listened to it myself :-P). Go ahead and check it out: <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/l33ts/podcasts/l33ts2.mp3">Direct Link</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=141651439&amp;s=143441">iTunes</a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>For the sailors</h2><time>April 10, 2006</time><div><p>Do you have a filty mouth? Should your mouth perpetually have a bar of soap strapped to it? Well then you&#39;re reading the right column. Hi, I&#39;m Dr. Matt.</p>
<p>Over the last three years my team and I have come up with a simple solution to all swearing problems. It is a simple matter of appended or prepending letters or phrases onto said bad word to make it kid friendly. Let&#39;s have an example:</p>
<p> &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t sound very nice, does it? Now let&#39;s see the same phrase after applying Dr. Matt&#39;s pateneted cuss removing technology.</p>
<p> &quot;What the shell is that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Much nicer, no? The following table contains a list of beautified words that you can use any day in front of anybody (except the pope): </p>
<p>bass
mustard
witch/itch
ship
crab
freak/frickin&#39; (funk has also been suggested, but that burders too close...)</p>
<p>In certain situations a letter won&#39;t work and you will actually have to say the word, however, after much research it was found that the word &quot;Hoover&quot; can aleviate sid problem. Examples:</p>
<p>Hoover Dam
sucks like a Hoover</p>
<p>Ans there you have it. Practice these steps everyday and you&#39;ll be on the road to verbal maturity in no time. Have a great day :-)</p>

<p>UPDATE: We&#39;re on <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=141651439&amp;s=143441">iTunes</a>! Whooo!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>You hear that? It&#x27;s the winds of change...</h2><time>April 5, 2006</time><div><p>In what could be marked as a pardigm shift for me I have purchased my first &quot;real&quot; song off of iTunes, meaning it is a modern rock song. Now the song, which I will name, I&#39;ve heard plenty of times at Wal-Mart (as much as one can hear it over <em>beep</em> <em>beep</em> <em>beep</em> and all the chatter), but I suppose I have devusb to thank for it in the end. Using some iTunes VPN thingy I was digging through his music this morn and I was able to listen to the entire song and found, horror of horrors, I actually liked it. This leads me to wonder if I shouldn&#39;t broaden my musical horizons just a hair.... But anyhoo, you&#39;re probably wondering what song could cause such a cataclysmic shift in such a humble being as myself. It&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=73648639&amp;s=143441&amp;i=73648643">Dirty Little Secret</a>&quot; by the All-American Rejects.</p>
<p>In job news I am going to be blunt and to the point: the deptartment managing specialist job SUCKS! That said I am going to beg to have my cashier job back by May. I can&#39;t stand this job anymore. The hours (and lack thereof) stink, the lack of human interaction is driving me insane and a couple of other reasons I will leave unsaid (to save my job and reputation). Had I realized that this is how things were going to be I would have stopped complaining about my cashier job and been happy. We&#39;ll see how things go down, though.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for now. In about fifteen minutes I have to be at the eye doctor&#39;s for an appointment. Stay tuned for my next post where I&#39;ll do a little bit of ranting again (yay! ;-)).</p>
<p>PS - Gold stars to anybody who can name the quotes I&#39;ve been stuffing into my posts lately.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Windows Vista Blows...</h2><time>April 1, 2006</time><div><p>...and sucks, at the same time!</p>
<p>Yesterday I thought it would be &quot;fun&quot; to test drive the beta of Microsoft&#39;s latest and &quot;greatest&quot; OS, Windows Vista. Hah! It&#39;s slow, it&#39;s incomplete and it gives Windows a bad name (wait....). And even worse, when I went to install XP again the Vista file permissions and junk remained so nothing worked. So I had to back my crud up, reformat my hard drive and start from scratch. As of this moment I&#39;m running without SP2 which is probably suicide :-P.</p>
<p>In work related news, I moved up again. A couple days ago I helped to resolve a rather sticky customer situation and the manager&#39;s were so impressed that I&#39;ve been offered to be promoted to support manager. This would give me the option of moving back to days which would thrill me to no end. However, having nothing but gripey customers <em>and</em> employees to look forward to would be like belly flopping into the bowls of hell. So I&#39;m still thinking about it. I did get some good news in my current job. Michael Jordan (no relation to the basketball player) is getting his hours changed so I won&#39;t be alone in the back which will be nice. It&#39;ll actually be possible to get everything done.</p>
<p>Well, I need to go upstairs and get SP2 installing (stupid butthead needs to be plugged in :-P). Until next time, happy April Fools :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The momentum of motivation is picking up...</h2><time>March 28, 2006</time><div><p>I really need to quit with the &quot;...&quot; in the title :-P.</p>
<p>I am old. I know I don&#39;t look it, but I can feel it in my heart of hearts. Why, I feel all thin, sort of <em>stretched</em>, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can&#39;t be right. I need a change, or something. In almost two months I&#39;m going to be twenty and what do I have to show for it? A job, sure (more juicy on this in a sec), but as of yet no driver&#39;s license, no high school diploma and not much of a plan for the rest of my life. Well, having been kind of depressed the last few days I&#39;ve decided to do something about it. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to schedule a driving test for next week and a testing date for the GED (probably sometime in late April, early May). I am bound and determined to accomplish at least these two things before my teenage years are forever behind me.</p>
<p>Now, the juicy details. As you all know I am working in groceries labelling overstock and putting it on shelves in a position I&#39;d since been calling &quot;Overstock Manager&quot;. Well, I recieved my official designation Saturday: Grocery ICS (Inventory Control Specialist). While being a &quot;specialist&quot; is cool and all the real interesting part happened yesterday. I recieved an e-mail from one of my old layaway/cashier pals Blake congratulating me on my promotion to department manager. I laughed it off and told him he had the wrong guy, but this morning when I was doing training modules it had me listed under two job codes: ICS Team and Department Manager (dept. 92, dry grocery). It&#39;s so nice when they tell me these things :-P. In not even five months I&#39;ve gone from a lowly layaway runner to a department managing specialist. I figure if things continue at this rate I&#39;ll be CEO of the company by the time my first year anniversary rolls around ;-).</p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s no more interesting news to report and thus I will sign off and go eat some food. Peace out.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A Revolution is on our Doorstep</h2><time>March 22, 2006</time><div><p>Today, with any luck, we&#39;ll get a whole mess of new info from Nintendo on the Revolution. Of course, I&#39;ll be at work :-P. But, the whole reason I post this (aside from the fact that I&#39;m a Nintendo fan boy) is because of a <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2686716?htv=12">little cartoon</a> my bro found. Actually, that last part is very true. On a side note, the soundtrack is awesome!</p>
<p>This is sad, I tell you. I&#39;ve got to go to work at 8am this morning and here it is almost 1:30am and I&#39;m awake talking about how the Revolution will r0x0r. You can tell that I have virtually no life at all. I spent most of yesterday afternoon writing a little RSS <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/patternrss.php?user=dxprog">feed generator</a> to keep track of my <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/patterns.asp?UserLogin=dxprog">ACC pattern stats</a>. Albiet it was kind of fun, but a total waste of time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I also tried out <a href="http://www.americasarmy.com">America&#39;s Army</a>, a free game developed by, surprise, the Army. The basic training missions were okay (especially the shoot house), but after that things just died off (like learning how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation :-P). It was informative, but things like that are best left to the classroom. The complete lack of any single player missions was what turned me off in the end. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t expect anything more coming from the Army, but games aren&#39;t supposed to be real life replicas of boot camp :-P. At least now I can tell these army recruiters who come to Wal-Mart &quot;I played the game and I didn&#39;t like it.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I really must try to get some sleep now. Just remember, nitro-glycerin is incredibly dangerous and unsafe to drink :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s rant time, yay!</h2><time>March 21, 2006</time><div><p>First off, however, I would like to mention that I have, to some degree, started my new job. I say it that way because I&#39;m not actually doing what I was hired to do. No, I&#39;ve been stocking coffee the last three days (not today, because I was off). I guess my training will start on Thursday at roughly 8am. More on that as things develop....</p>
<p>Now for my ranting. Whoo! Lately, my mom has been calling pregnant gals &quot;prego&quot;. &quot;That gal&#39;s prego&quot;, &quot;Oh, is she prego?&quot;. ARRGGHHH! It drives me nuts! Prego is a blasted spaghetti sauce for crying in ship!! Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prego">Wikipedia says so</a>! So the next time you hear somebody disgrace the name of licensed marinara sauce in such a way, do me a favor and say &quot;Yes, that is some fine eatin&#39;!&quot;</p>
</div></article><article><h2>SCREW BLOGGER!!!</h2><time>March 17, 2006</time><div><p>After writing a beautiful, heartfelt post on Blogger and having it lost because it was never able to upload the stupid thing, I am now using Wordpress. It&#39;s completely in house (i.e. on my server) and shouldn&#39;t have any of these inane issues. Now, on to that heartfelt entry :-).</p>
<p>Today, Friday, March 17th marks my official last day as a cashier. Starting at 4am on Saturday I will be an Overstock Manager*. Al I looking forward to it? Yes, yes I am. Not only is the cashier job driving me insane right now, but it&#39;ll be nice ot have my day back again. I plan on using the extra time to start working towards my GED. I hereby solemnly swear that I, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Scott_Hackmann">Matthew Scott Hackmann</a> will obtain my GED before May 1st, 2006. There, it&#39;s in magnetic bits, can&#39;t back out now. It really is something that needs to be done, and Wally World will reimburse me anything I spend on it too :-).</p>
<p>My emulator is coming along quite nicely, though there are more annoying hurdles to get over yet. I can basically say that Mario Bros. and Metroid are completely playable (last I checked). Zelda and Stringer (my two new scrolling test apps) are still buggy (like it&#39;s on the wrong table all the time), but otherwise everything is looking pretty sweet. However, I&#39;m going to hold off for now while I pursue a new project.</p>
<p>My Uncle Dave (hey dude :-D) was nice enough to give me his old Handspring Visor (circa 1999) and that will be my new programming toy. The only thing I really have in mind for it right now is an app to take to bowling to score games and give statistical reports on the fly. Luckily Palm has all their development stuff opened up so that&#39;ll make it much easier.</p>
<p>I can now say I&#39;ve played Doom on my iPod. Last week, while still swept up in the initial &quot;wow! this is cool&quot;-ness of the whole iPod thing, I installed Linux on it and played Doom. However, it was borking up music playback on the Apple side of it so I toasted Linux and have my music playing greatness back. I&#39;m really getting into podcasts, my favorites being <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73329404&amp;s=143441">this WEEK in TECH (TWiT)</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=87819353&amp;s=143441">RevoGaming.net</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=74169891&amp;s=143441">Diggnation</a> (gotta love Kevin Rose). Also, I bought an album full of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=91158108&amp;s=143441">SpongeBob goodness</a> and the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=54796297&amp;s=143441&amp;i=54795627">theme</a> from Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy (for you old timers, the original <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1054520&amp;s=143441&amp;i=1054517">Eagles</a> version).</p>
<p>Well, I believe that&#39;s all I needed to say. Just remember, vote for Pedro and all your wildest dream will come true :-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Moved to Blogger</h2><time>January 18, 2006</time><div><p>Just wanted to let you all know that I&#39;ve moved my blog over to Blogger (I explain why there). So here&#39;s the new address (temporary): <a href="http://dxprog.blogspot.com">http://dxprog.blogspot.com</a>. Once I have my new hosting and old blog posts moved over I&#39;ll have the dxprog.com address back - Matt &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Fun with faces!</h2><time>January 12, 2006</time><div><p>Found a <a href="http://www.myheritage.com/">website</a> that is currently beta testing some facial recognition software. You can upload your face and have it match it against a database full of celebreties. Well, I dumped a picture of me and and apprently I look like Tim Berners-Lee :-D (actually there is a striking resemblene). Now isn&#39;t that cool :-). See ya and have fun.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Tetra updates!</h2><time>January 9, 2006</time><div><p>I was kind of feeling the lack of Tetra&#39;s blog features today so I went in and started piddling around with stuff. As you can see the archives list is now sorted in descending order and I also have a little links bar (I can add as many side bars as I want too :-)). Also, fixed a few problems in the message board code and cleaned up a couple other things that had been bothering me for months.</p>
<p>I got my USBC card today which brings to to the following important note: tomorrow is bowling again. YAY! After that I&#39;ll be working three days and then get Saturday off. YAY! Then I&#39;ll work Sunday and I&#39;ll be off again. YAY! (I &#39;spect that&#39;s getting annoyiing :-P).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all I wanted to say. But before I go I&#39;ll give a shout out to my coworker buddy, Blake! :-D See ya :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>It&#x27;s official... I check people out for a living</h2><time>January 7, 2006</time><div><p>And checking out hot babes is fun ;-). No, really. Yesterday my job code was officially changed to cashier so now, uhh.... it&#39;s official :-P. Today was my first 8 hour day doing cashier and what what a day it was. Standing in one spot and constantly leaning over to reach people&#39;s stuff takes a nasty toll on your back. And when you&#39;ve been waiting 40 minutes for the managers to send you home it&#39;s even worse :-P. But, overall, I quite enjoy the job (a lot of button pushing ;-)). Tomorrow I work six hours and then, hallelujah, I&#39;m off Monday and Tuesday :-D.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672326612/qid=1136691749/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4/103-2137882-6907848?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">3D game programming book</a> came the other and it&#39;s really a good book. It&#39;s actually written by one of the guys on the DirectX dev team so you know it&#39;s at least accurate :-P. But really, if you&#39;re starting out 3d game programming look into this book.</p>
<p>Lastly, last night I ordered up a (legit) copy of Yoshi&#39;s Island GBA so that should be coming some time next week. I look forward to playing that on my lunch breaks :-).</p>
<p>Yes, it seems my life nhas boiled down to two things: work and programming. But, heck, at least I&#39;m malking money (getting a few hundred dollar paycheck every two weeks rocks ;-)). Until next time, keep those prices rollin&#39;!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>So it&#x27;s 2006... I smell no difference</h2><time>January 1, 2006</time><div><p>Ah, the new year has arrived and with it a job change for me. That&#39;s right I achieved my life long dream and got a part time job at the Sizzler! No, really. I am now a cashier at Wal-mart. I originally wanted to be a cart pusher because cashier was something I wanted to be even less. There was a bit of confusion for a while because I told Debbie (schedule lady) I didn&#39;t really like cashiering and I&#39;d rather be a cart pusher. My guess is she misunderstood, got it reversed and set things in motion for me to become a cashier (they even changed my job code to cart pusher so they could change it to cashier which had me even more confused). But tonight was my first night working the register (being watched, of course) and it wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought it&#39;d be. I have tomorrow and Tuesday off so that makes things even sweeter.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tuesday there&#39;s bowling again (thank heavens)! Now that I have a job I appreciate the bowling night even more than I did before. Tomorrow Mom and I are going to go to Tulsa and do some shopping. I&#39;ve got $50+ dollars of spending money ($300 if I borrowed from savings, but that&#39;s college money now). I&#39;m thinking of buying Yoshi&#39;s Island or Mairo World (if I can find it :-P). I&#39;ve even tossed the idea of getting a DS and Mario Kart DS around, but my laptop is cool enough for me at the moment ;-).</p>
<p>But, now that I&#39;ve rambled on long enough, I bid you all a happy new year. 2005 was quite an eventful year for me and 2006 will probably bring some interesting things. Stay here for the latest :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>So sweet, yet so short</h2><time>December 25, 2005</time><div><p>Before I delve into this stuff I just want to say I hope you all had a good Christmas :-).</p>
<p>Well, Christmas paper shredding has come and gone once again. All that excitement and anticipation over with the course of a couple hours. Ah, but a pretty sweet Christmas it was. So, I bet the question on the tip of your tounges is &quot;What&#39;dya get?&quot;. Here&#39;s the run down: glass chess set (frosted even :-D), laptop backpack, CF card reader/writer, a &quot;Pedro&#39;s Got your Back&quot; and a nice flannel shirt, some money and a gift card, a Dave Berry book, and the piece de resitance: my own cell phone :-D. Quite a cool one at that. Basic, but it suits my needs. Actually, truth be told, it does some stuff that my parents fancier phone doesn&#39;t do, namely the ability to use SMS web services (such as google). Quite sweet, quite sweet.</p>
<p>The last few days I&#39;ve been delving into GBA dev again and something seems to have finally clicked. I understand how loading sprites works and all that malarkey and so I&#39;ve begun my GBA Tetris Attack clone. And actually it&#39;s coming along quite nicely. Debugging is a pain in the but since I don&#39;t have a debug console or files to write ciritcal values to, but I&#39;m chugging along all the same.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if I haven&#39;t mentioned already, I go to discuss my future at Wal-Mart (Christmas Eve marked my last day in layaway). I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ll end up exactly, but at this point in time cart pusher seems most likely. Now I know I was complaining earlier, but I&#39;ve done it a couple of times since and I&#39;ll tell you that being able to use the QuickCart makes it a heckuva lot easier. My other option is cashier, but dislike that even more (though if it was back in electronics I might reconsider). I personally wouldn&#39;t mind working in claims or as an overnight stocker (both of which I have done). Whenever there was nothing to do in layaway after closing I&#39;d usually get sent to toys to help them stock and I must say it was a lot of fun (I did chemicals one night and I liked that too). So we&#39;ll just see tomorrow (and I&#39;ll post something about it).</p>
<p>Ah, but now it is getting late and I&#39;ve got presents to play with (maybe I&#39;ll go blow Jeff away in a game of chess). Stay tuned for an interesting video clip from yesterday morning. It&#39;s absolutely hilarious. Cheers!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Christmas is coming</h2><time>December 20, 2005</time><div><p>Twas some days before Christmas and all through the house,
not a creature was stirring except for the dudeon his laptop.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t rhyme, but I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m sitting here in our new living room lit up tree in front of me and a fireplace full of stockings to my right (picture coming soon). Now this in and of itself is a nice feeling but having my laptop and posting here while doing it makes the feeling cooler ;-). But anyhoo...</p>
<p>Christmas <em>is</em> is coming and we&#39;ve been doing all the usual: making cookies, listening to Christmas music (even while I&#39;m at work :-D), buying gifts, etc. I&#39;d say that we&#39;re pretty much ready. The only bad thing is that Dad found the key to the freezer and I must go cookieless until Christmas Eve :-(.</p>
<p>Things in layaway have slowed down considerably. Thursday and Friday were a nightmare but since I couold count on my hands and toes how many people have come through to get stuff. Sunday night I began learning the how to operate the register and I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t want to do that (for reasons I don&#39;t want to go into again :-P). On Monday I&#39;ll be discussing my future at Wal-Mart with a manager and depending on if there&#39;s any other spots open or not I&#39;ll either be a cashier or a cart pusher. If I could do cashiering back in electronics I&#39;d probably leap on it, otherwise I&#39;ll probably push carts (unless overnight socker is available). But anyways, it looks like I&#39;m not even going to get laid off before coming back (I must have made a good impression).</p>
<p>But now I must go and make another attempt at finding the freezer key (or something :-P). Merry Christmas :-D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>LAPTOP!! WHOOOO!!</h2><time>December 15, 2005</time><div><p>Ah.... I sit in the living room in a nice comfy chair as I write this. Yes.. I got my laptop out this morning. I stayed up all night to do it, but I did it and DANGif it isn&#39;t a darn nice feeling :-). I&#39;ve got a bunch of junk I&#39;m going to need to uninstall (currently there are 14 icons down on the system tray :-P). But at least I&#39;ve got a processor/RAM combo that can handle a bunch of stuff :-D.</p>
<p>This is a bittersweet feeling, though, because today is the day that all Christmas layaway&#39;s are due out. It&#39;s probably going to be a hellacious afternoon/evening but at least I&#39;ll have something nice to come to tonight :-). That said, though, it may not be so bad because we&#39;ve got an orderly system in place. From what I understand I&#39;ll come in, pick up a car with somebody&#39;s layaway, get it and bring it in. That is a far cry from going to to get 5+ layaway&#39;s at a time :-P.</p>
<p>But, now I must fiddle with junk. BABEE! :-D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Cart Pushing SUCKS!!!</h2><time>December 6, 2005</time><div><p>Yeah, that&#39;s right. It isn&#39;t in my nature to swear, but I hate cart pushing. The last two nights layaway has been dead enough that they&#39;ve sent me out to push carts in the parking lot. I pushed carts in freezing weather for one and a half hours without a hat or gloves on Sunday and for an hour yesterday. Luckily I was smart enough to bring the hat and gloves then. I tell you though, if Wal-Mart calls me back in January and says they want me to be a cart pusher I will turn it down. There is no way in heck I would do that as my main job. There, now it&#39;s out :-P.</p>
<p>On the upside I&#39;ve got only $380 to go on my laptop. I&#39;ll get it out one week from Thursday. It seems like an eternity away, though. But, I&#39;ve been waiting years I think I can wait one more week. I think...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Return of the mad eBayer!</h2><time>November 29, 2005</time><div><p>Yes, it is I, insane Matt posting inane items on eBay! For those of you who don&#39;t know I am the creator of such infamous items as the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/cc.html">&quot;Common Cold&quot;</a> and the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/dv_pancake.jpg">&quot;Darth Vader Pancake&quot;</a>. However, this eBay auction is a little more sane... just a little. At the very least I&#39;m selling more or less a legitimate item... an e-mail address. That&#39;s right, loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com (yes, I actually managed to snag that address). I&#39;m hoping there are plenty of Zelda fans out there who&#39;d like this address and after an Xbox 360 gmail addy went for $570 how can I lose. It&#39;ll only be a quarter if I do :-P. But, anyways...</p>
<p>Thursday is pay day again. I&#39;ve made up a spreadsheet to keep track of my hours and take out all the proper taxes and according to that this paycheck will be about $316.60 (54 hours worked). I&#39;ve also calculated my current schedule through to the 15th and I&#39;ll have just enough to pull out my laptop! YAY! :-D</p>
<p>Later :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Xbox 360 is here...</h2><time>November 22, 2005</time><div><p>Because I work at Wal-Mart now I get to witness all sorts of interesting things: people putting peanuts (yes, the food) on layaway, burly guys throwing canning jars all over the place, etc. etc. But yesterday was probably the most interesting, if not incredibly stupid, thing I&#39;ve seen yet: people waiting hours and hours to get their hands on a freakin&#39; game system. Not only that but they would pull pillows and blankets off the shelves to lay on... and then we gave them free soda and cookies! But anyways, I was also able to see the supply before just about anybody else in the store (working so near the security cage ihas it&#39;s nice points ;-)).</p>
<p>Ah, but anyways. I did get my paycheck on Thursday. Because it only counted towards a week and a half it was $190 as opposed to the post-$200 figures I was figuring. But now I&#39;m going to be working close to 35-39 hours a week so that number should be close to doubling by next payday.</p>
<p>I also got my extra 10% Christmas discount with that paycheck. Stinky thing is it had to be used before December 4th. So I went ahead and stuffed my laptop on layaway. It has to be out by the 15th (though I may be able to get that changed) but I think that since I&#39;m working the longer hours I will be able to pay the thing off and maybe even have a little extra left.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I should wrap this up. I hope everybody out there has a good Thanksgiving! :-D</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Another reason to hate cats</h2><time>November 16, 2005</time><div><p>Now it may be a fairly unkown fact about me, but I can&#39;t stand cats. Mainly, if for any reason, it is because at our old house there were cats that made a permanent residence there. And when the males went around marking their territory, it wasn&#39;t pretty.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I have another reason to hate cats: It seems I&#39;m allergic to them. Yesterday I went to an allergist to see what the heck I&#39;m allergic to because I have nasty allergies at certain times of the year (and I&#39;ve got asthma so we were there for that too). Well, I went in and they poked my back with all sorts of pollens and stuff. It appears I&#39;m not allergic to anything organic (as in trees and such), just cats and dust mites (apparently I got a huge welt from the dust mite test). They also put me through a treadmill test to test my lung function and I got another surprise there. I&#39;m not asthmatic enough to even be labelled with having activity enduced asthma. So I&#39;m testing that by laying off my inhaler whilst being active and seeing what gives. I made it through bowling last night without a problem. Tomorrow when I go to work I won&#39;t &quot;deasthmaize&quot; and see how I do there.</p>
<p>Speaking of tomorrow it&#39;s my first payday (yay!). It&#39;s driving me insane to see how much I&#39;ve made in the last two weeks. I&#39;ll probably have a picture of me and my check stub up for you people :-)</p>
<p>In the land of NES development I&#39;ve gotten two opcodes interpreted but now I&#39;m stuck on something else: it seems I&#39;m not interpreting the ROM data right. I&#39;ve run my test ROM through a couple of disassemblers and they&#39;re reading the first four bytes in as something else (actually, the two disassemblers had different results. Go figure :-P). I&#39;ll have to do more research to figure this out. In the mean time you can read a blow-by-blow run-down of development <a href="http://www.youngprogrammers.net/index.php/CoolNES">here</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>One Week Anniversary</h2><time>November 11, 2005</time><div><p>As of today (or yesterday now :-P) I&#39;ve been working at Wal-mart for one week. I&#39;ve done probably about everything, now, and seen just about everything put on layaway (except groceries). I&#39;m not sure what my standing is now, but I was already getting high praise on Monday (can&#39;t let it get to my head). Also, yesterday, the other layaway boy had his first day and I showed him the ropes. He&#39;ll be mainly working when I&#39;m not. Just some interesting stats that I&#39;ll be updating regularly. To date I&#39;ve boxed/binned the following:
4 GameCubes
1 GameBoy Advance SP
2 Xboxs
2 PlayStation 2s
1 Laptop</p>
<p>Quite fun, eh? Also, at the request of SeniorUSB, here is a picture of me in my &quot;little vest&quot;:
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/matt_money_man.jpg" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>One day after work I went to the electronics dept. to take a look at their laptops because apparently I&#39;ll get an extra 10% cupon for Christmas bonus. I didn&#39;t really expect to find anything aside from budget systems, but I found <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4228534">this</a>. With the exception of hard drive space it is more powerful than my desktop (which will become a file/web server). A feature I thought was kind of interesting was the fact that it can play DVD/CDs without even booting into Windows (save on battery life I&#39;m sure). But it will be nice to have a portable computing solution, not to mention just downright cool :-).</p>
<p>In programming land, I&#39;m currently working on trying to write an NES emulator. This is pretty much just for the learning experience to help understand the behind the scene ops of computers/game consoles. I hope that by learning that stuff I&#39;ll have a better understanding of current systems (GBA, GCN, etc.) and thus develop for them with little or no learning curve. I&#39;ve found a bunch of handy info at <a href="http://parodius.nesdev.com">NesDev.com</a> which is helping quite a bit and I more or less understand how the whole internal system works, but figuring how you load things in from ROM sill escapes me. Hopefully this time next week I&#39;ll have my mock 6502 running a few opcodes. I&#39;m mainly trying to get the thing to the point that I can run the original Mario Bros. which is fairly basic but it&#39;ll be a mighty cool feeling, I&#39;ll tell you now :-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My First Day</h2><time>November 4, 2005</time><div><p>Well, I made it through my first day working in Lawaway. Overall I think it went pretty well (except all the women&#39;s underwear I had to handle :-P). However, it&#39;ll be nice when I can go in there and know what to do instead of hanging around more seasoned coworkers and have them coach me through everything. </p>
<p>I just did the math and my first paycheck should be about $326.20. Figuring I get about that much every week (and those are only 25 hour work weeks, mind you) by the time Christmas is over I&#39;ll have around $1300! Enough to by myself that laptop :-D</p>
<p>In non-job related news, my Episode III DVD arrived today. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said it already, but I got it completely free all because I took a survey :-D. It doesn&#39;t get much sweeter than that. I&#39;ll probably watch it tonight and watch all the extras over the next few days. Ought to be a nice break from work :-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Windows 2003 Troubles</h2><time>October 30, 2005</time><div><p>Well, yesterday was a great day... NOT! Somehow, and I&#39;ve yet been able to figure out why, my password got reset. Now I figure it&#39;s one of four scenerios:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> A little kid somehow changed the password by pounding on my keyboard
<strong>B)</strong> One of our neighbors has been sitting cracking our WPA passkey the last month (and I think that all of our neighbors have WiFi)
<strong>C)</strong> Some Uber h4x0r who&#39;s peed off at me snuck in via the internet and changed it hoping to make my life miserable
<strong>D)</strong> My SAM file got corrupted</p>
<p>D is the most likely scenerio, but you can&#39;t discount any of the others. Anyhoo, I spent most of yesterday figuring out how to undo it without reinstalling Windows. My first thought was to try the Linux distro <a href="http://cyti.latgola.lv/ruuni/index_en.html">austrumi</a> which has a utility called nt_pass (only in version 0.9.2, btw). Well, that didn&#39;t want to work because, gosh, my SAM file is read-only. Well what jerk wrote <em>that</em> program? :-P</p>
<p>So, I went and did some more searching and came across a little hole in the Windows Istaller. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> You&#39;ll need a Windows XP/2003 CD (any flavor: plain, SP1 or SP2) that&#39;s bootable (I &#39;spect most have this kind)
<strong>B)</strong> Boot with that and get to the point where you can repair a Windows install (Enter, Enter, F8, R I believe is the key sequence)
<strong>C)</strong> Just go along with that. Your computer will reboot and start the second half of the install.
<strong>D)</strong> Be paying atention to the progress bar in the lower left of the screen. When I says &quot;Install Devices&quot; hit F10. You&#39;ll be greeted by a command prompt which will allow you to do darn near anything you want.
<strong>E)</strong> In this particular case run the command &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; and a friendly box will come up where you can reset passwords, add users, etc.
<strong>F)</strong> Once you&#39;ve done whatever it is you&#39;re going to do let Windows finish installing or you&#39;ll lose everything you just did.</p>
<p>Needless to say that I created myself a new user account so I could leave the Aministrator one alone (&#39;tis one of the drawbacks to 2K3. You have to go using the command prompt just to get to a place to add a user :-P). But now I&#39;m back in business and everything works great. I hope somebody out there finds that useful because it sure was to me.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>dxprog the wage slave</h2><time>October 27, 2005</time><div><p>Well, I made it past my interview (I&#39;d like to say with flying colors). I may as well say I&#39;ve got a job (I have no doubt in my mind that I&#39;ll pass the drug/alcohol test). In fact, before taking the test today (yuck) I overheard the people in the back talking about how I was &quot;the only one today&quot; and that Wal-mart hasn&#39;t been &quot;getting any applications&quot;. They&#39;re deperate. They need me.</p>
<p>No updates on Ramboella as I can&#39;t find my darn Office CD key back (had it just last week :-P). I may mooch off my parents copy of 2K3 Pro (it is nicer) but I&#39;m going to have to do something and soon if I&#39;m going to be on the job 5+ hours a day.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Update from progland</h2><time>October 25, 2005</time><div><p>Ah, well it seems I have stuff to talk about again. First of all I&#39;ve got an idea for a simple short film which I will probably be filming as soon as I finish the script. But until I can get a trailer up, you&#39;ll have to live with this poster:
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/ramboella.jpg" alt="" title="image">
I should be able to finish the script this week and start shooting next week. So keep coming back for updates.</p>
<p>Also, and this is the big news, but it looks like I may have a job pretty soon (as in an actual job). Last night I applied at Wal-Mart and I&#39;m already setup for an interview tomorrow. Now for the moment I may just have a temp job for the holidays (in the lawaway dept. of course :-P), but if I do my job well enough and with enough SpongeBob-like enthusiasm I probably have a chance of becoming a normal employee. We&#39;ll see, though. The good thing is is that I&#39;ll be making my own money pretty soon (can you spell laptop? :-D).</p>
<p>Well, it was nice to have something to post for a change (and good news at that). Just remember to keep your RSS reader up-to-date or check back for more information on... Ramboella!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>I isn&#x27;t dead!</h2><time>October 15, 2005</time><div><p>And I isn&#39;t ejucaded either :-P. Not much new going on over here. I&#39;m still doing the Clear Creek site (sparked an idea for an ASP.NET wiki :-D). Also, did a bunch of work for the Schindler&#39;s again. Made a profitable $50 off of it which I&#39;ve promptly used to buy myself a 120GB hard drive. Oh, and I got a free $20 Amazon.com gift certificate for taking a [<a href="http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link">http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link</a>] survey. I&#39;ll probably buy Episode III with that (totally free :-D).</p>
<p>Jeff bought Jedi Academy last week. Awesome, awesome game that one is. Never thought I could get into an FPS, but I did. It&#39;s $10 software so if you see it I recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>That seems to be all. I know, short entry for such a long reprieve. Until next time :-P</p>
</div></article><article><h2>All moved in</h2><time>September 28, 2005</time><div><p>Well, after a hellish last week we are all moved into our new house (when I say &quot;all moved in&quot; that means we live here, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean we&#39;re all unpacked :-P). It&#39;s wonderful. Our room is almost double the size of what we had and the backyard is superb (we&#39;ve been out at least twice everyday since we moved last Wednesday). Of course, there&#39;s been a few problems but all have now been worked out.</p>
<p>Last night I e-mail Phil Vischer, creator of the popular kids show VeggieTales, inquiring about how he rigged the veggies. To my surprise, waiting in my inbox this afternoon was a personal reply:
[quote]Hey Matt,</p>
<p>When we produced the shows in Softimage, it was all lattice  deformation.  Each eye was in a lattice, and then the entire  character was in a lattice.  We just animated lattices.  The mouths  were simple texture maps created by a separate animation and applied  in rendering, and then reapplied slightly blurred as a bump map.   Very simple stuff.  (All developed in 1991 when I built Larry for the  first time.)</p>
<p>Virtually nothing changed until we moved to Maya in 2000.  By then I  was no longer animating, so I&#39;m not sure what they changed.  Now  everything is done in Canada, and I&#39;m clueless.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Phil[/quote]
Talk about cool :-D. With that knowledge I can now finish my models for MeatStories (R) ;-).</p>
<p>Also this afternoon I became the webmaster for a bunch of <a href="http://www.clearcreekmonks.org">monks</a>. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to call their &quot;outside guy&quot; to get a list of everything I need to do. I poked around their server a bit and it looks like I&#39;m going to have to do some ASP[.NET] work (which I&#39;d actually been tinkering with shortly before we moved), so that&#39;ll be fun (and bring back some memories).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for tonight. Now that my computer is setup again (with internet) I&#39;ll be making my usual every other day entry.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Prepare for a Revolution!</h2><time>September 19, 2005</time><div><p>It was certainly an exciting weekend for those of us paying attention to TGS (Tokyo Game Show). The new Nintendo Revolution controller was finally unveiled. At first I was kind of skeptical, I mean the thing is a freakin&#39; remote:
<img src="http://cubemedia.ign.com/cube/image/article/651/651275/hands-on-the-revolution-controller-20050915054852879-000.jpg" alt="" title="image">
Part of me kind of died because I&#39;ve grown up holding a controller in two hands using super quick thumb reflexes to get myself around. However, the more I thought about the possibilities of the tilt sensors, the more I began to like it. One thing that I would love to see is a Star Wars lightsaber game. I was still kind of leery, but then I heard that there&#39;s a conventional controller that you can plug the remote into. Besides, I&#39;ll be able to play Tetris Attack, so I have to buy one whether I like the controller or note. Needless to say I really can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one of these and see how it works.</p>
<p>On the house front: A good 75-80% of the house is packed now. Mainly just the big things (furniture, appliances, computers, etc.) are left. Sometime tomorrow we&#39;ll be getting a dumpster and emptying the garage and packing the U-Haul. It&#39;s going to be a long, tiring week but it&#39;ll be well worth it.</p>
<p>As an interesting closer I post some things I&#39;ve unearthed (either through packing or cleaning up my computer):

<p>And finally: <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/flash/jj.html">Jack and Jill (flash)</a></p>
</div></article><article><h2>Pictures! Yay!</h2><time>September 15, 2005</time><div><p>We went through our grand tour of the house today (second for me) and I was able to snap some pictures. So, here they are:</p>
<p>[gallery=The New House]<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/STAIRS.jpg" alt="" title="The Stairway"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/LIVING1.jpg" alt="" title="The living room..."><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/LIVING2.jpg" alt="" title="...and again from a different angle"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/DININGROOM.jpg" alt="" title="The dining room"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/OFFICE.jpg" alt="" title="The office (sadly, it&#39;s not my desk :-():"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/OURROOM1.jpg" alt="" title="Our room (Jeff, Chris and I)"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/GIRLSROOM.jpg" alt="" title="The girls&#39; room (that&#39;s Jeff&#39;s butt and Becky, twin #2, in front of the window)"><img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/BATHROOM.jpg" alt="" title="The kids, and my, bathroom">[/gallery]</p>
<p>I seem to be missing pictures of the master bedroom as well as Steve and Joe&#39;s room, but that&#39;s the gist of it. </p>
<p>Most of our stuff (and when I say our I&#39;m usually refferring to Jeff, Chris and myself since we are roomies) is all packed and ready to go.</p>
<p>Well, we&#39;re getting down to the wire on this but it looks like we&#39;re gonna make it! Part of me is kind of sad that we&#39;re going to leave this house (I mean, I&#39;ve lived here 18 out of 19 years of my life), but it&#39;ll be nice to move on.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The moving begins!</h2><time>September 14, 2005</time><div><p>Our realtor called today and apparently we should&#39;ve been packing a week ago because now we&#39;re left with exactly one week to pack! So, I&#39;ve been going through my stuff today (nuked a few CDs :-D) and getting ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first night of bowling and a good night of bowling it was. The first two games were sort of ehhhh, but the last game was my best yet. I&#39;ll let the image speak for itself (haven&#39;t tested this Tetra feature, so it&#39;s overdue ;-)):
<img src="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/bowling.png" alt="" title="image">
Yeah, 207! My dad was only 18 ahead of me at 225 (I beat him the first game :-D). If this had been last year I would&#39;ve gotten my 100 pins over average watch. Pooh :-P. </p>
<p>Well, with the moving and all, it may be a while until I can put anything up. I&#39;ll try to squeak out a little blurb before I have to pack my computer. Cheers :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>&quot;Yes&quot; is their final answer</h2><time>September 6, 2005</time><div><p>It seems like the biggest problem to us getting out of our house is no problem. The people who are buying our house have basically set everything in stone and so now our house and the house we&#39;re getting will all have &quot;Sold&quot; signs. So now the packing begins (our room&#39;ll be a nightmare :-P) and in probably about two weeks we&#39;ll be in our house :-D. btw, here&#39;s some info on our <a href="http://remax.realtor.com/Prop/1048630457?lnksrc=00045&amp;gate=remax">new house</a>.</p>
<p>A couple days ago I picked up my free version of <a href="http://www.linspire.com">Linspire</a> and I decided to try to move over to Linux full time for a month. I got it installed and it was certainly nice looking. I went through some trouble figuring out how to use apt packages but I started to get the hang of things. And then the trouble set in. PHP was giving me problems with MySQL, depending on what program I tried I couldn&#39;t get the sound working/synced on DVDs (or avis) and Lsongs, while nice, obviously was running on a low priority because it would cut out frequently. And things went down from there. So, I&#39;m back on a fresh install of Win2K3 and it&#39;s nice to be home.</p>
<p>Got an interesting piece of mail the other day about a college down in Florida called FullSail that specializes in film [pre/post]-production. It&#39;s quite interesting because next to game programming the realm of film is my other big area of fascination. So whether I&#39;m going to DigiPen or this place is kind of a toss up. I guess I&#39;ll worry about that when I get there. Right now I have to keep studying for ye olde GED and get a job (so I can buy my laptop ;-)).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for today. Stay tuned.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Crunch time!</h2><time>September 2, 2005</time><div><p>Well, we&#39;ve had an offer, the papers are signed and with any luck the moving will commence soon. So for those of you out there who pray please add in an extra word to the man upstairs that all this goes through :-).</p>
<p>Bowling league starts again in a couple weeks (13th) which I am looking forward to. Dad and I had been on a Monday league over the summer, but it was with &quot;commoners&quot; (i.e. people who come and bowl every now and again) and the atmosphere was.... common :-P. Now we&#39;ll be in a USBCC sanctioned league again with all our bowling buddies from last year :-D.</p>
<p>I will be updating in as much as I can. Stay tuned. Now back to our regularly scheduled program...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>General Update</h2><time>August 30, 2005</time><div><p>It&#39;s been a few days since I last posted anything. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all thinking because we&#39;re moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).</p>
<p>But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It&#39;s not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.</p>
<p>Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I&#39;m in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game <a href="http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test">here.</a></p>
<p>I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I&#39;m not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let&#39;s face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I&#39;m sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you&#39;re interested in helping check out the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The ship is about to hit the fan</h2><time>August 24, 2005</time><div><p>Got a call this morning from our realtor. The showing last night went incredibly well, apparently. So well, in fact, that the guy is going to be getting his financing in order within the next day or so. So that means I will be <strong>movingprog!!</strong></p>
<p>In other news, Steve&#39;s Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It&#39;ll be nice to have something to play again.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Ahhh... programming</h2><time>August 22, 2005</time><div><p>I&#39;ve managed to land myself on a project that combines my two loves: games and web. Tryblithe, owner of <a href="http://www.ctsquare.net">CT Square</a> web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it&#39;s all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it&#39;s much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that&#39;s pretty cool :-)</p>
<p>Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that&#39;s about all there is to report there.</p>
<p>Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That&#39;s right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought &quot;Hey, this looks kind of cool&quot;. But I&#39;ve been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is &quot;We&#39;re coming soon!&quot;, &quot;Almost there...&quot;, &quot;blah blah blah...&quot;. One of their so called &quot;storez&quot; was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here&#39;s is Amazon&#39;s reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:</p>
<p>[quote]&quot;At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
web site.  </p>
<p>Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
their site.&quot;[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, real legit :-P.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)</p>

</div></article><article><h2>Title goes here (best I could do :-P)</h2><time>August 16, 2005</time><div><p>Some interesting things happened today (we had burgers for supper, that in itself makes it interesting ;-)).</p>
<p>Firstly, my Empire game is coming along nicely. I spent most of the afternoon and part of this evening getting the random map generation working. That was a blast :-D. Tomorrow I will actually start building the engine framework. This is the part where I generally choke, but I feel pretty motivated :-). I&#39;ve never really done anything to this degree (and this clean) in C++.</p>
<p>Secondly, I got to evict a wasp nest hanging up in one of the windows. It was kind of cool (and scary). Luckily, we&#39;ve got some nasty spray that kills on contact. A couple of spritzes upwards and it started raining wasps. One tried to retaliate, but then it died ;-).</p>
<p>Thirdly, somebody is coming to see the house tomorrow morning (day 6 on the market, about day 4 for actually having the sign up). So that means more cleaning and evacuation and since school starts locally tomorrow we&#39;re going to be the odd ones out. Figures :-P. But, all in all, I don&#39;t really mind. The more people who look at the house the greater our odds of selling the thing.</p>
<p>It kind of bums me out that Twilight Princess isn&#39;t coming out until next year, but that gives me more time to come up with money ;-). Actually, I seem to have found a direction for me to go. Sometime this year I&#39;ll take the GED and then just spend from then until fall of next year, when I&#39;ll go to a local college to get ready for DigiPen, on a job and saving money. It&#39;s the clearest direction on where to take life I&#39;ve had in a long time.</p>
<p>Well, that was kind of long winded for a change :-P. Before I leave, however, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to Slazer for reading my blog. You&#39;re a cool dude, Slazer ;-). See ya!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Tetra a thing of the past?</h2><time>August 15, 2005</time><div><p>Yeah, seems like a crazy proposition considering how much time and effort I&#39;ve stuffed into it, but I may be moving on to something new. I&#39;ve been seeing a lot about Ajax, some fancy JScript/XML stuff that basically eliminates page loading, and I may take a shot at basing my new engine around this. Of course, it&#39;s just an idea at the moment.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;ve been starting a new game. It&#39;ll basically be a Windows version of the old strategy game, Empire. I&#39;ve been messing around with D3D8 the last couple days and I finally got all the rendering stuff done this morning (yay!).</p>
<p>In the land of house-stuffs, somebody else is coming to see the place tomorrow. We don&#39;t know the details because Dad couldn&#39;t catch much of the call (due to noisy little kids). Something about they&#39;ll call again, they&#39;re from California, blah blah blah. So we&#39;ll have to vacate again, but if it means we get that house we&#39;ve bid on, who cares :-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>New house?</h2><time>August 12, 2005</time><div><p>The parents have signed the papers for our new house and to get our current one slapped on the market. Today, day one of house-on-the-market-dom, an investor came by to look at the place. As I write this we have no idea what his thoughts are, but the fact that it&#39;s only been a day is promising.</p>
<p>In programming land I downloaded every pattern from ACC and am having fun fiddling with that data. First I converted it all into pattern data (a string 1024 bytes long using hex numbers for image data) and yesterday a wrote a little compression algorithm. It&#39;s similar to BMPs RLE compression and just about halved the size of the file. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll do with the stuff now. I may lump it all into a database and build a viewer around it (it would be nice if the guy who ran ACC liked it and hired me to write the ASP version).</p>
<p>Well, we&#39;re going to be eating lunch so that&#39;s all I&#39;ll write for today. Heck, maybe the next entry will be written from our new house (would be nice). Cheers :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Erg</h2><time>August 6, 2005</time><div><p>Well, I got my games today (after an eternity of waiting) and surprise, surprise they&#39;re pirated copies :-@. I&#39;m hoping I can get a refund and if I can&#39;t get that I hope at least that these games won&#39;t fritz on me immediatly. But, my ALttP cart (which I learned is also pirated) hasn&#39;t gone nutzy on me yet, so maybe if I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ll still be playing these when I&#39;m 50 :-P.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve finished with my changes to the <a href="http://www.parishofstpeter.net">parish site</a>. I had a fun journey into RSS land and the nightmares of PHP&#39;s XML handling came back to haunt me as well :-P. I also decided to put up scanned copies of the bulletin due to the format changes it undergoes each week. It makes me look like a hypocrite because a couple weeks ago the guy who runs the Our Lady of Guadelupe site was on my case for not getting the bulletin up-to-date and was talking about how he just scanned theirs in. I stupidly answered &quot;Nah, that&#39;s cheating. I couldn&#39;t do that.&quot; Well, I did it. However, in my defense, I have a high quality, lossless scan whereas his, well, <a href="http://www.ourladyofguadalupe-dewey.org/bulletin.htm">you make the call</a>.</p>
<p>This afternoon mom and I are going to look at houses (my opinion is highly valued ;-)). With any luck we&#39;ll find something spacious enough for us at a decent price. Maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll post on how all that went, but until then...</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The Canon to Real Life</h2><time>July 27, 2005</time><div><p>It seems I may be launched from my protective shelter at home with my family right into &quot;real&quot; life soon (what is &quot;real&quot;? ;-)). I&#39;m currently being considered for a job at Gamespot/TV.com/MP3.com doing web work for them. Now that in itself is cool but it would mean relocating to San Fransico (a good several hundred miles from here). It&#39;s kind of an exciting thought, though. Finally making my own money, putting aside worries of my future at least for the time being.</p>
<p>In other news, I&#39;m getting the parish site up to speed again (basically the last job that really needs to be done) and I&#39;m going to rewrite my GBA bowling program. I&#39;ve been trying to think of a game to write, but it hasn&#39;t been coming lately. Oh well.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been having some nasty hankering to play old Mario World again (probably thanks to my last write up). So, after collecting some money from VB.NET, I bought it for my beloved GBA :-). Of course, you can&#39;t have Mario World 1 without Mario World 2 (aka Yoshi&#39;s Island) so I got it too :-). Now my game collection should be complete (though Mario Kart would be fun and the Wario Ware games look like a blast :-D).</p>
<p>And, this just in, we finally found a AC adapter for the old keyboard and now I can start teaching myself how to play :-).</p>
<p>Well, I shall sign off for the night. Maybe next time I&#39;ll put up my next autobiographical installment.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>History of Me - Part 2</h2><time>July 17, 2005</time><div><p>Just a quick low-down before I launch into more Matt lore. We&#39;ve started ripping up carpet in the house and using the hardwood floors underneath. I&#39;ve also decided that I&#39;ll be writing a platform game as my next project.</p>
<p>But without further ado, here&#39;s what you&#39;ve been waiting for!</p>
<p>My First Love: Nintendo</p>
<p>Ah, the Nintendo. Such a wondrous machine that could send one on fantastic adventures. My first encounter with the magical gray box was in the early &#39;90s. I believe that one day Dad just showed up with an NES (rental). He got it all hooked up and slapped in Mario 3. My world was forever changed. I don&#39;t remember exactly how old I was at the time, but I&#39;m thinking probably four or five. After the first encounter we would every so often jaunter down to Popingo (long since out of business) and rent a machine and good ol&#39; Mario 3. Now in my mind this was a good as it got. I don&#39;t think I ever really thought of owning one (maybe in my dreams), so it was a complete surprise when that day came:</p>
<p>It was a usual day; I was waiting for mom to pick me up from school (yeah, I went to school at one time). She pulled up and I plopped myself in the backseat and next to me was a box and inside that box was an NES. My first thought was &quot;Whoohoo! Another weekend of fun!&quot; until Mom said &quot;It&#39;s ours&quot;. My Uncle Dan had mailed us his old machine and game collection. I believe the games we had were: Top Gun, Spy Hunter, Mario &amp; Duck Hunt. About a year later he also sent us Paperboy (which had apparently been sitting in his car). Needless to say I was probably bouncing off the walls with joy. The next big thing was the day that Dad rented the original Zelda (though to this day he denies that he&#39;s the one who picked it out). So that was that: I was a Nintendo Fanboy for life.</p>
<p>Over the years we expanded our game collection. We eventually bought Mario 3 which has an interesting story behind it. Apparently some guy bought it thinking it was an SNES games. Of course it wasn&#39;t so he took it to some video rental store (name escapes me) and they sold it dirt cheap. We also picked up some other games like Star Trek and Gauntlet II. </p>
<p>But after a while the same old games are, well, the same old games (though I still enjoy Mario 3 to this day). So I started pining away for the new kid on the block (which was about four years old at that point :-P): the SNES. Whenever we&#39;d go to a store, if they had an SNES set up I&#39;d be there playing it. At one point I actually had enough money to buy one... and then it went off sale. I was pretty ticked. My Uncle Dan was down and I know I tried to get him to give me enough money to buy the thing. <WARNING>DEEP DARK REVEALED HERE</WARNING>I even went so far as to write a priest friend of mine saying more or less:</p>
<p>&quot;I broke a lamp and my mom wants me to replace it but won&#39;t let me do any kind of fund raising and I don&#39;t have any money. Could you lend me $50?&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, lying to a preist. Reeaaall smart :-P. Needless to say I didn&#39;t get a reply. I saw him a few years after I wrote that letter and I was afraid he&#39;d mention it. Maybe he didn&#39;t see it, maybe he forgot about it, maybe he realized that I was a stupid little kid then because he never mentioned it.</p>
<p>But anyways, I believe it was that Christmas of that year, 1996, that my dream finally came true. I remember it like it was yesterday:</p>
<ul>
<li>rip rip rip *
Me: (hold SimCity in hand) Why did we get an SNES game if we don&#39;t have an SNES?
My thought process at that moment was: Well, maybe some games work in both NES and SNES. I was trying not to be too hopeful.
Chris, a couple feet from me, was taking the paper off the machine. Well, screw that thought.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was a pretty magical time. Probably the high point of my gaming experience. Not too long after Christmas we, Jeff, Chris, and I, were going to buy Yoshi&#39;s Island. I could have afforded it myself but, as happened earlier, it went off sale. But at the last minute Chris backed out to pursue his own whims and we couldn&#39;t afford it anymore. So I opted for Zelda: A Link to the Past instead. All I had to do was borrow a dollar from Jeff to make ends meet on that one. It was probably one of the best games I ever bought. It took me over a year to make it through that game (recently I beat it in about a week :-P).</p>
<p>There&#39;s a tale that I have to tell and not sure where it fits in chronologically, so I&#39;ll tell it here. I was pals with an older dude (I call him a dude because he was one) called Dick. I knew him mainly through the Knights of Columbus breakfasts. A side story: I remember one time when he came to school to drill my class on math facts. Everybody was appalled that I called him Dick &quot;<em>gasp</em> You&#39;re supposed to call him Mr. Kamp!&quot;. He never had a problem that I called him, in fact, I think he got a kick out of it. But anyways, he would often bet me that I couldn&#39;t do something (and I usually couldn&#39;t). So one day he said &quot;If you can make it through Link&#39;s Awakening I&#39;ll take you out to eat if you don&#39;t you&#39;ll buy me breakfast.&quot; Well, I nought him breakfast. But along with Zelda he also lent us Final Fantasy III and Donkey Kong Country (yeah, he was a dude ;-)). The next time I saw him I bet that he couldn&#39;t make it through <em>my</em> Zelda game (same deal, go out to eat or buy breakfast). Well he didn&#39;t make it through so one afternoon we went to Murphy&#39;s. That was probably one of the best afternoons of my life. I was glad that we did that before he passed away.</p>
<p>Somewhere in our SNES the N64 was released. I remember well playing Mario 64 at Wal-Mart and being absolutley blown away by it. 3D games were something I had never really thought about so this was something totally new to me. As with the SNES I would play any N64 I came accross. But it was never to be that we&#39;d own one and thus I entered the Dark Times.</p>
<p>We had the Dell by that time and I was starting to get a sense of the vastness of the Internet and somewhere in there I discovered ROMs and emulators. I believe it was on a Zelda site that I first discovered them. So I got to thinking: If they have these <em>ROMs</em> of Zelda perhaps they have them for other games. Yeah... they did. I believe the next thing I got was Final Fantasy III. It went around like this for a little bit until one day I went looking for N64 ROMs. I found them and being on dial-up at the time was appalled at the size. Mario 64 I was able to get in one run when Mom and Dad were out and Zelda 64 I downloaded over the course of several 20 miute spurts when Mom would take Dad back to work (see the trend here?). But I didn&#39;t stop there, I also got Star Fox 64 and Mario Kart 64. I was a crazy little copyright infringer. Then came the big hard drive wipe (my fault :-P). I never really delved into emulation quite as much again.</p>
<p>Christmas 2001 was the next major step and probably the most shocking of all the Christmases: Jeff, Chris, and I all got our own Gameboy Colors (mine was purple ;-)). I couldn&#39;t believe that that was actually happening. It started with Chris opening his and I thought &quot;Lucky butt&quot;. Then Jeff opened his and I was more like &quot;Oh.. my.. GOSH!!&quot;. We quickly forgot about the fact that the SNES had been put up forever becuase now we had portables! Chris went on to own every GBC Zelda game there was (and they are good, good games too). We have such a large number of GBC games it almost rediculous. This came, hilariously, around my decline in the video game immersion. Out of the 15-20 GB games we owned, I had two.</p>
<p>We were happy for a year or more until all the good old SNES games started coming out for GBA (Mario 3, Yoshi&#39;s Island, etc.). That&#39;s when we started yearning for more (greedy little brats we are, eh? ;-)). One day last year I just upped and said &quot;I&#39;m buying a GBA whether you like it or not!&quot; and mom said &quot;OK&quot;. Well, that opened the door and everybody got GBAs (curse them, why can&#39;t <em>I</em> be on top? ;-)). Well, actually, that&#39;s a stupid question there because I do own the brunt of the GBA games now: Zelda: Link to the Past, Mario 3, Minish Cap, an eReader. Sometime this year, and I really couldn&#39;t tell you why, I decided I&#39;d rather have an SP. So I used some of the money I got from felling trees to upgrade and I am really happy now that I did. Heck, even mom likes the thing :-P. It&#39;s the perfect portable: small, foldable, very sleek. I have a media player for it and so it&#39;s also my &quot;iPod&quot;. My ultimate goal is to have all the games that I played as a kid on the SNES for my GBA and then I think I can stop there (Jeff and Chris went on to get DSes, I&#39;m pretty happy where I am).</p>
<p>Now that the GBA stuff is out of the way there&#39;s only one last thing to cover: Gamecube. 2003 came and we had been console-less for a few years. The Gamecube was the new trinket so I made it my goal that Christmas to make sure I could squeak in a little Gamecube plug to the parents. I never actually expected it to work, but apparently it did. I was shocked to say the least. It&#39;s been fun to be riding the edge for a change and the games for GC are awesome. Mario Sunshine is every bit as fun as Mario 64, Wind Waker just rocks the house as does Super Smash Bros Melee and I&#39;ll be looking forward to playing Twilight Princess this fall.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Our journey towards Nintendodom got off to a rocky start but we&#39;re certainly in the thick of things now. And one thing I forgot to mention: It was probably Nintendo that sparked my intrest in becoming a game programmer (as you can well see it certainly played an integral part of my childhood). Looking towars the future I plan on owning a Revolution if not just to have all those wonderful NES, SNES and N64 games at my fingertips. That&#39;s all for this entry, tune in next time for: Memiors of a Kid.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>A History of Me - Part 1</h2><time>July 8, 2005</time><div><p>For lack of anything else to write I will begin a series of autobiographical articles about me (ego bloating time ;-)). Before I start that, though, I&#39;ll give a quick rundown of the week. I rebuilt our shelves this week: painted them white and added some proper braces. Looks pretty good. I also, more or less, finished the docs module which is nice. Now I can start work on the various game stuff I want to do (hooray :-D!).</p>
<p>But now on to the main subject. This entry&#39;s subject is: A Walk with Computers: My Journey through Technology</p>
<p>My first experience with a computer would probably be the old TI Dad had. Every once in a great while Dad would crack it out and I&#39;d knock myself out pressing random buttons. I thought it was pretty cool to just be pressing buttons. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure when I first came into contact with PCs, but I&#39;d be willing to bet my money that it was one of my relatives. My Uncle Darin had an 8088 and he&#39;d sometimes let me play Concentration or Wheel of Fortune. My Uncle Kurt, rest his soul, had the Mother Goose game. I loved that little game. Not only did it look nice but, hey, it made noises aside from beeps! Of course, in retrospect it&#39;s still just beeps.</p>
<p>I always pined away for the day that we&#39;d have a computer of our own. Whenever I&#39;d go over to my grandparents house they&#39;d have these boards that I&#39;d pound nails into every time I came over. I claimed I was building a computer (lol). But, the years went by and it seemed the day would never come.</p>
<p>That day wouldn&#39;t come until the spring of 1997 when Dad took his old 486 home to do work at home. The first time he fired up MSPaint was magical. My favorite thing to draw was the Death Star blowing up Alderaan (we&#39;d just seen the Special Edition of A New Hope). Then came the day that literally changed my life. All hip to learn about this new frontier I got some little kiddie books out of the library on computers. In the back of one of them was a couple of programs written in QBasic. Thinking about it now it was a good thing that computer had a Win95 <em>upgrade</em> because otherwise QBasic would not have been on there and I wouldn&#39;t be writing this now. But, anyways, I put in those programs and was just blown away by the fact that a normal human being like me could program the computer. So I started &quot;reverse engineering&quot; their code and taught myself how to use QBasic. It took a long time before I finally got to the level of making an actual game. </p>
<p>It was early 1999 and the game was Plane Attack, an ASCII based Battleship style game (though the enemy jumped around to random spots). If you were in line with the enemy you&#39;d have the option to shoot it (which was a guess the number thing). My next game, and first time to dabble in graphics, was &quot;Mario Mash&quot;. You&#39;d move little Mario towards a turtle and jump on it. Exciting, eh?</p>
<p>By the time &#39;99 came around the magic of the 486 was starting to wear off. Games were on the market that we couldn&#39;t play. For a while the problem was a lack of sound hardware but then it was 3D accel cards and Pentiums that became all the rage. Luckily I didn&#39;t have to suffer too long because in September of &#39;99 we bought the first Dell. Around the same time, on the day my grandpa died IIRC, I also bought an old Mac Plus at a garage sale (and now that I think about it I think we still owe that lady $5 bucks...). That only lasted about half a year, though. A gift card of mine got shoved into the disk drive so I opened it up and got it out, but when I got every thing back together the drive didn&#39;t work. My guess now is that I had the cable in backwards but I knew of no such thing back then.</p>
<p>My next big step in programming would be the day I got VBasic for my birthday. I&#39;d seen the thing sitting at our local Staples during the 486 era, but it certainly wasn&#39;t up to the task. Up until I got it, which was in 2000, I&#39;d kind of forgotten about it. So that first night I was trying to write a game. I&#39;d  done some experimenting with VBA for Excel so I knew a little bit about what I was doing, but not much. Needless to say I didn&#39;t succeed. Eventually, over the years, I learned about WinAPI and DirectX and that&#39;s basically where I am today, though I did pick up some C++ along the way somewhere. That probably came in when I started:</p>
<p>Web development! Before the turn of the century the library had gotten computers with Internet acces. Of course this was another exciting realm for me. I could find sites about Final Fantasy 3 and listen to the music while away from the console! The site I liked in particular still exists today (and it hasn&#39;t changed a bit): <a href="http://discover-net.net/~jasonds/">Final Fantasy III, The Ultimate Page</a>. The newness of the Internet wore off over time and I wanted to make my own presence on the web. Where the heck I learned about Geocities I don&#39;t know, but I did and the big debut was on June 1, 2000. We had just found out that Mom was pregnant with our first sister so that was the big headline. I used the WYSIWYG editor they had which served well for a time. It wasn&#39;t until Christmas of 2000 or 2001 when I used a gift card to buy a bargain book on VBScript. Hilariously I couldn&#39;t tell you anything about VBScript because for me that book was an HTML primer. So I made my first HTML website and loaded it up. For the time it looked pretty cool. Every so often I&#39;d want to add new features and I&#39;d rewrite the site from scratch. Then came the day where that static HTML just wasn&#39;t going to work anymore. I was trying to make a poll but couldn&#39;t figure out how to write the parameters file to the server.</p>
<p>Now before I can finish <em>that</em> story I have to start another. One day when I was at <a href="http://www.rookscape.com/vbgaming/">Lucky&#39;s VB Gaming</a> site and I figured I&#39;d actually look at his links page. There was a link for a so called &quot;Young Programmers Network&quot; and I was instantly intrigued. Not too much before I had tried to start this kind of a group on Yahoo! to see if there was anybody else out there with my kind of talent (I was so naive) so to see that somebody else had actually done such a feat blew me away. So I signed up and made my debut: <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/visual-basic-game-programming-contest.html">A VB game contest</a>. So thus I was indoctrinated into the YPN, the next big thing in my life. I do need to explain that this is where my infamous nickname of dxprog started. At the time I had begun writing games utilizing DirectX and I figured that was fitting: DirectX PROGrammer.</p>
<p>Also, something else I should mention. Somewhere in 2001, I believe, I started yearning to have my own PC. We had just hit the eBay scene and computer parts were abundant and cheap (if you got ones that were old enough :-P). So I figured I&#39;d build myself and old 486. Well <em>that</em> was stupid. As far as I got was the processor. I believe at my Dad&#39;s 40th birthday party I told my Uncle Darin about that dream and I was hitting him up for spare parts (I also bugged my Uncle Dan. These poor guys :-P). Anyhoo, my birthday rolled around and I got a package from UPS. Back then that was a rarity. It was from Darin and inside was his old P133. I was eccstatic to say the least. I holed myself up in my room and took the thing apart and put it back together and installed Windows and made out with it... okay, not really ;-). But it wasn&#39;t too long after (or maybe at the exact same time) that my Uncle Dan came up from Pheonix. And he brought several box loads of stuff. Talk about guy heaven! Of course, over the years I&#39;ve upgraded (gone through 2 monitors with bad cables) and now I&#39;m pretty much happy with my system (though I kind of want an 80GB HDD, or anything bigger than what I&#39;ve got :-P). There was one point where computer <em>hardware</em> was more fascinating than writing software. I ate, breathed, and slept the stuff. But I guess it wore off at some point because I&#39;m not like that nearly as much anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, now that all that&#39;s out if the way I can continue with the web site quest story. I was trying to figure out how to do that so <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/web-file-io.html">I asked my pals at YPN</a>. I can&#39;t tell you how I figured out how to get ASP going or any of that, but I did and began my journey on web programming. It was around the same time that I saw some pictures of XP in a magazine. I couldn&#39;t believe that that was Windows. So I named my first completely ASP driven site: Matt&#39;s Page XP. When that proved inadequate I rewrote it from scratch and I still have the code for that one. But I didn&#39;t like <em>that</em> either so I rewrote it <em>again</em> this time I actually named the engine, Fishion I (notice the beginning of the fish names), and I called it The M Zone.</p>
<p>So things were working out quite well for me. I was writing games and making web sites. The only thing I wanted was to be a moderator of YPN (yeah, I wanted it). The opportunity showed up when KaGez put out a &quot;help wanted&quot; for the new YPN engine: partyfish. I said I&#39;d help and he signed me on. My first job was to write the search engine. And, surprisingly, I did it. It was bloody slow, but it worked. But after that things went downhill: whenever I&#39;d add a feature something would break down. This kept happening until I said &quot;SCREW IT!&quot; and started over from scratch. That engine I called YPNgine and it was pretty good for my level at that time (I&#39;d been working with PHP for about 4-6 months). That actually made it to release and served YPN for a while, until it too started to break down under the stress. That&#39;s when I sat and said &quot;HEY! I need to make something that is going to work in any situation and can be easily patched or upgraded.&quot; I had been reading a book on game programming that utilized object oriented programming and the light clicked: Tetra was born.</p>
<p>The first things I did on Tetra was make some homemade cache and templating modules. Tetra became something so powerful and simple to work with that every site I&#39;ve created since that February day in 2004 has had Tetra at its core. And I hate to ring my bell here but I believe that it&#39;s probably my finest work.</p>
<p>With all this web development, though, I didn&#39;t have much time for game programming. I mean, I was running YPN, I was running the site for the parish and somebody from Arkansas wanted me to make a wbe site for them too. So I&#39;d been swimming in a buttload of web work with little room for anything else. Until one day just a couple months ago. I was prowling around Gamedev.net and there was an article about a <a href="http://contest.createdbyx.com">VisualBasic game contest</a>. I figured, &quot;Hey! Here&#39;s my chance to finally make a game and maybe get something out of it too.&quot; Oh I got something out of it (and I&#39;m not just talking about the prize ;-)). I decided to make a clone of my favorite puzzle game: Tetris Attack. I&#39;d tried to do this before but horribly failed. But my resolve to make it this time around had never been stronger. I wanted a game to enter that contest and I wanted a legal version of my favorite game, so I began. Things were going great. I had things figured out and working. But I have this real problem of when I hand my program to somebody else the bugs pop up. So I decided to turn the game over to the pros at <a href="http://www.tetrisattack.net">tetrisattack.net</a>. This was probably the smarted choice I made. The first couple of weeks killed me. &quot;This doesn&#39;t work right&quot; &quot;The real game wouldn&#39;t allow this&quot; &quot;Your physics are really borked!&quot;. It made me want to cry, but I got the problems worked out and it turned out to be a winner (literally). I learned a lot and the completely scriptable sidekick guy formed the basis for a game I currently have planned (but to tell you about it now would be a crime ;-)).</p>
<p>So there it is. Basically my entire history involving computers. I look back now and realize I forgot about some of my early VB game ventures (Space Shoot II, Space Invaders and Eat), but you get the gist of it ;-). Stay tuned for part II: My First Love: Nintendo!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>We is in the paper... kind of</h2><time>July 1, 2005</time><div><p>While we&#39;re not mentioned directly (at the parents request) the local paper, Examiner Enterprise (aka Teh Typo Tymes), <a href="http://www.examiner-enterprise.com/articles/2005/06/30/lifestyles_and_entertainment/c588.txt">ran an article</a> on the group that&#39;s been helping us get the house whipped into shape. Now this is a crummy recreation of what&#39;s in the paper, but until I can get all the pictures scanned and stuff this&#39;ll have to do.</p>
<p>But enough of the nicey, nice stuff. Tomorrow they&#39;re coming again to finish the painting but this time <em>I&#39;m</em> here. Bwa ha ha ha! I AM MATTBERT, EVIL DIRECTOR OF QUALITY CONTROL! BWA HA HA!! It&#39;s not quite done yet, but I&#39;ve even rigged up a Dilbert style self-portrait of myself (which I will have online once the UDM is finished).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the UDM is coming along quite nicely. I got a ton of work done today and everything is looky pretty spanky! You can take a <a href="http://tetra.dyndns.org/docs">looksee</a> if you want.</p>
<p>Well, I need to get some sleep so I have plenty of energy for whip cracking... I mean.. painting tomorrow ;-). G&#39;night!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Of paint and spackle</h2><time>June 26, 2005</time><div><p>Yesteray began day one of the house rennovating project. I was out helping mom with little kids but I plan on staying next Saturday to be the Supervisor from Hell(R) :-D. Some sanding and spackle jobs done by the teens who are pulling this off was... well, not professional. And while I don&#39;t expect them to be perfect, painting over screws and nails is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Saw an <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,120341,pg,1,00.asp">interesting article</a> about how people ranked their ISP. SBC was pretty up there and, to my joy, AOL was dead last. Guess I&#39;m not the only one who thinks of it as <strong>AO</strong>-he<strong>L</strong>.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Days like this don&#x27;t come too often...</h2><time>June 21, 2005</time><div><p>Indeed, they don&#39;t. To start my day off I was awakened with the news that my copy of Zelda: The Minish Cap came. And on top of that I also got my first trial issue of Nintendo Power. Of course, this was all dampened by the news that American School sent me Geometry. Fun....</p>
<p>Okay, so that was all cool in and of itself (except the geometry). I then carried out my normal routine of checking <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com">ACC</a>, <a href="http://www.youngprogrammers.net/">YPN</a>, and <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>. After that, being at a loss of what else to do, I decided to see if a verdict had been reached on the <a href="http://contest.createdbyx.com">game contest</a> I entered. I was expecting the &quot;Judging is now taking place&quot; message which has greeted me so many times in the last three weeks. But instead, there on the front page were screenshots of my game and in glorious, itilicized large font &quot;Winner: TAttack&quot;. Now, you tell me that if that were to happen to you you wouldn&#39;t be a little eccstatic ;-). So I will now be awaiting my free copy of VB.NET standard (which, ironically, is the same promotional thing I got rid of just a couple months ago :-P). I plan on finding some sort of cheap .NET book at Gardener&#39;s this Saturday and selling the whole kit and kaboodle on eBay (just like last time). I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;ll do with the money yet, but for the moment I&#39;ll think I stash it into savings for safe keeping until I pick up my copy of Zelda: Twilight Princess in Novemeber. Chances are, though, that I&#39;ll have a job by then and it won&#39;t be an issue.</p>
<p>This day was a long time in coming, and it&#39;ll be a long time till something like that happens again. But I&#39;ll be waiting ;-).</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Oy!</h2><time>June 16, 2005</time><div><p>I&#39;m currently bogged down by a bunch of various projects and am having some trouble getting myself motivated to complete them. The biggest is, yet again, Tetra. I&#39;m also starting some GBA dev and trying to get ACPD3 finished.</p>
<p>In other news, I finally seem to have gotten accustomed to the grips in my bowling ball. The other night I shot my current all time high of 172... very sweet :-D. I also shot an all time high series of 501.. also very sweet ;-). I&#39;m hoping to take advantage of some of that beautiful free bowling tonight or tomorrow. Dad&#39;s got the rest of the week off so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too hard to swing ;-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gotten myself hooked on Final Fantasy III/VI again. <a href="http://www.consoleclassix.com">Console Classix</a> is a very, very cool thing :-) (though, I&#39;m kind of mooching off my younger brother&#39;s subscription ;-)). I&#39;d forgotten how great that game is. I&#39;m considering getting the FF anthology that was released for the Playstation, but I&#39;m not sure yet. One thing I am sure of is that this weekend I&#39;ll be reserving my copy of Twilight Princess... it looks oh so cool!</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve bored y&#39;all to tears, but hey, now you get ae more personal insight into the person known as... dxprog!</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Whew!</h2><time>June 5, 2005</time><div><p>Just got finished going through a rigorous exercise course with the babies and now I&#39;m beat. Good time to write a blog entry ;-).</p>
<p>I decided to pick up the threads of ACPD3. I&#39;ve been having fun getting the idiot BSTRs to work again :-P. I&#39;m going to be moving as much as I can to the DLL this time around and figuring out how to avoid DLL hell, too. For a change people actually seem to be interested this time. But I also basically said I&#39;m shooting to make an Anicro replacement and went for the people who use it. A brilliant strategy :-D.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>My REAL Blog</h2><time>June 3, 2005</time><div><p>Here it is, Tetra Blog (beta)! Coming down the road are a few more styles, and the ability to add sidebars. These can be any Tetra sidebar so I&#39;m going to be rigging up an RSS feed reader sometime in the near future. That combined with the <echoy effect>Universal Document Module</echoy effect> will make Tetra quite a nicely rounded little CMS :-). And for anybody who&#39;d make a rebuttal to that last statement, Tetra is mainly for personal sites or small groups (like YPN), so SHUT UP! ;-).</p>
<p>Ah, I think I shall play some games tonight. I haven&#39;t done that in heaven knows how long :-P. That ought to change pretty quick once I have Twilight Princess in my hot little hands ;-). I do have my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/TAttack.zip">TAttack</a> game. One of the reasons I made it was so that I could play that again (leagally). Well, at least my bros and people on <a href="http://www.tetrisattack.net">tetrisattack.net</a> are enjoying it.</p>
<p>Of course, I could pick up the loose threads of <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ACPatDes.zip">ACPD</a> 3 and continue the &quot;war&quot; on Anicro Desapro. Of course, for all I know, ACPD is the most used pattern maker on ACC (probably not, though :-P). Oh well.</p>
<p>Well, I got kind of long winded in that :-P. &#39;Night :-)</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Hopping on the .NET bandwagon...</h2><time>June 2, 2003</time><div><p>I have seen the light. I&#39;m moving away from traditional programming in favor of .NET. If it|qs the way of the future then I&#39;d better get into gear. Besides, since the compiled code for C# and VB.NET ends up the same, it doesn&#39;t matter which one I use. They&#39;ll both be exactly the same.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Making Animatics...</h2><time>June 2, 2003</time><div><p>Things are really coming along on the Star Wars movie. I have made a few animatics and am getting ready for the big post-production heck ahead. All I have to say is, thanks heavens for freeware.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Answer to Last Month&#x27;s Trivia Question</h2><time>May 7, 2003</time><div><p>Okay, here&#39;s the answer to last month&#39;s poll question. Before I give the answer I will give a brief history, because it was really a trick question. <em>Esentially</em> the first <em>home computer</em> was the Apple in 1976. Ther in lies the trick. The PC was born in (drum roll) 1981 by IBM. The Apple really has never been considered a PC. So there you have it.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>The M Zone Revised</h2><time>May 4, 2003</time><div><p>Okay, I did it again. And I think I can live with the changes this time. Aside from totally reworking the engine from scratch, I have made several additions. Here we go <br><ul><li>I got rid of the recipe page. Nobody was using it.<li> I cahnged the whole interface of the Picture Gallery<li> I added the theater page<li>Made some changes to the Tech Center<li>Made poll, picture, and news archivable<li>Made a few design changes (but I guess you noticed that)</ul>Well, enjoy the site.</p>
</div></article><article><h2>Moving on...</h2><time>April 27, 2003</time><div><p>After years of speculation and pre-production, our movie finally makes it to film (sort of). We&#39;re using fancy pants digital filming technology (a fifty dollar camera) and  trial software to pull together the best Star Wars movie since Episode II (I hope). Shooting began in early April and has trudged on slowly. We have been trying to rig up camera tracks (nothing decent yet), but the one thing that <em>is</em> done  is the lightsaber fight. It&#39;s AWESOME!!! We couldn&#39;t wait for post-production to pull that one together (it&#39;s almost all spruced up :-). We will hopefully be done with the whole thing by the end of summer. Then comes Episode VIII.</p>
