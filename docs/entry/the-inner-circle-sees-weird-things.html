This whole Facebook debacle has nary phased me as the whole point I post things on there is for selfless promotion and narcissistic reasons. I want people to read those things. But, there are a couple things I hand out to only an elite few people: my phone number and the privilege of Skyping me. This latter one is especially fun for me.</p>
<p>Sometimes during conversations, something interesting will be said that sets me off on a journey to Photoshop to concoct a visual representation of said mutterings. The fruits of these labors are interesting indeed and I present them here for your enjoyment.</p>
