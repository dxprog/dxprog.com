<p>Chris and I had cold soba while in Sendai this year, though I&#39;m pretty sure the broth was nothing like this. To be honest, I haven&#39;t yet bothered to look up a recipe, but this sauce has worked pretty universally with various Japanese types of cuisine.</p>
<p>Authentic? Probably not.</p>
<p>Delicious?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
