In fact, I made some great strides in the graphics department as you can see below.</p>

<p>Not perfect, of course, but much, much better. So much better, in fact, that YouTube flagged this video as having copyrighted material from VisualArts whereas it didn&#39;t in the last one.</p>
<p>Sadly, all that graphics code is getting scrapped as I move everything over to HTML5 canvas, so really I&#39;m back at square one.</p>
