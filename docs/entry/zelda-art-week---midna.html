So I decided to do Midna today. There are parts of this picture I kind of like but overall I really hate it. First off she looks like a guy. Second her head is not wide enough and I scrwed up the shading on the face so it&#39;s hard to make out her eye. The body I&#39;m happier with than what it originally was, but it still seems... off. Ugh. Maybe whatever I draw tomorrow will be better.</p>
