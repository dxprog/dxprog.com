[quote]It&#39;s been nearly twenty-four hours since I last surfed the social web. Despite the cravings I&#39;ve had to see how my karma seeds are growing, I haven&#39;t found it too difficult to not turn the computer on. At work, I kept myself busy with actual work and these math/programming challenges Mickael dug up. At home, I did wind up watching HIMYM because I didn&#39;t feel like torrenting it next week. But since, I&#39;ve kept myself busy with a walk to Wal-mart, making and consuming pumpkin bread, and gratuitous reading. Now, I am drawing myself a batch and will probably read and then turn in.</p>
