I abhor it, even. A couple reasons, A) I&#39;m bad at it, B) it requires an emotional component that I don&#39;t have enough of. That said, I&#39;m going to make a societal rant.</p>
<p>I of course am going to be speaking of the recent unpleasantness going down in France. I&#39;ve been quasi-monitoring various threads on reddit and - unsurprisingly - it would seem the collective world&#39;s head is turned to look at Islam (or, rather, Muslims) as being the cause. Now, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if extremists who claim to be working in the name of this religion are involved, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here. Well, I suppose it is. A lot of the sentiment seems to be around the notion that this particular religion is <em>making</em> people do this.</p>
<p>No. No it&#39;s not. And the people who claim this are themselves probably hypocrites.</p>
<p>I had an interesting thought as I was grabbing a piece of cheese from the fridge. It&#39;s the exact same argument as &quot;video games make those who play them violent&quot;. I&#39;ve written about this before, maybe here, maybe for school, but the answer is: no, of course they don&#39;t. A video game, movie, book, or piece of music doesn&#39;t make you violent. If you&#39;re acting out on things, you were probably pre-disposed to such things already. The <em>exact same idea</em> applies to this notion that a religion will turn somebody violent.</p>
<p>These individuals <em>chose</em> to kill of their own free will. We as humans kind of have that privilege.</p>
<p>In the end it&#39;s not video games and it&#39;s not religion causing people to cause fucked up mayhem against innocent lives. It&#39;s extremely disturbed individuals who will find any reason to validate the horrendous crimes they already want to commit. Intangible concepts don&#39;t cause people to kill.</p>
<p>People do that all by themselves.</p>
<p>And it goes without saying that they are acting and representing themselves and themselves only, not the whole. They may represent a subset of people, but simply by being human, they actually represent all people.</p>
<p>So, if you subscribe to the group mindset, does that not make all of us murderers?</p>
