The ordeal went down like this:</p>
<p><em>walks over to iPad table in Apple store like a boss</em></p>
<p>Apple dude: Hi! Can I help you?</p>
<p>Me: 16GB wifi iPads. Have any?</p>
<p>Apple chick: I have one. Black.</p>
<p>Me: It&#39;s mine!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s verbatim how it went down.</p>
<p>I am enjoying this thing, as I thought I would. My eyes particularly enjoy the very large screen. Been checking out the apps available and sighing over the apps I have that aren&#39;t iPad formatted (lookin&#39; at you, Skype).</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve been looking for options for iOS development on Windows and have a few things I&#39;m going to try. Whilst I may have caved to Apple once again for mobile computing, I refuse to use OS X in areas where I can avoid it.</p>
<p>And just as soon as somebody hacks Windows 8 for this thing, iOS is gone....</p>
<p>(no more blog posts typed on this thing...)</p>
