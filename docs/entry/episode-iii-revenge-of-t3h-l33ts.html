In this episode we mainly ramble on about our thoughts on E3, which starts next Wednesday. Also, we bring you, for the very first time, our &quot;Picks of the Week&quot;. As promised, <a href="http://www.werkema.com/software/spacemonger.html">here&#39;s the link</a> for SpaceMonger. Awesome program, I highly recommend downloading it (or else).</p>
<p>As usual, here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/l33ts/podcasts/l33ts3.mp3">direct link</a> and also handsome icon pointing to our new feed location: [url=<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/T3hL33ts]![]">http://feeds.feedburner.com/T3hL33ts]![]</a>(<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png">http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png</a> &quot;image&quot;)[/url] Please note that the old feed location will be gone by the time the next podcast rolls around, so be sure to update your iTunes.</p>
<p>Also, one last thing I forgot to mention in the podcast (again) is that we&#39;ve got an e-mail addy: <a href="mailto:t3hl33ts@gmail.com">t3hl33ts@gmail.com</a>. So go ahead and send a mail with questions, comments, shout outs, or whatever and we&#39;ll probably read it in the next podcast :-).</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
