Now this is a crummy recreation of what&#39;s in the paper, but until I can get all the pictures scanned and stuff this&#39;ll have to do.</p>
<p>But enough of the nicey, nice stuff. Tomorrow they&#39;re coming again to finish the painting but this time <em>I&#39;m</em> here. Bwa ha ha ha! I AM MATTBERT, EVIL DIRECTOR OF QUALITY CONTROL! BWA HA HA!! It&#39;s not quite done yet, but I&#39;ve even rigged up a Dilbert style self-portrait of myself (which I will have online once the UDM is finished).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the UDM is coming along quite nicely. I got a ton of work done today and everything is looky pretty spanky! You can take a <a href="http://tetra.dyndns.org/docs">looksee</a> if you want.</p>
<p>Well, I need to get some sleep so I have plenty of energy for whip cracking... I mean.. painting tomorrow ;-). G&#39;night!</p>
