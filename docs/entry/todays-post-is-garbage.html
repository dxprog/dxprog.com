The specifics are a bit complex to go over here, but at its core, he wasn&#39;t mentally picture the structure of an array correctly and so was reading his array&#39;s wrong causing them to display as if they were rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really remember having any issues when dealing with arrays, though these days, I generally stick to single dimensional arrays and use math if I need to convert from, say, a screen coordinate to its corresponding spot in the data structure. Particularly, and in the case of our argument, we were talking about reading in a map file. That got me thinking about this trinket I wrote several years ago.</p>

<p>If I recall, this test was more about scripted AI and platform physics, but there was a loadable map aspect as well. Maps are something I&#39;ve played around with for a very long time, one of my first programming mental puzzles being how to generate one that wasn&#39;t gibberish programatically. This was something that baffled me for the longest time, but I eventually did figure something out and even wrote a <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/randmaps.html">tutorial about it</a>.</p>
<p>But, really, this whole little tale and code offering are because I had no idea what to talk about otherwise. I suspect I shall have less issues tomorrow (for reasons that will become clear), but that hardly helps me in the here and now.</p>
