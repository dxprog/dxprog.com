It means I get to such things as lounge around doing <em>jack shit</em> on the days I&#39;m not dancing for the man. I decided to buck that trend this weekend, though, and actually accomplished quite a bit. All of it started with my decision <em>not</em> to hop in line for a Wii U early.</p>
<p>The original idea was to take my brother to work at 2pm and then insert myself into whatever line there was at Walmart (they tell me there&#39;s no dash in that anymore). I was hesitant to say the least. That would have been a near 10 hour wait in a store with only a handful of electronics to keep me company. Despite the fact that I had loaded up a satchel of entertainment, I decided at the last minute to not get in line, resigning myself to not getting a Wii U <em>right now</em>. I could waste my time much more effectively at home.</p>
<p>I actually spent most of the afternoon programming up the last stages of the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/">awwnime bracket</a> to include a wildcard round. In between bouts of frustration, I&#39;d browse around the internet or conversate on IRC, but in the end there were a lot of solid hours of coding done.</p>
<p>Once that was completed, I cleaned my room a little bit and also loaded up the dishwasher from lunch earlier in the day. Then, I caught up on my currently airing shows. I consider this an accomplishment as my laziness has reached heights so high that it feels like a chore to watch television. I think it&#39;s more I don&#39;t like watching shows alone, actually. Not as fun that way.</p>
<p>After retrieving my brother from work, we swung by Walmart to see how long the Wii U line was. The answer to that was a surprising &quot;not very&quot;, and we spent about an hour in a half waiting before walking out with the last available Deluxe unit. I thank the good lord that I decided against the ten hour wait as the 90 minutes we did spend were pretty damned stressful in their own right.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent a goodly bit of time working out the final technical details of my computerized lights setup and began sequencing my first display to music (more info on that soon). I even spent some time chatting with the maternal unit and baked up some cookies. Also shipped my brand new Wii U off for repair because the disc drive doesn&#39;t like reading discs (sucks). But, c&#39;est la vie.</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty damned productive weekend. More productive than I&#39;ve had in a goodly long time.</p>
