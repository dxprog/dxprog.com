Mainly, if for any reason, it is because at our old house there were cats that made a permanent residence there. And when the males went around marking their territory, it wasn&#39;t pretty.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I have another reason to hate cats: It seems I&#39;m allergic to them. Yesterday I went to an allergist to see what the heck I&#39;m allergic to because I have nasty allergies at certain times of the year (and I&#39;ve got asthma so we were there for that too). Well, I went in and they poked my back with all sorts of pollens and stuff. It appears I&#39;m not allergic to anything organic (as in trees and such), just cats and dust mites (apparently I got a huge welt from the dust mite test). They also put me through a treadmill test to test my lung function and I got another surprise there. I&#39;m not asthmatic enough to even be labelled with having activity enduced asthma. So I&#39;m testing that by laying off my inhaler whilst being active and seeing what gives. I made it through bowling last night without a problem. Tomorrow when I go to work I won&#39;t &quot;deasthmaize&quot; and see how I do there.</p>
<p>Speaking of tomorrow it&#39;s my first payday (yay!). It&#39;s driving me insane to see how much I&#39;ve made in the last two weeks. I&#39;ll probably have a picture of me and my check stub up for you people :-)</p>
<p>In the land of NES development I&#39;ve gotten two opcodes interpreted but now I&#39;m stuck on something else: it seems I&#39;m not interpreting the ROM data right. I&#39;ve run my test ROM through a couple of disassemblers and they&#39;re reading the first four bytes in as something else (actually, the two disassemblers had different results. Go figure :-P). I&#39;ll have to do more research to figure this out. In the mean time you can read a blow-by-blow run-down of development <a href="http://www.youngprogrammers.net/index.php/CoolNES">here</a>.</p>
