Today I have received that email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear FutureMe,</p>
<p>Hello from the past! I feel a little strange writing this letter considering how WRONG I was on the previous one. But, here we are.</p>
<p>Looking at 2014 from my vantage point, there shouldn&#39;t be much change from the latter half of 2013; you&#39;ll still be at LinkedIn and, of course, in the Bay Area. I&#39;m hoping that you&#39;ll have become slightly more suave with the ladies because that&#39;s really the last item on the checklist.</p>
<p>Also, there&#39;s the very vague possibility of an Oktoberfest trip with the ol&#39; TN folks. At this point in time, I&#39;m not sure how that will play out or if it will and it wasn&#39;t just a bunch of &quot;Whooo!! Riding the high of life&quot; type talk.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#39;m hoping that summer with Chris hanging out while he interns winds up being every bit as awesome as I&#39;m anticipating right now.</p>
<p>So, get your ass a girlfriend and I&#39;ll see you in a year!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all, that summed up the year pretty accurately. I&#39;m still at LI, still in the bay, and Chris&#39; internship was a lot of fun. Of course, the Oktoberfest trip didn&#39;t happen, but I did wind up visiting all of those folks in their new home of Smogsville, TX just last weekend.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a recurring theme here in the form of &quot;get a girlfriend you big ass&quot;. And, as I prepare to write the letter to myself for next year, that thing will come up yet again. Of course, actually trying to meet somebody would probably be a huge step towards actually realizing this. Having a handful of dates with one girl per year isn&#39;t getting me anywhere very quickly...</p>
