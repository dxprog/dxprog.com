<p>EXT. FOREST - DAY</p>
<p>Two KIDS are throwing rocks into a lake when RANGER BOB steps out from behind some trees</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
Hey, you! Throwing objects into the lake is against
park rules!

KID1
Yeah, so what are you going to do about it?
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob pushes both kids into the lake</p>
<pre><code>KID2
Hey! I thought you couldn&#39;t throw things into the lake

RANGER BOB
I didn&#39;t throw you, I pushed you
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob walks off as kids stare at him
Some people are eating when Ranger Bob approaches</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
I&#39;m sorry, but the park calorie limit is 500. Eating that
will exceed the limit. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to take it.
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob grabs food and walks off eating it humming</p>
<p>EXT. FOREST - NIGHT</p>

And then he rose out of the darkness and saidâ€¦
</code></pre><p>Shadow of Ranger Bob rises behind Kid1</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
This campfire is illegal.


KID2
No it ain&#39;t! We&#39;re not over the border.
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob leans of and blows the fire so the flames are over the line</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to write you two up.
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob walks off</p>
<pre><code>KID1
Jerk!
</code></pre><p>Ranger Bob is in front of a sunset</p>
<pre><code>ANNOUNCER
Ranger Bob, the supreme symbol of national park authority.
</code></pre><p>Kid comes skipping across the scene and Ranger Bob runs after him</p>
<pre><code>RANGER BOB
Hey you
