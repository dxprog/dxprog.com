Through this line I passed and was at the counter rejected because I was trying to check in too early. My flight doesn&#39;t leave for another nine hours, but I like to be early.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always liked to be early.</p>
<p>When I worked at Walmart, if I wasn&#39;t there fifteen minutes before my scheduled clock-in time, I felt late. For any class, appointment, or interview, if I wasn&#39;t fifteen to twenty minutes early, I felt late. Perhaps it&#39;s less that I feel like I was late when I arrived, but I always aimed to hit these early times.</p>
<p>Because you never know what could happen in between.</p>
<p>For example, say you&#39;re commuting to work from 40 miles away. There&#39;s a whole hell of a lot that can happen in between. Weather, car accidents, or perhaps a horny giraffe has died of high blood pressure and is now blocking several lanes of traffic. That extra time works as a great buffer for these kinds of occasions so you can still be, at the very least, on time. If there are no issues, then you&#39;re early and get credit for being punctual.</p>
<p>And certainly, the bullet point on one&#39;s reputation for punctuality is part of the issue at stake. It&#39;s an easy thing to attain on the ever looming &quot;annual review&quot;. A high mark there gives one yet more buffer room on something else - small lapses in product quality, perhaps...</p>
<p>But, outside of that (and more importantly as I realized on the train), it reduces doubt. I am here, planning a sleep over at the airport, because I don&#39;t want anything left to chance on this very big trip of mine. I get as much work done on my projects as soon as I can to make room for the things that got glossed over, the challenges that weren&#39;t foreseen, and any scope creep that may and will occur. I aim to do everything in my power so that if something goes wrong, I did everything I possibly could to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like insurance you get just for being a litte bit impatient, a little bit paranoid, and a little bit proactive.</p>
<p>Well, that killed, like... fifteen minutes...</p>
