I check people out for a living</a></h1><time class="post__published">January 7, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>And checking out hot babes is fun ;-). No, really. Yesterday my job code was officially changed to cashier so now, uhh.... it&#39;s official :-P. Today was my first 8 hour day doing cashier and what what a day it was. Standing in one spot and constantly leaning over to reach people&#39;s stuff takes a nasty toll on your back. And when you&#39;ve been waiting 40 minutes for the managers to send you home it&#39;s even worse :-P. But, overall, I quite enjoy the job (a lot of button pushing ;-)). Tomorrow I work six hours and then, hallelujah, I&#39;m off Monday and Tuesday :-D.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672326612/qid=1136691749/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4/103-2137882-6907848?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">3D game programming book</a> came the other and it&#39;s really a good book. It&#39;s actually written by one of the guys on the DirectX dev team so you know it&#39;s at least accurate :-P. But really, if you&#39;re starting out 3d game programming look into this book.</p>
<p>Lastly, last night I ordered up a (legit) copy of Yoshi&#39;s Island GBA so that should be coming some time next week. I look forward to playing that on my lunch breaks :-).</p>
<p>Yes, it seems my life nhas boiled down to two things: work and programming. But, heck, at least I&#39;m malking money (getting a few hundred dollar paycheck every two weeks rocks ;-)). Until next time, keep those prices rollin&#39;!</p>
