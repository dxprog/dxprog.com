We happened to be on one of the manga floors when some older Japanese dude walks up to us. Now, at this point I&#39;m kind of freaking out because I&#39;m expecting huge language barrier and having to blow him off as rudelessly as I can. But, he starts speaking in what is more than passable English, asking us how we&#39;re enjoying things and, the odd bit, if we wouldn&#39;t mind being filmed for a promotional video for his company.</p>
<p>Well, fuck. This just doesn&#39;t happen every day, less so when you&#39;re in a foreign country.</p>
<p>We agreed to act out a little bit of being in the shop, being interested in things, and bullshitting the worst dialog ever. I assumed that our &quot;dialog&quot; scene was going to be B-roll (without asking, stupidly) and just said random shit. After that, he asked Chris and I a couple questions then handed us his card with instructions to email him with our contact info so he could give us some stills of the shoot. Below are the shots he provided. The funny thing I just realized that all the file names were titled with アメリカ人若者, or &quot;American youth&quot; (as google translates it, all I was able to read was &quot;American&quot;).</p>
