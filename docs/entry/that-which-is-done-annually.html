It&#39;s funny how this has become a thing because I used to be vehemently against &quot;New Year&#39;s Resolutions&quot;, taking that stance that a person should be able enact change at any time of the year. But, moreso than that, it&#39;s a barometer to measure how well those changes actually went. Anybody who knows a little bit about statistics knows that you need to monitor trends over time to get the most accurate data. All that said, let&#39;s see how I did against last year&#39;s list.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - To be fair, I actually started out the year pretty well. I all but ceased fast food and was even getting in my daily walking. However, the move to California but a big fat wrench into all that. I write this have just downed half of a Papa John&#39;s pizza. There were some upsides, though, such as the fact that work is within a bikeable distance. Negating anything gained from that, though, was the big uptick in alcohol consumption. It&#39;s amazing how easy it is to drink when there are other people to drink with.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - Again, the job change had a unique impact on this category. The hard goals I had set out for myself were to reduce superfluous spending and eliminate my LASIK, credit card, and car debts. The middle two I actually accomplished and the car is within reach. However, if anything, the amount of money I dropped on a whim definitely increased, but because of the salary adjustment, I wasn&#39;t hurting as much for it.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - I bought the stuff and made absolutely no progress on this at all.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - Mission accomplished with a repeat trip tentatively planned for 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Pfffffft!</p>
<h2 id="the-2014-version">The 2014 Version</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to shoot for simplicity this year, so here&#39;s the plan (that I will not follow):</p>
<p><strong>Eat Better</strong> - Again, fast food moratorium (as soon as my Taco Bell gift card is gone and the aforementioned pizza). It&#39;s easy enough to eat healthy at work (portion control being the most difficult part), but this needs to be carried over when I&#39;m not there. Going to have to compile a list of not-terrible-for-me-but-good-for-my-tastebuds recipes.</p>
<p><strong>Bike 150 miles every month</strong> - Once over the initial &quot;three week to develop a habit&quot; hump, this will actually be easy. My round trip work commute is twelve miles, so if I did that five days a week, that&#39;d actually be 200+ miles per month. I&#39;m giving a little bit of slack though. Start slow and all that.</p>
<p><strong>The Girlfriend Factor</strong> - I&#39;ve been single long enough. Time to push past my shyness and make that shit happen.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#39;d say two of those three things is attainable. We&#39;ll see what things are looking like when I write this post again next year.</p>
