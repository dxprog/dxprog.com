For those of you who don&#39;t know I am the creator of such infamous items as the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/cc.html">&quot;Common Cold&quot;</a> and the <a href="http://dxprog.com/pics/dv_pancake.jpg">&quot;Darth Vader Pancake&quot;</a>. However, this eBay auction is a little more sane... just a little. At the very least I&#39;m selling more or less a legitimate item... an e-mail address. That&#39;s right, <a href="mailto:loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com">loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com</a> (yes, I actually managed to snag that address). I&#39;m hoping there are plenty of Zelda fans out there who&#39;d like this address and after an Xbox 360 gmail addy went for $570 how can I lose. It&#39;ll only be a quarter if I do :-P. But, anyways...</p>
<p>Thursday is pay day again. I&#39;ve made up a spreadsheet to keep track of my hours and take out all the proper taxes and according to that this paycheck will be about $316.60 (54 hours worked). I&#39;ve also calculated my current schedule through to the 15th and I&#39;ll have just enough to pull out my laptop! YAY! :-D</p>
<p>Later :-)</p>
