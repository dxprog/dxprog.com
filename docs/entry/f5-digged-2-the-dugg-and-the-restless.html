<p>Note - I was originally going to call Kevin a mustard in that last frame (only not quite as nice), however, I thought it would be more in character for him to swear.</p>
<p>Note 2 - Oh, and since I don&#39;t know what the heck Keith looks like, I decided to have Gabe from <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> make a cameo appearance. I may do things like that from time to time. &#39;Tis fun ;-)</p>
