<p>Once upon a time, I used to enjoy the snow. My brothers and I would make giant snow forts using spare laundry detergent buckets and then spend the next several days pummeling these impenetrable <em>fortrii</em> with the meanest snowballs we could conjure up. Snow was indeed a wondrous thing, but not so much now. No, my time working at a television station has forever ruined snow for me.</p>
<p>For now &quot;snow&quot; means scrambling to ensure that systems are working correctly, driving many miles in treacherous weather or, in tonight&#39;s case, being pent up in a hotel some blocks away from my place of employ instead of at home enjoying good food and watching Death Note with my brothers.</p>
<p>One day I will no longer work at a TV station and perhaps maybe the beauty and glory that is snow will return to me. I hope so, because on the off-chance I produce offspring, I don&#39;t want to pass on this miserly attitude I&#39;ve developed over the past year.</p>
