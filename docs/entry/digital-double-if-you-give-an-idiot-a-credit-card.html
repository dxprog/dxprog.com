<p>I decided that &quot;The Plagiarist&quot; will be a reccurring series instead of blowing the whole thing at once. This&#39;ll allow me to do many more comics.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s subject, however, is something that has been peeving my off quite a bit lately. Idiots just don&#39;t know how to swipe their credit cards and, for that matter, just expect you to spoonfeed them the answers to everything. Little do they realize that soon the only smart people left will be cashiers and we will rise up and take over the earth!!!</p>
