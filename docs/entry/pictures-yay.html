<p>I seem to be missing pictures of the master bedroom as well as Steve and Joe&#39;s room, but that&#39;s the gist of it. </p>
<p>Most of our stuff (and when I say our I&#39;m usually refferring to Jeff, Chris and myself since we are roomies) is all packed and ready to go.</p>
<p>Well, we&#39;re getting down to the wire on this but it looks like we&#39;re gonna make it! Part of me is kind of sad that we&#39;re going to leave this house (I mean, I&#39;ve lived here 18 out of 19 years of my life), but it&#39;ll be nice to move on.</p>
