I was out helping mom with little kids but I plan on staying next Saturday to be the Supervisor from Hell(R) :-D. Some sanding and spackle jobs done by the teens who are pulling this off was... well, not professional. And while I don&#39;t expect them to be perfect, painting over screws and nails is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Saw an <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,120341,pg,1,00.asp">interesting article</a> about how people ranked their ISP. SBC was pretty up there and, to my joy, AOL was dead last. Guess I&#39;m not the only one who thinks of it as <strong>AO</strong>-he<strong>L</strong>.</p>
