To be fair, there was a rather deadly Oscars drinking game involved. It&#39;s helped bolster the feeling I&#39;ve been having that... I actually kind of <em>miss</em> not drinking. To that end, I shall just try to drink less. Also, not whiskey.</p>
<p>But, that&#39;s not today&#39;s post. Nah, today I&#39;m not sure what to write about, so I&#39;m just going to post the thing I <em>did</em> write yesterday, namely the one year lookback for my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/dxprog">RedditBooru/AnimeBracket Patreon</a>. For those not aware, Patreon is a crowd-funding site where people can donate to creators on a per project or monthly basis. Over the years running these sites, I&#39;ve had many people ask if they could donate money, and generally, I turned those down. But, I actually calculated the server costs one day and decided that Patreon would be a good way to offset costs. It&#39;s been way more successful than I had imagined and I&#39;m very touched that folks are actually willing to monetarily help out these little projects of mine.</p>
<p>But enough actual writing, time to exercise my copy/paste abilities.</p>
<h2 id="one-year-later"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/one-year-later-17363919">One Year Later</a></h2>
<p>It&#39;s now been one year since I started this little Patreon, and I want to take a look back on the last year, both in continuing to be completely transparent about the costs but also what was achieved. Finally, I&#39;m going to outline my plans for this year.</p>
<p>First off, costs. Instead of shoe-horning a spreadsheet into this post, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RJWevaMKnnLgRydd3EHV2Y8UU-JGsCSTx7UerP49Esg/view?usp=sharing">here&#39;s an actual spreadsheet with the breakdown</a>. TL;DR - Patron support over the last year covered one third of all hosting costs! And this was with two additional servers being brought on and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/recent-outage-in-14020838">bad software on my part literally adding hundreds of dollars to the bill</a>. Adding that thumbnail server has ultimately saved money.</p>
<p>So, here are the things that were accomplished since February of last year:</p>
<p><strong>AnimeBracket</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New home page design with featured popular brackets</li>
<li>New elimination round admin tools</li>
<li>Code made PHP7 ready (even though it&#39;s running on HHVM)</li>
<li>Lots of <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/anime-bracket/commits/master">various small fixes</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RedditBooru</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entire site is SSL enabled</li>
<li>Thumb generation was made its own service, massively reducing costs and adding stability</li>
<li>Better image sizing for gallery pages</li>
<li>Browser extension updated for Chrome/Firefox</li>
<li>Lots of <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/reddit-booru/commits/master">various fixes</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
<p>AnimeBracket definitely has the lions share of things immediately planned. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ant-cheating measures. Things got really bad towards the end of last year with people submitting hundreds of votes from bot accounts.</li>
<li>The ability to rollback brackets to previous rounds. I would&#39;ve liked to have finished this last year.</li>
<li>Open up AnimeBracket to non-anime brackets by adding categories and moving to new site</li>
</ul>
<p>And for RedditBooru:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mod tools. People have always been a little confused on how to get their subreddits indexed and my leaving reddit has exacerbated that a bit. Additionally, giving mods the ability to set the config options I do by hand is probably a good idea.</li>
<li>The number of indexed subreddits is starting to create some UI issues, so I need to take a look at that</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#39;s a look back and a peek forward. Thanks again so much for your support and I look forward to what happens in the upcoming year!</p>
