Why? Because I can. That, my friend, is the beauty of the internets.</p>
<p>Top 5 Games I Wasted Too Much Time Playing</p>
<p><strong>5. Guitar Hero (I and II)</strong>
I will go on the record and say this is probably the best game of this generation. If I were getting paid per hour to play this game the same amount I&#39;m getting paid to push carts I&#39;d be freakin&#39; rich. I figure I&#39;ve probably played Freebird alone somewhere around 50-100 times and it&#39;s a ten minute song. It never really gets old.</p>
<p><strong>4. Final Fantasy VI</strong>
Only the best RPG made for the SNES, nay, of all time. I&#39;ve fully completed this game three times, partially many more, and I plan on playing through it again before I head off to college. It&#39;s that good.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past</strong>
I remember the first time I finally made it through this game. I&#39;d been playing it for darn near a year. I probably explored every nook and cranny and thensome. I&#39;ve since made it through twice on GBA and clocked many more hours on PC via emulation. Defeinitely one of the best games ever.</p>
<p><strong>2. Super Mario Bros. 3</strong>
The very first game I ever played. I haven&#39;t played this one to completion as many times as other games (due mainly to the fact that there&#39;s no save in the original NES version) but I did play it almost every day for pretty much the entire life of my first NES (two or three years). I have it on for my NES now (and I crack it out once in a while) and have the GBA version. This game pretty much set and holds the standard for all patforming games. Nothing&#39;s come close since.</p>
<p><strong>1. Tetris Attack</strong>
Oh, my gosh. Where to begin. I&#39;ve clocked more hours on this game than probably all the others combined. I&#39;ve spent countless hours writing this game on five different occasions (and am currently doing so again). I haven&#39;t bought Plant Puzzle League for DS because I&#39;m a Tetris Attack purist. Give me Blargg or give me death! Actually, I probably should buy it just for the online play, but I&#39;d use standard controls. None of this touch screen crap.</p>
<p>I do need to mention that Rogue Squadron, Episode I Racer, Zelda OoT, and Mario 64 are close runner ups. So, there you have it. Day one completed. Stay tuned for more inaninty on here at dxprog.com.</p>
