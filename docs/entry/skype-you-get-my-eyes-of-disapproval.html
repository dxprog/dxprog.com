<p>So, recently, my bros have had a couple accounts hacked (one email, one Steam). Fearing that I was next in line, I started changing all my passwords using the scheme laid out above: very long passwords consisting of easy to remember normal words/phrases.</p>
<p>First, I changed my facebook password. It complained that my password was &quot;weak&quot;, but allowed me to proceed.</p>
<p>Twitter was all &quot;dude, that password is very secure&quot; and I&#39;m like &quot;hells, yes. They get it.&quot;</p>
<p>My bank limited me to 14 characters, so I said fuck it as that&#39;s the only place I use that password and my user name and banking institution would need to be known. Also, they lock my account after three failed login attempts at which point I must call. Whatever, we&#39;ll let that one slide.</p>
<p>And then we come to Skype. Now, Skype is the only program that didn&#39;t get a password change after my too-commonly used password was leaked (in md5 hash form) from one of the lulz sec releases in the spring. (Why I didn&#39;t change it, I don&#39;t know). I figured now may was well be that time.</p>
<p>So, I entered <em>skypeissomehowmuchbetterthanvoip</em> into both boxes and it gave me the green check mark of &quot;you&#39;re good&quot;. Click the submit button. </p>

<p>Okay, I disapprove, but whatever. I&#39;ll roll with it.</p>
<p><em>skypeiskindastupid</em></p>
<p>18 characters, close enough. Green check mark, submit.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_number.png" alt="" title="Really?"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p><em>fuckyouskypefucky00</em> (hard to tell with Georgia, but those are zeroes on the end)</p>
<p>19 characters, with numbers, plenty long and certainly memorable. Again, green check, submit.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/pass_complexity.png" alt="" title="WTF?"></p>
<p>So, let me get this straight. My old, six character, one number, one caps password is just fine and dandy, but a long string which (yes, contains words, repeating even) isn&#39;t? Really?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#39;m a trifle pissed. And as I write this, I <em><strong>still</strong></em> haven&#39;t changed that password. And I&#39;m going to email this to Skype and tell them exactly what I think of this bullshit.</p>
<p>Okay, soapbox done.</p>
