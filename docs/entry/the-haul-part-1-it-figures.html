But, crashing on my couch onto a pile of pillows in a room that&#39;s not tiny is a good feeling.</p>
<p>But, that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>No, today begins a series of posts on all the shit I bought while overseas. Oddly enough, I actually came in fairly under budget on the trip while getting everything I&#39;d wanted plus more; it was a success to be sure.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s show-and-tell is of the figures that were purchased. Figures were near the top of my list of things that I had planned on spending money on. Luckily, I found most of them at pretty decent prices (three of the larger ones I got for $3/per). I&#39;m quite pleased with the haul, though there were a couple of characters that I just couldn&#39;t find any figures of. Either way, my quest for a 3D girlfriend has now become more difficult.</p>

<p>The tiny figures I&#39;m going to store on my desk at work. Everybody else has their desks decorated in some way, so it&#39;s high time I did mine.</p>
