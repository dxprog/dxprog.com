<p>And what a shaming I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I have eaten out several times this week (once being Taco Bell) and had a drinking party last night. Granted, my brother is in town and we&#39;re celebrating New Year&#39;s a bit belatedly, so I&#39;m going to write it off this once. On the upside, I have made more food and not had McDonald&#39;s in this thirteenth year of the 21st century.[break]</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - The last of my pre-ordered items came rolling in and I bought the Mac mini that I&#39;d been planning on buying anyways (with any luck, I can make that money back on the App Store). The slate for purchasing goods is now empty with nothing on the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Japanese</strong> - My books have arrived and I will begin in earnest tomorrow evening... just as soon as I figure out how to proceed...</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - This certainly doesn&#39;t need its own section, but since my brother was in town, we hashed many of the details. The date has been formalized and tickets will be purchased very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I drew but on thing from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily">/r/sketchdaily</a> and that was the one posted on the 1st. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pCMJM.jpg">It&#39;s supposed to be a snake, but it just looks like shit</a>. Need to get back into this.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s where things lie. Hopefully this coming week will be a little better in that it will be a standard week with no deviations from the normal routine. (I still love you though, Chris...)</p>
