<p>I actually drew this back towards the beginning of the comic, but I never actually finished it because I didn&#39;t like Jimmy&#39;s running stance. It seems a little out of place now that Jimmy is the straight man, but it&#39;s a comic. I would&#39;ve put the comic I started today up, but I want to spend a little extra time making this series look decent. So there you have it.</p>
