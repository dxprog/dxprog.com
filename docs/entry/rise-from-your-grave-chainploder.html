Some of these had some pretty cool concepts behind them but, for whatever reason, I never completed them. So, in a series of blog posts shamelessly ripping a line of dialog from Altered Beast, I will present to you some of the cooler of these projects - complete with all their original source code. Today&#39;s highlight is Chainploder.</p>
<p>Chainploder is, in its essence, a blatent rip off of some game I saw on digg and then again on Facebook. This game consisted of a playing field full of bouncing circles and you had to clear a certain amount of them by starting a chain reaction from a single point. I figured this would be a pretty simple thing to code, so I got on Skype and spun up another coding challenge with my bro  (as I am wont to do). I don&#39;t recall all the details, but I don&#39;t think I spent much more than an hour working on this.</p>
<div id="flash_embed"><script type="text/javascript">$(function(){$(&quot;#flash_embed&quot;).flash({swf:&quot;<a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.swf&quot;">http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.swf&quot;</a>, width:630, height:375})});</script></div>

<p>As you can see, my weapon of choice was Flash (I was into that at the time). You may also notice that the game buggy and crappy. Granted, it&#39;s not terrible for 162 lines of code.</p>
<p>So, there is my first highlight. This is probably the most recent project of the things I will showcase later, and probably one of the only ones that won&#39;t be Visual Basic. But, I believe it&#39;s a good kick off.</p>
<p>Oh, you can get the source here: <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/Chainploder.fla">Download</a> (Flash CS4)</p>
