Ever since I made the jump to Winnercomm, I&#39;ve been bombarded by a goodly number of people trying to recruit me every month. Since moving to the Valley, nothing&#39;s changed except now the companies are ones I&#39;ve heard of. But today... I received perhaps one of the more bizarre ones I&#39;ve seen yet:</p>
<p>[b]SUBJECT: You&#39;re an anime fan - I am Monica w/ [Redacted] :)[/b]</p>
<p>[quote]Hi Matt,</p>
<p>I am Monica, a community manager at [Redacted], a platform for finding companies that fit you. I saw that you&#39;re an anime fan-- what are your favorite shows? Are you watching anything good right now? I just finished watching Free! and really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Also I saw that you worked at LinkedIn and did web development on the LinkedIn profile pages, emails, and horizontal JS framework migration efforts. Thatâ€™s awesome! But, if you are ready for something new (along with a 25%+ salary bump) we know that JobVite needs help doing JS development along with Java backend services development. You may not have direct experience with that but I saw that you were endorsed for Java on LinkedIn and I thought it would be worth asking. :)</p>
<p>[Redacted corporate shill because they don&#39;t get free advertisement from me]</p>
<p>If I bothered you and you don&#39;t want to be contacted in the future, let me know and I will make sure we don&#39;t reach out again. I will also be happy to say I am sorry with a beer (we are partial to porters) or a coffee (black!) :) [/quote]</p>
<p>This has all the hallmarks of being both a handwritten letter and also one generated by a cold and unfeeling robot (though, being the Bay Area, probably a sexy one).</p>
<p>So it opens up by declaring I am an anime fan, not something like &quot;I see that you&#39;re an anime fan&quot;, just &quot;YOU ARE ANIME FAN!&quot; This is not untrue, but probably the oddest way to open a recruiting email I&#39;ve yet seen. I had originally written a sentence here about how people would know I like anime (blog/reddit account), but it&#39;s essentially plastered all over my LinkedIn profile. Still, stranger than the fact that anime was the opener was the fact that a super recent show was mentioned (<a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/free-iwatobi-swim-club">Free!</a> just wrapped its twelve episode run last Thursday).</p>
<p>Okay, one point for not being a bot. But that all comes into question with the first sentence of paragraph two where basically every word is lifted <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mhackmann">right out of my profile</a>. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Verbatim_diskette_(2">Verbatim</a>.jpg). That&#39;s super bot like (or incredibly lazy). The rest of the paragraph is too well crafted to be a bot, especially the mention of the Java endorsement (which has a story behind it that I find rather humorous).</p>
<p>The damning piece of evidence against this being a robot (outside of the fact that it was obviously written by a human), is that GMail was kind enough to link to her Google+ account in the right rail. And, I must say, I like what I see. If what she&#39;s saying about anime and the various other nerd type things she posts on her... whatever Google+ calls a &quot;wall&quot;... are true, perhaps I should take her up on that beer/coffee offer.</p>
<p>That <em>date</em> will have nothing to do with future employment.</p>
