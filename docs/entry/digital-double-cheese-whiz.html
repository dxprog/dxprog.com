<p>Alright, first off the name&#39;s changed from F5 to Digital Double. Why? Well, I believe that more accurately reflects the intent of the strip as it&#39;s supposed to loosely be based off my life (my digital double). So that&#39;s that.</p>
<p>As for the comic itself, that stemmed from a <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/headlines/H_3155/35.shtml#headline">crack</a> induced conversation I had with devusb last week. This happens quite often. It&#39;s kind of scary...</p>
