<p>If you managed to stumble upon my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/blid-blog-rampagge">previous blog post</a>, you may be wondering how drunk I was exactly. Except you won&#39;t, because LASIK was one of the only words that managed to not be garbled in my blind fury.</p>
<p>Today, however, things are healing up nicely and my vision is beyond awesome. Like, as of less than twenty-four hours after operation I was seeing between 20/20 and 20/15 and it had yet to stop improving. Even with glasses I never had vision this sharp. Jeff and I went bowling last night and I was able to see every individual pin on nearly every lane in the alley (some 40 lanes); we went to Target and I could read all the aisle signs from the entrance. I&#39;m still making small discoveries that just blow me away.</p>
<p>And it all began with a less than ten minute operation. Actually, it began with my <a href="http://richardcox.net/">boss</a> mentioning and explaining it during one of our project meetings. I signed up for the free consult, made the arrangements, managed to get over my fear of having my eyes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasik#Flap_creation">slit open</a>, and here I am.</p>
<p>So, now I have super vision (which I will be paying for in monthly installments for the next several months), but totally worth it. I would do it all again in a heartbeat!</p>
<p>That aside, I shall be resuming the journal entries shortly. The last few weeks were made preparing to move apartments as my brother Jeff moved in, so we&#39;re recovering from that yet. Look forward to it!</p>
