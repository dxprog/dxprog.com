Sadly, my bros are now college students and, given the have homework and what have you, you&#39;re left with mostly just my reviews. But, there it is.</p>
<h2 id="angel-beats">Angel Beats</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_angel_beats.jpg" alt="" title="Angel Beats">
Angel Beats is a venture from many of the staff of Key, creators of Kanon, Air and Clannad. It follows the souls of a group of high school students who have died and are trapped in a sort of limbo, trying to find peace with their previous lives.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - I&#39;m a sucker for all things Key, so it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed Angel Beats. It has a good cast of characters and an interesting premise, with moments that can swing from plain ridiculous - any episode where they go to the Guild - to absolutely depressing - Yuri&#39;s back story comes to mind. The animation is top notch and the show has it&#39;s fair share of good songs, too (my favorite would be the closer, Brave Song). I look forward to an NA release. - <strong>8/10</strong>[break]</p>
<h2 id="air">Air</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_air.jpg" alt="" title="Air">
Adapted from the Key visual novel of the same name, Air follows the exploits of vagabond Yukito Kunisaki as he arrives in a town on his journey to find fabled &quot;girl in the sky.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Air kind of has a slow start. As with Clannad and Kanon, it attempts to touch on the storylines of all the girls, but a lot of it just doesn&#39;t seem to fit with what becomes the main storyline about half way through the series. Once that kicks in, though, the story becomes something rather unique and wholly interesting. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toradora!</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_toradora.jpg" alt="" title="Toradora!">
Taiga Aisaka and Ryuji Takasu are high school students who are to shy to confess their feelings to the ones they love. Seeing this commonality (and that each one of them is going after the other&#39;s best friend), Taiga and Ryuji band together to help each other pursue their object of affection.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Toradora! is probably the best new show I&#39;ve seen this year. It has a cast of fantastic characters (both main and supporting), a story that moves at just the right pace and manages to make you laugh while still tugging at the heart strings. The art style is something unique, being somewhat more angular than standard romcom fare, but is definitely top notch. Finally, all the opener and closer songs are freakin&#39; awesome! Oh, and lastly finally, it gets my award for best box set of the year. - <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kanon (2006)</strong>
<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_kanon.jpg" alt="" title="Kanon">
Kyoto Animation&#39;s adaptation of the 90s Key visual novel, Kanon. Yuichi Aizawa has just moved in with his aunt and cousin who he&#39;s not seen in ages in a town he&#39;s not visited since childhood; only problem is, he&#39;s forgotten most of that childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - Of all the girl laden anime shows I&#39;ve watched, Kanon is the only one I really consider to be a harem show, and Yuichi is a pimp daddy to be reckoned with. He bops from one girl to the next without ever looking back. This is that side effect that seems to come with translating visual novels to screen. That all said, I really enjoyed Kanon as it&#39;s just a great feel-good show that&#39;s a nice watch if you just want something mildly above fluff. - <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="strike-witches">Strike Witches</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_strike_witches.jpg" alt="" title="Strike Witches">
Strike Witches is set in an alternate reality sometime during World War II. An unknown alien force known as the Neuroi is wreaking havoc on the world and it&#39;s up to a squadron of young witches.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> - There&#39;s no other way to say this: Strike Witches is selling itself solely on fan service. Sure, all the characters fly around shooting down aircraft and are named after famed WWII fighters, but they also never wear pants and are all young girls. This show somehow manages to cram in a panty shot where you never thought a panty shot would be possible. That said, it skirts (and crosses probably) the lolicon line many, many times. The story, while certainly unique in its setting, is only mildly engaging and ultimately forgettable. - <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="gurren-lagann">Gurren Lagann</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews10_gurren_lagann.jpg" alt="" title="Gurren Lagann">
<strong>Jeff</strong> - Is there a more perfect anime than &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;? No, probably not. &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; kept hitting golden notes through every episode, from the deaths of certain characters, to the changes that happen over the duration of the story. The pace is quick and satisfying, the characters are excellent, and the symbolism is downright impressive, but it doesn&#39;t stop there. This show has managed to instill in me a permanent desire to fulfill my ambitions no matter what they may be. If it fails to do the same with you, then you are doomed to be left behind as the world moves ahead with it&#39;s drill, each revolution driving it foreward to pierce the heavens. Who the hell do you think we are!? - <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<p>So, there it is. Here&#39;s looking forward to some fantastic shows in 2011!</p>
