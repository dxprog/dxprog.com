As you can see the archives list is now sorted in descending order and I also have a little links bar (I can add as many side bars as I want too :-)). Also, fixed a few problems in the message board code and cleaned up a couple other things that had been bothering me for months.</p>
<p>I got my USBC card today which brings to to the following important note: tomorrow is bowling again. YAY! After that I&#39;ll be working three days and then get Saturday off. YAY! Then I&#39;ll work Sunday and I&#39;ll be off again. YAY! (I &#39;spect that&#39;s getting annoyiing :-P).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all I wanted to say. But before I go I&#39;ll give a shout out to my coworker buddy, Blake! :-D See ya :-)</p>
