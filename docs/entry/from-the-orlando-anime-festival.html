Sadly, it wasn&#39;t a sci-fi convention as I would have liked, but an anime convention. I don&#39;t consider myself to be an anime nerd, and even border on disliking the genre entirely, but I did have a pretty good time none the less. The convention itself was fairly small in comparison to others, but there was still a goodly amount of things going on and plenty of dealers peddling their anime related wares.</p>
<p>The atmosphere or the con was... nerdy. Even so, I felt strangely out of place as I was one of the few attendees that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> cosplaying. Most of the costumes I didn&#39;t recognize, but there were the likes of Phoenix Wright, Yuna, Link and, surprisingly, several Snakes from Metal Gear:

It still surprised me just how many girls were there. In fact, I&#39;d say the males were outnumbered by quite a bit which, for me, is an unusual situation to be in seeing as I go to school overflowing with testosterone. Just being around all these people was probably the most entertaining part of the day.</p>
<p>One of the areas we spent the most time in was the dealers floor. Just about anything anime related was being sold. Mangas, DVDs, T-shirts, action figures, plushies, costumes, weapons. And that&#39;s barely scratching the surface. As you can see in the picture above, I broke down and bought a Godot shirt. I wubs it!</p>
<p>There were some video games, including an NES championship tournament, but it was a side to everything else going on. There were rooms showing animes, people talking about how to improve your AMV/drawings, all sorts of crazy stuff. We wound up the night by sitting in on the &quot;Weakest Geek&quot; game show. It was kind of like Double Dare (sans the mess) and a quiz show with the Who Wants to be a Millionaire music playing in the background the entire time. The biggest part of this game was the &quot;Box&quot; game wherein a picture of an action figure would be shown and the player would then proceed to try to find said action figure in a fish tank filled with <em>more</em> action figures and packing peanuts. It was all rather entertaining to watch and the crew running the show was pretty cool.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to wrap this post up with a video I took while I was there (and later added music to).
