<p><strong>Finances</strong> - I spent the most money I&#39;ve ever spent this week. More on that in a moment. I have purchased all the Japanese items I shall for the month ($25 worth of light novels and manga). Bought some new shoes because every pair I had were quite literally falling apart at the seems. Also did a small Saturday project wherein I resurfaced my table... and the cleaning supplies I needed to clean said mess. This week I aim to buy nothing other than food needed to survive and gasoline if need be.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Still haven&#39;t been to either McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell, so good on that front. Only went to a couple restaurants this week, though Friday&#39;s escapades were donuts and cheese steaks, so take it as you will. Really have fallen off the walking wagon and I need to be working harder at that (can&#39;t let Mr. Helton take the top spot all the time). Yesterday, while walking to Walmart to acquire a sander, I forgot my fitbit half way there and had to turn around and try again. So my step count isn&#39;t 100% accuratly reflected.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing and Japanese</strong> - Nothing to report.</p>
<p><strong>Japan Trip</strong> - The tickets have been purchased and we&#39;re set to go the first week of June. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PyQbAA0BFs5QIqFVZ7t9rmRTyDF2qcqoa7qa4AHPVQQ/edit">We&#39;re currently penning a document of stuff we&#39;d like to do</a>. This is happening.</p>
<p>For real, dog.</p>
