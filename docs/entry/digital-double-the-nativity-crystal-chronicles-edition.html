<p>Okay, first of all I&#39;m really ticked at myself for spelling crystal wrong in the comic title. Oh, well, I&#39;m too lazy to change it now :-P.</p>
<p>The idea behind this is pretty self-explanitory. Oh, an Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is a darn fun game (not to mention probably the prettiest game I&#39;ve ever seen).</p>
<p>But that&#39;s about all I have to say about that.</p>
