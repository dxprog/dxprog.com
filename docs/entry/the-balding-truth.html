<html><head><title>The Balding Truth</title></head><body><article><h2>The Balding Truth</h2><time>June 2, 2011</time><div><p>So, I was watching a video today and the pre-roll ad was for some hair restoration product/service (don&#39;t recall which). At some point, one of the testimonials was all about how much more confidence this guy had now that he wasn&#39;t balding. And I&#39;m all like... you really rely on your hair to instill confidence? Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but I&#39;ve never understood what was so terrible about balding.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;ve always relished the thought of a receding hairline (sadly, the general consensus is that those genes passed me over). Sure, I&#39;ve always hated my hair and the fuss that must be made over it so it doesn&#39;t look stupid, but I&#39;ve always thought of bald as being both bad ass and/or dignified.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t share that mindset? Let&#39;s look at some examples:</p>

<p>This guy has made his career out of being bald...</p>

<p>...and Mr. Willis here has proven that you can still be bad ass without hair (even if you make a shitty movie based upon a complete lack of knowledge of computers).</p>
<p>My only guess as to the negative imagery would probably be people who went bald, tried to correct it and failed:</p>

<p>My answer: just shave your head and stop worrying about it. Certainly don&#39;t go basing all your confidence on its existence.</p>
<p>Now, that beer belly is something different...</p>
