<p>This is how I want to die. To be murdered by my favorite villain from my favorite game would totally make my day... as long as I&#39;m already old or something. Be sure to check out <a href="http://squareheaded.smackjeeves.com/comics/">Square Headed</a>. It updates on Thursdays, but is currently updated three days a week while in story arc mode.</p>
<p>On an interesting note, my last name is actually supposed to be pronouced &quot;Hawk-mann&quot;.</p>
