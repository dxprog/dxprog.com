Got my HDs on for this one (SD cards are freaking cheap!). Focus was still a bit of an issue and I didn&#39;t have the advantage of sunlight and I&#39;m not sure how to white balance this camera, but I like the writing better in this one. Or maybe it&#39;s worse. Being a one man video army is tough.</p>
