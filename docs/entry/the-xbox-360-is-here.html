Not only that but they would pull pillows and blankets off the shelves to lay on... and then we gave them free soda and cookies! But anyways, I was also able to see the supply before just about anybody else in the store (working so near the security cage ihas it&#39;s nice points ;-)).</p>
<p>Ah, but anyways. I did get my paycheck on Thursday. Because it only counted towards a week and a half it was $190 as opposed to the post-$200 figures I was figuring. But now I&#39;m going to be working close to 35-39 hours a week so that number should be close to doubling by next payday.</p>
<p>I also got my extra 10% Christmas discount with that paycheck. Stinky thing is it had to be used before December 4th. So I went ahead and stuffed my laptop on layaway. It has to be out by the 15th (though I may be able to get that changed) but I think that since I&#39;m working the longer hours I will be able to pay the thing off and maybe even have a little extra left.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I should wrap this up. I hope everybody out there has a good Thanksgiving! :-D</p>
