<p>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said or not, but I&#39;m currently in the middle of my two week hiatus from Wal-Mart (unpaid, sadly, but I&#39;m not one to quibble when it means two weeks of care free goodness). One of the things I vowed to do in my two weeks of freedom was teach myself how to play piano. Overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s going pretty well and having a keyboard that totally rocks helps ;-). But don&#39;t take my word for it, here&#39;s me playing a little piece of Zelda music (actually, I&#39;ve been passively working on learning this piece for over a year :-P):</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that by next summer I&#39;ll be proficient enough to play the song in its entirety (without screwing up) along with some others (Final Fantasy X&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty8PPnrKY0w">To Zanarkand</a> being of them).</p>
<p>Speaking of FFX, I am currently enjoying being beaten by the game. The story started off kind of slow (almost to the point of me deciding never to play again), but it&#39;s picked up to the point of having me completely sucked in. So I&#39;ve been playing a bit lately (excluding all my annihilations I believe my play time is somewhere around 26 hours) and hopefully I&#39;ll have beaten the stupid thing before I have to go back to work (at which point I&#39;ll start playing FFX-2).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started on a DS game. That&#39;s all I&#39;ll say because I tend to make these announcements with all sorts of grandiose promises and give up after about five minutes of coding. Yeah... it&#39;s dumb.</p>
<p>Okay, now you&#39;re all caught up for the next several months. I&#39;ll probably post something again before I go to college next fall.</p>
