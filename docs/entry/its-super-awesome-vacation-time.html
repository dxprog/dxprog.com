Unfortunately for us Full Sailors, we only get about a week of summer vacation (I get ten days because all my classes let out early). However, that&#39;s not to say I&#39;m not going to take advantage of the time off. Quite the contrary. Tomorrow I will be heading back to the good old midwest and chill with my folks. It&#39;s been over half a year since I&#39;ve seen them, so I&#39;m definitely looking forward to going back. I&#39;m especially looking forward to potato salad. Mmmmmm....</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, tomorrow is also one year from my graduation. It hardly seems like I&#39;ve been here for nine months, but there it is. It probably helps that I&#39;m usually pretty busy and that most of this is pretty fun. Though, I will admit, Flash was pretty boring. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed working on my projects, but they were small enough that I finished pretty quickly. And the last half of the course was a beginners guide to programming, something that I really don&#39;t need. So, while I did try to do more advanced things than what the project originally called for, there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of room to flex my muscles, as it were. You can check out my final project <a href="http://66.192.104.111/~mhackmann/ffm/project2">here</a>. Yes, it is an homage to <a href="http://www.egoraptor.net/">egoraptor&#39;s</a> series of awesomeness (who I had the great pleasure of helping recently). My other class this month was 3D modelling. That class was a lot of fun. The teacher was cool, the project was fun; I just enjoyed the entire class. I&#39;ll have my final project up on YouTube sometime soon.</p>
<p>In other news, I have begun and am about half way through animating a real Flash cartoon, one which will be entitled Phoenix Awesome. I hope to have it up on Newgrounds sometime over break.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about everything. I&#39;ll leave you with my MGP final project which I never actually posted on here. Enjoy</p>
