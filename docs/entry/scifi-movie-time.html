<p>Some time ago, I came to the realization that I could (for free) check out movies from the local library. As convenience would have it, the library is about half a mile from my place of work, so it provides an excellent reason to get in some exercise during my lunch break.</p>
<p>Last week - on one of these very journeys - I was perusing the blu-ray section and ran across a couple of films. One I&#39;d seen, the other not: <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>  and <em>Blade Runner</em> respectively. Now, I shouldn&#39;t have to remind you of my <a href="http://dxprog.com/comic/2000wtf/">feelings for <em>2001</em></a>, but I thought perhaps my six years of maturation since having watched it initially may have changed things. <em>Blade Runner</em> I picked up partially based on glowing reviews from a coworker, partially because I felt I was going to need some badass 80s action movie to pick me up after rewatching <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>Well, I fucked that one up.</p>
<p><em>2001</em> was watched first and, for the most part, my feelings towards the movie are mostly the same; it&#39;s slow, it doesn&#39;t make much sense, but the special effects are quite incredible for the time. About half way through the movie, I threw up my arms in defeat and got wasted. Inebriation didn&#39;t help much my enjoyment of the movie nor did it provide any epiphanies (I suspect that only getting stoned is going to help you there). But, that was okay. I knew going in about what to expect and I still had some Harrison Ford awesomeness to look forward to.</p>
<p>Only I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Because, in many ways, <em>2001</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> are very similar movies: they&#39;re both slow, they both don&#39;t make much sense, and they both have very good effects for their time. I went into <em>Blade Runner</em> expecting an action flick starring one of the best action stars of all time - something akin to Die Hard - but, instead I got a noir film set in a dystopian future that focuses on android&#39;s rights. Not what I was expecting at all.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t lie - and keeping in mind what I was expecting - I did not very much enjoy <em>Blade Runner</em>. Firstly, I&#39;m not entirely partial to dark films (both figuratively and literally in this case) and I&#39;ll give <em>2001</em> props for at least being a hopeful movie. Secondly, the soundtrack for <em>Blade Runner</em> is so 80s psychedelic that it almost made me feel like I was tripping balls despite the fact that I was entirely sober for that film. <em>2001</em>, on the other hand, uses nothing but classical music for its score, so point again. Finally, <em>Blade Runner</em>&#39;s basic premise of &quot;what are the rights of a manufactured life form&quot; has been done <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor">time</a> and <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data">again</a>. Also, while I did say it didn&#39;t make much sense, <em>Blade Runner</em> was at least a bit easier to piece together than <em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say this, I have to say that I enjoyed <em>2001</em> much more than <em>Blade Runner</em>. I don&#39;t necessarily hate <em>Blade Runner</em>, but it&#39;s just not a movie suited to my tastes.</p>
