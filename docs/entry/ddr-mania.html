Actually, it&#39;s an incredibly satisfying game once you really get going. Not only are you burning calories faster than Bill Clinton could put them on, but it&#39;s also insanely fun at the same time. Yeah... get DDR... lose weight... have fun...</p>
<p>Not sure if I&#39;ve said anything about being cashier again, but I&#39;m definitely glad I came back. I get to see all my old pals again and I get to sleep through the entire morning (not like I have :-P). However, one night they had me helping i grocery again. I was dragging palettes of frozen food taller than myself all over the place and that&#39;s scarier than any other palette dragging I&#39;ve done so far (especially when there&#39;s customers around).</p>
<p>Got my copy of New Mario Bros. last Tuesday and I&#39;ll say this: The 11 year wait for a new Mario platformer was well worth it. If feels a lot like Mario World and Mario 3 rolled together. The only gripe I have so far is that as far as I&#39;ve seen there&#39;s nothing to make Mario fly :-(.</p>
<p>And, on a side note, after today I&#39;m changing the F5 release schedule to Monday and Friday. Now that my evening is occupied by work again I don&#39;t have as much time to work on the comic.</p>
