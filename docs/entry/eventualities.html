There was no exchange of money, but many <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/lunch/">lunch battles</a> were had.</p>
<p>One of the items was a <a href="http://www.jbox.com/product/KING132">Japanese microwave potato chip maker</a>. He&#39;d never used it himself, so passed it on to me to be the brave one to try such odd novelties. I accepted his challenge to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>And then it sat in my closet for over a year.</p>
<p>That is, until today when, in a fit of super boredom, I decided that giving this thing a shot would be a good way to kill some minutes and also satiate my rumbling stomach (didn&#39;t work, wound up at Taco Bell anyways).</p>

<p>The setup is pretty easy: peel potato, slice in the slicer, arrange in the holder, nuke for around five minutes. What came out was actually pretty good. They&#39;re kind of like a cross between normal chips and potato wedges, crispy on the outside with a little bit of give inside.</p>
<p>I may actually use this thing again and experiment with seasonings. Also, hopefully I&#39;ll have larger potatoes next time.</p>
