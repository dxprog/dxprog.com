This no doubt stemmed from my dad getting me a compilation album for Christmas. Since, I&#39;ve purchased most of the albums on LP and have listened to them quite often. The aforementioned compilation set gets frequent playback in the car, which means I&#39;m listening to it a lot because the Bay&#39;s commute traffic is awful.</p>
<p>When listening to an artist so much, you start to pick up on things they like to do. One of these I noticed about Alan Parsons Project is what I&#39;m going to call &quot;setup, opposite comparator&quot; (or SOC). Over the course of a verse, a series of back-to-back comparisons (often opposites) are made. Here&#39;s a bunch of examples:</p>
<h2 id="what-goes-up-pyramid-">What goes up... (Pyramid)</h2>
<p><em>What goes up, must come down</em>
<em>What must rise, must fall</em></p>
<h2 id="gemeni-eye-in-the-sky-">Gemeni (Eye in the Sky)</h2>
<p><em>Watching, waiting</em>
<em>Rising, falling</em>
<em>Listening, calling</em>
...
<em>Touching, feeling</em>
<em>Seeing, believing</em></p>
<h2 id="psychobabble-eye-in-the-sky-">Psychobabble (Eye in the Sky)</h2>
<p><em>It ain&#39;t Kodachrome and it isn&#39;t black and white</em>
...
<em>Well, I&#39;m never on my own but there&#39;s nobody in sight</em>
...
<em>It&#39;s in Dolby stereo but I never hear it right</em>
...
<em>Well, I see the way to go but there isn&#39;t any light</em></p>
<p>and the Queen Mother of all of them is <em>You Don&#39;t Believe</em> which I won&#39;t write down, because the whole song is a series of SOCs. Check for yourself:</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed a few of these, but those were the one&#39;s off the top of my head. It&#39;s an interesting hallmark of the group for sure.</p>
