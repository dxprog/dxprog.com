Being that I actually have culinary skills, I&#39;ve made some pretty bitchin&#39; things. There was the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-letter-to-my-dearest-mother">potato salad</a>, of course, but here are some other things that have graced my table and stomach.</p>

I used to make a lot of pancakes in college (with various extras) because they&#39;re <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/detail.aspx">freakin&#39; easy</a> and cheap. Remembering that, relived the experience my first week in the apartment. Also decided to toss in some eggs and sausage because they are quite delicious. The eggs are a little dirty looking because I scrambled them in the sausage grease. Mmmmm......</p>

A couple weeks ago, I got this crazy hankering for a good salad. Just tossed around some lettuce, tomatoes and cheese along with some deli meat I had lying around (it&#39;d have gone bad soon, anyways). It was pretty awesome, but there was actually more than I could handle over the course of several days and the rest had to be tossed. Not used to cooking small quantities, am I.</p>

My supper last night. This is a dish affectionately known in my family as &quot;turkey balls&quot;. It&#39;s really nothing more than slightly browned balls of ground turkey simmered in some cream of mushroom soup and milk. I also mixed an egg and some breadcrumbs into the ground turkey. On top of rice, this is a pretty awesome meal.</p>
