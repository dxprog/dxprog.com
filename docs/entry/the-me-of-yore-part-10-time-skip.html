<p>Tenth Entry - February 18, 2001</p>
<p>Hi! Now I have to catch up on the last 1/2 year of stuff. Maggie was born on october 2. Now she is almost five months old. This week she (and Joe and Steve) have been sick. And me... I&#39;M IMMUNE. My programming has progressed a ways. I&#39;ve mastered HTML and I&#39;m going on VBScript. I have been looking at versions of VBasic on eBay. Most of VB6 go for $70 or higher. So I&#39;m thinking of making my own computer from stuff on eBay. If you are wondering how I&#39;m going to get the dough, aside from my B-Day money, I got a, get some iron straps and brace yourself, $10.60 from sales at Biblio. Also, grandma has hired me to mow her lawn this summer. But now I&#39;m getting off the subject. I have learned some DirectX for VB. My webpage is pretty snazzy. I am now doing Algebra I for school. Two or three weeks ago I made a real bow. And it actually works. Well, that&#39;s all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I recall, this is the year that I managed to skip getting sick with the rest of the family (hence the &quot;I&#39;m immune&quot; comment). Sickness in the Hackmann residence is, on the whole, a very clock-work process: twice a year, generally in early fall and late winter, the entire family gets the basic cold. Sore throat, achey body, and what I affectionately refer to as the &quot;sickness delerium&quot;. I&#39;ve skipped a sickness cycle this year as well, of which I&#39;m mildly nervous about...</p>
<p>Moving on, the money of which I spoke was from taking some books into a local home school book consignment store (Biblio). That I would make any money off that at all blew my tiny, fragile little mind and I obviously extrapolated the potential to a ridiculous degree. Though, if my fourteen year old self were to know about the ~8 cheap, thrift store computers that are sitting in my closet, he&#39;d probably shit a brick. I plan to do something grande with those computers one of these days, but today is not that day.</p>
<p>Nor is tomorrow...</p>
