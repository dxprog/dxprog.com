But now I&#39;m feeling quite chipper for two reasons: a) I&#39;m going back to cashiering again in May, b) I&#39;ve been selected to join the <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/">ACC</a> Site Improvement Committee. For anybody who&#39;s paid attention, ACPD has been one of my major ongoing projects for the last two years. Now that I am officially connected to the site I&#39;ll be able to push it more and perhaps replace their existing flash editor with <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/acpd/">ACPD Online</a>.</p>
<p>I have yet to call the DMV, however I have been driving again lately and I&#39;m not as rusty as I thought. I WILL CALL TOMORROW!!! Okay, that&#39;s out.</p>
<p>Also, I have YAVP (yet another video project) of which should actually be seeing the light of day. However, I cannot at this time divulge any information aside from that it&#39;s the most expensive project to date. I have spent eighty whole cents on props (my gosh!). I may put the trailer up here soon, but I want to try to get the entire project finished. Also, I&#39;ve been thinking of rewriting Ramboella and filming that now that I&#39;m more buff than I was six months ago. More later...</p>
<p>Finally, before I go, I need to hand out gold stars. One to devusb for properly naming the &quot;Vista blows&quot;, a play off of some lyrics in the Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie song &quot;Every OS Sucks&quot;, and one to linkman2004 for getting the &quot;winds of change quote&quot; of which was uttered by Randall in Monster&#39;s Inc. (and again sarcasticly by Mike). Congratulations and keep your eyes peeled (hint: there&#39;s one in this post). Happy hunting, and happy belated Easter :-).</p>
