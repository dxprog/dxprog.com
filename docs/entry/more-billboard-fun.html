<p>I was on another one of my afternoon walks, shooting to get in my 10,000 steps for the day, when I ran into yet another billboard that struck me an odd way. As can be seen above, it depicts Mr. Monopoly jumping out of Hell, presumably after having used his &quot;Get Out of Hell Free&quot; card. Their illegal use of the Hasbro icon notwithstanding, this brings up some interesting notions.</p>
<p>The sign insinuates that you&#39;ve already BEEN to Hell (you can&#39;t get out of something you&#39;re not in). This means that you are some sort of terrible person, probably a child molester or some one who talks at the theater. This notion of leaving Hell kind of makes &quot;eternal punishment&quot; seem a little less eternal. But, let&#39;s play by their rules and assume for a bit that Hell is indeed an escapable place so we can extrapolate further.</p>
<p>Anybody who is mildly familiar with Monopoly knows that when you land in jail there are three ways of getting out: get our of jail free card, roll doubles, or pay $50. Applying these rules to our great Hell-break scheme - as these seem to be the rules we&#39;re playing by - there are now <em>other</em> ways with which to escape eternal damnation. If you&#39;ve got some extra cash, just be sure to be buried with some tenners or, if you&#39;re not, play it like a game of chance, bring some dice and pray to God that you get doubles (remember, you get three throws). Suddenly, your chances of escaping Hell are looking pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Now that we have traversed the psychology cleverly hidden in this image, we can finally extract it&#39;s true message: Hell is for poor people.</p>
