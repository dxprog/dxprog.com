We&#39;ve just sat down and I&#39;ve paid my $5.96 for wireless internet (sucks). Our flight is scheduled to leave at 4:28 PM CDT and it is currently 2:23 PM CDT so we&#39;ve got a little bit of a wait. This flight will be taking us to Memphis, TN and then we&#39;ll have <em>another</em> two hour layover at which point I will probably be playing <strong>Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice For All</strong>. I&#39;ve already played through the first scenerio and it&#39;s freakin&#39; awesome. Kind of reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown">Encyclopedia Brown</a> (and how much I sucked at them). Seriously, though, it&#39;s a great game. I&#39;ll probably buy the first when I&#39;m done with this one.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#39;t have a plug-in here so battery life is at a premium. I may do a quick update when we get to Memphis, but I&#39;ll definitely do an update once in Orlando. Be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/sets/72157600180317876/">Flickr</a> album for pictorial updates. And, just a note, wireless internet FTW.</p>
