First of all I&#39;ve got an idea for a simple short film which I will probably be filming as soon as I finish the script. But until I can get a trailer up, you&#39;ll have to live with this poster:

I should be able to finish the script this week and start shooting next week. So keep coming back for updates.</p>
<p>Also, and this is the big news, but it looks like I may have a job pretty soon (as in an actual job). Last night I applied at Wal-Mart and I&#39;m already setup for an interview tomorrow. Now for the moment I may just have a temp job for the holidays (in the lawaway dept. of course :-P), but if I do my job well enough and with enough SpongeBob-like enthusiasm I probably have a chance of becoming a normal employee. We&#39;ll see, though. The good thing is is that I&#39;ll be making my own money pretty soon (can you spell laptop? :-D).</p>
<p>Well, it was nice to have something to post for a change (and good news at that). Just remember to keep your RSS reader up-to-date or check back for more information on... Ramboella!</p>
