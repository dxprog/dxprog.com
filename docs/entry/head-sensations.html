But, after the topic came up at lunch not long ago, I figured why not. Besides, I need to post something this month as I&#39;ve not missed posting at least one thing per month since August 2010. Gotta keep the streak alive.</p>
<p>The aforementioned topic is a physical sensation that&#39;s been dubbed on the internet as &quot;ASMR&quot;, or &quot;autonomous sensory meridian response&quot;.It&#39;s honestly a really shitty name and I thought the original idea of &quot;brain orgasm&quot; explained it better, but the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr">community</a> doesn&#39;t take kindly to that since it&#39;s not a sexual thing. To actually describe the feeling is a bit difficult as there&#39;s nothing really to relate it to. The usual description is &quot;head tingles&quot; and, while that&#39;s not entirely untrue, it doesn&#39;t seem quite accurate either. I&#39;d describe it more as a feeling of mild pressure sensation on the top and back of the scalp that will at times &quot;bloom&quot; in intensity across the scalp in response to stimuli. Yes, there are also tingles.</p>
<p>What triggers this seems to be hit and miss. Slow, steady, soft speech patterns or rustling noises can do it, so does close personal attention such as a visit to the eye doctor. The aforementioned community is a subreddit that deals in posting videos that cause this sensation for people. These generally range from creepy videos of people whispering things into a microphone to creepy videos of people making various noises with various things or sometimes role play videos that are a mix of the two. There&#39;s no getting around the creepy factor, because it is and doubly so if you don&#39;t know what the fuck is going on.</p>
<p>As for myself and my history with this... condition(?), I&#39;ve had it for as long as I can remember. I recall fairly well the first time I actually tried to vocalize it to somebody. One of my cousins and I were coloring at my grandma&#39;s house and I said something about tickles in my brain. I believe I was six or seven at the time. My young self would try to figure out ways of inducing the &quot;tingles&quot;, at one point settling on raising and lowering my eyebrows repeatedly in erratic patterns (the results were mixed).</p>
<p>As I rolled into my later teen years, I kind of forgot about whole thing except when I would go to the optometrist. It wasn&#39;t until mid-2012 when I saw an ad for the subreddit that it was brought back to my attention and a little bit of perspective put on the whole thing. Having been tuned back into the phenomenon and having a better idea of how to trigger it, I tested the waters with the creepy videos and, though it&#39;s hit and miss, they work. Now, late in the evening, I&#39;ll often put one of those videos on, lay down on my bed or the couch with my earbuds in, and take a train to Relaxation Town.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite nice, really.</p>
