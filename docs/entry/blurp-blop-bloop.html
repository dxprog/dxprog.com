Instead, here&#39;s a non-edited, slightly stoned, 100% stream of consciousness that was typed over the course of two minutes starting... NOW!</p>
<p>As I hit the enter key, &quot;Stay Alive&quot; (the last ED for Re:Zero) started playing. I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;m probably waning on favor of this song. It&#39;s a good song, no doubt, but I have a hunch I won&#39;t be listening to it in a week.</p>
<p>Speaking of a week, I came up with a hair brained scheme. In my 1:1 with my manager tomorrow, I&#39;m going to pitch the idea of working remotely in Japan for 3-6 months. I think it&#39;d effectively scratch that itch, because I do love that country so much. People talk about having home sickness, well I&#39;ve had this feeling only a couple of times:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2008 when I was in college and about to leave back for Orlando following Christmas break</li>
<li>Every single God. Damned. Time I come back from Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t know what it is about being over there that feels so right, but I want to have the opportunity to test if it&#39;s just me following the &quot;high&quot; of something new or if I really resonate with life over there that much.</p>
<p>Okay, so the timer went off while writing the above bit, but I had to finish it and added a couple of minutes. I suppose I can bullshit until it goes off...</p>
<p>Sheep are weird, right? They&#39;re both meat AND clothing. That&#39;s not weird, I suppose. Pigs and cows provide leather, after all. And that&#39;s like... a car delicacy.</p>
<p>Oh shit! The timer went off.</p>
<p>Alright, folks. Remember to drive safely and that drugs are bad, m&#39;kay.</p>
