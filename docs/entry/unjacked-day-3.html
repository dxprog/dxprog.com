[quote]So, I skipped writing anything yesterday. Slept right through it, I did. An interesting thing to note about how my sleep habits have changed: they&#39;re actually getting worse. The last two nights I&#39;ve woken in in the middle of sleeping for no apparent reason. Usually, this only happens when I&#39;m under great stress. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself stressed right now; annoyed, but not stressed.</p>
<p>In terms of reading, I am now half way through three books: The Hobbit, Oreimo, and Madoka 2. Jeff and I also rediscovered the joy of Stratego this evening even though it ended in stalemate. Four days...[/quote]</p>
