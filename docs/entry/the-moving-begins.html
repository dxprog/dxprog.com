So, I&#39;ve been going through my stuff today (nuked a few CDs :-D) and getting ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first night of bowling and a good night of bowling it was. The first two games were sort of ehhhh, but the last game was my best yet. I&#39;ll let the image speak for itself (haven&#39;t tested this Tetra feature, so it&#39;s overdue ;-)):

Yeah, 207! My dad was only 18 ahead of me at 225 (I beat him the first game :-D). If this had been last year I would&#39;ve gotten my 100 pins over average watch. Pooh :-P. </p>
<p>Well, with the moving and all, it may be a while until I can put anything up. I&#39;ll try to squeak out a little blurb before I have to pack my computer. Cheers :-)</p>
