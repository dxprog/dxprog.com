Of course, it took them this long to get me my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/3843402434/sizes/l/">diploma</a>. Now, I am usually a fairly patient person, but there is one exception to that rule: mail order. Waiting for this diploma was like ordering something from Amazon and then having to wait two years for it to get here. But, it&#39;s here now and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>Well, it would be if I had a job. I&#39;ve applied to three places now, those being <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/">ConocoPhillips</a>, <a href="http://www.griffincommunications.net/properties/businesses">Griffin New Media</a> (both web dev jobs), and a contract motion graphics job out in Florida with <a href="http://www.feldentertainment.com/">Feld Entertainment</a>. Phillips I didn&#39;t hear back from for a month and a half and at that the only contact I had was a short note saying I&#39;d been passed up. I got calls from both Griffin and Feld (on the same day even), but Feld never called back after their initial call.</p>
<p>Griffin, on the other hand, has taken an interest in me and I&#39;ve had two interviews there now (both of which went pretty well, in my opinion). The people I&#39;ve interviewed with have been extremely nice and seem to have my interests in mind as well as theirs. My first interview seemed mostly to quiz me on my web development knowledge in addition to establishing what the position I&#39;d applied for entailed. The second was more formal in terms of the questions asked and the environment in which it was conducted. Also in that interview, I had to take a skills test in which was given an hour to design and code a small contest entry page. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to finish everything on the list, though my design was good and my HTML validated first crack out of the barrel. So, at this point I&#39;m waiting to hear back from them. I&#39;m really hoping for this job because it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve been working towards the last several years and the environment and people working there are really nice.</p>
<p>Outside of job hunting, there hasn&#39;t been too much more going on in my life. So, instead of wasting precious bytes telling you how awesome the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0eNHP9rBcg">Taiko no Tasujin</a> series of games is, I&#39;ll wrap it up here.</p>
