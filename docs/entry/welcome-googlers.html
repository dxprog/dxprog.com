<p><strong>honda</strong>
They make cars. Chevy&#39;s are better.</p>
<p><strong>qualities of a cashier should possesed</strong>
Don&#39;t be a douche bag. Make sure you redline. Don&#39;t let customers walk all over you. Only you have the power to take their money. If you didn&#39;t they&#39;d be stealing. Also, try going to school and learning proper grammer. It works wonders.</p>

Is not nearly as cool as an eagle.</p>
