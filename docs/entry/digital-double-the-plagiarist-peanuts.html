<p>I am actually a fairly large fan of Peanuts (at least, pre-80s Peanuts). However, one thing that drove me insane was that Charlie Brown never stood up for himself. He allowed his life to be a constant joke to everybody and everything around him. He should&#39;ve taken Plankton&#39;s advice and asserted himself as he does here.</p>
<p>Interesting side note, there&#39;s currently a manager at Wal-Mart whose name is Charlie Brown (seriously, what were those parents thinking :-P).</p>
