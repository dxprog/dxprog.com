It&#39;s become a bad habit for sure.</p>

<p>On the left is the pile of shows I&#39;ve seen, but not from the versions I&#39;ve purchased. To be fair, the Lucky Star and Haruhi boxes were double dips; I already owned the complete series sets, but Amazon was selling the big ones for $3 (thanks for going out of business, Bandai). On the right are the shows I&#39;ve seen only partially or not at all. A bunch of it I got during RightStuf&#39;s Christmas sale last year (I&#39;m a sucker for deals).</p>

<p>Moving on to games, there are far less than the above movies/anime. Granted, this doesn&#39;t take into account my Steam collection. Still, a few items here fall into &quot;haven&#39;t completed on this particular media&quot; category, namely the Famicom games. Lego Indiana Jones I only purchased to hack my Wii U, so I doubt I&#39;ll ever play that at all.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8PTyXBgh.jpg" alt="" title="Books, check &#39;em out!"></p>
<p>You may recall some of these from my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/unjacking-from-the-matrix-an-experiment/">no internet experiment</a> last year. Well, many have gone unread and more have been added since. The Haganai book I only got a couple days ago, so perhaps that one counts less. Making matters worse, however, is the enormous stack of Japanese literature I&#39;ve acquired for that magical day when I can comprehend the language. I can <em>read</em> most of these (when there are furigana for the kanji), but I can&#39;t understand 99.97% of them. I have leafed through them all a fair amount, though, and a couple are really only art books.</p>
<p>So, it appears I have a problem pouring money into my hobbies and then not actually following up on them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this should be my new years challenge... to have done <em>before</em> 2014...</p>
