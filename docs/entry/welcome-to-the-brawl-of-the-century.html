Hah! You thought it was going to be something about Smash Bros., didn&#39;t you? Well, my friend, you were WRONG!</p>
<p>This is actually a school project. If you can name for me a college (other than mine) that tells you to rip your DVDs and then cut them together in a bizarre manor, I will give you piece of candy. This movie here is the result of about seven hours straight of work. I was up until three in the morning finishing this thing up and, many, many revisions later, I get something that&#39;s almost semi-believable. I was trying to just use Episode III Anakin so that I&#39;d have some continuity. I also needed to cull footage from a red vs blue lightsaber battle which limited me to the Dooku fight and the fight at the end of Episode V. I was hoping for some more close-up shots, but there weren&#39;t very many in either of those battles. Lucky for me the sets were fairly similar so that helped a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, enjoy.</p>
