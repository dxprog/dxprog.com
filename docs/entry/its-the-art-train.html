Okay, it&#39;s only been a few days. I did make a <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/202494/">comic</a> for Monday, though I hate it. Art&#39;s not bad, but... ugh.</p>
<p>However, this is not the reason I am posting. Nay! I&#39;ve completed what is probably my best work since my <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/55866864/">Maya</a> picture. Interestingly enough it started out as a <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/61854617/">practice sketch</a>, working on form and stuff. A few embellishments later it&#39;s a pretty cool sketch. Many hours, a few hair and grass tutorials later and it&#39;s this:

<p>One thing I&#39;ll say about it is I love the colors. It&#39;s bright and cheerful. I&#39;m really happy with it over all.</p>
