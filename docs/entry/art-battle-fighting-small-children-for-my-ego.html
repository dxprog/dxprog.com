Now that all that&#39;s out of the way, let&#39;s focus on more important things.</p>
<p>Through various happenings and goings on, two of my brothers and I challenged each other to a drawing contest of sorts. We would each choose a picture to draw and all three of us would have to draw said pictures. Over the course of three hours this afternoon we engaged in the most passive aggressive combat of all time.</p>
<p>Before I leap into the pictures themselves, a quick overview of who my challengers were. First was my 14-year-old brother Steve and second was my 11-year-old brother Joe. Was this a fair fight with me being 24? No, no it was not. Onward!</p>
<h2 id="round-1">Round 1</h2>
<p>Round 1 was Joe&#39;s choice of picture and he chose to do Mario; more particularly, he chose Tanookie statue Mario from Mario 3. A good, simple place to start, methought.</p>
<p>[gallery=Round 1 - Mario]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="The control picture."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Mario.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]
In the end, we all came pretty close to the original.</p>
<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>
<p>Steve&#39;s picture choice for round 2 was Chiyo-chan in a cat outfit. A slight bump in difficulty that seemed thoroughly appropriate.</p>

<p>This was the only round where Joe did not finish his picture first (that would be me). I think everybody did well here, catching the cuteness of the original.</p>
<h2 id="final-round">Final Round</h2>
<p>The final round was a picture of my choosing and, in keeping with the increasing difficulty trend, I chose a picture with multiple characters in it. And hands. And clothing. It&#39;s a screen from the opening of Nichijou that I&#39;d planned on drawing at some point anyways.</p>
<p>[gallery=Final Round - The Nichijou Girls]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Control_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Control sample"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Joe_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Steve_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/ArtBattle_Matt_Nichijou.jpg" alt="" title="Mine">[/gallery]</p>
<p>As can be inferred from the extra little scribblings on Joe and Steve&#39;s pages, they were not looking forward to this one as it was far more complex. Steve even gave up after drawing character number two. Still, they both are averaging a level of decency that rivals a lot of junk I see on deviantArt, so there&#39;s that.</p>
<p>In the end, Chris was the neutral party that judged all my art the best (not to brag, but I did have a ten year head start on them). However, if I do not keep my skills up they could easily surpass me. But, it&#39;s really not about winning or losing, it was just a fun time to be had and a good way to avoid packing....</p>
