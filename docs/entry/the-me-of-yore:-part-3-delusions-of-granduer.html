Before that, though, a couple of birthday shout outs. Firstly, to my mom who turns old today (again). Second is to me, or rather dxprog. It was ten years ago that I chose the online moniker that I still use today. But, enough of that. Journal stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifth Entry
July 29, 1999</p>
<p>Well, I got my goggles today. They&#39;re neat. The lenses are yellow. But I didn&#39;t get to test them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because that was short, here&#39;s one more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sixth Entry
August 6, 1999</p>
<p>The greatly anticipated moment has come and gone. WE&#39;VE SEEN THE PHANTOM MENACE!! It was awesome! I&#39;ve taken Jeff up as my Padawan Apprentice. He&#39;s excited. I&#39;ve also tackled something new in T-Attack... x6 and x5! We went swimming again on Tuesday. I did a flip perfectly and NO ONE WAS WATCHING!!! So I kept trying. I was going to show mom after doing several 1 1/2 flips and the DAMN WHISTLE BLEW. My foots healed. A few days ago I got my first zit. So we got some zit cream. Got another letter from my pen pal. Still need to send my letter. Tomorrow my bros and I are secretly going to make breakfast. I made a kite last Sunday. Don&#39;t know if it flys yet though. I also did B-Day shopping for Stevie with mom. Time to wrap it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much to say here, though it&#39;s funny how one&#39;s opinions of a movie can change in thirteen years. I don&#39;t hate Episode I, but I certainly do not think it&#39;s &quot;awesome&quot; anymore. That said, I can understand being excited for it as a kid.</p>
<p>Also, making public of dark secrets that I would rather have remained in the dark depths of hell: the &quot;Padawan Apprentice&quot; bit. Somewhere between thirteen and sixteen, I was really into Star Wars. Like, <em>really</em> into it. Enough so that I tried to delude myself and my brothers into thinking that I had originated from that galaxy far, far away and was reincarnated here or some shit. Call it hardcore pretend or something.</p>
<p>I had issues. But I&#39;m okay now...</p>
