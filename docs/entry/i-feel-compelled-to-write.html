Lucky me has class six days a week! (except next week where I only have class four days. Whatever.) So, you&#39;re probably asking &quot;Hey, Matt! What kind of awesome stuff do you get to do this month?&quot; To which I answer &quot;Have you not been paying attention, compadre? Classes aren&#39;t fun anymore.&quot; This month is the exciting world of portfolio creation and business communication (see this, here, now? I&#39;m communicating. Perhaps to businesses).</p>
<p>But, school aside, I&#39;ve been having a rather fun time rewriting the interface to that <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/building-a-web-based-media-player---part-1">media player</a> I brought up some months back. This time, however, the entire front end is all ajaxy and delicious. Don&#39;t believe me? <a href="http://dxprog.dyndns.org/Music">Check it out</a> for yourself, but don&#39;t be ripping off my songs, hear? Though, you&#39;d have to get a flash decompiler or something to actually find where they are on my server. It&#39;s all very exciting.</p>
<p>In some days (by which I mean tomorrow) I will the happy owner of a brand new Wii Fit (only cost me twenty extra over retail). Since I left Wal-Mart I&#39;ve put on some weight - about thirty pounds. Feeling more like a pregnant lady in her third month than the macho man I am, I felt it was time to do something about that. So, I might do a weekly update thingy here as that progresses, though we all know what happens when I promise regular updates of some sort.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I like to google myself and my friends, probably because I have far too much time on my hands. It&#39;s an interesting thing to do and one I recommend to my peers (by which I mean other internet micro-celebrities). Interestingly, I seem to have the most web presence of the classmates I googled. Granted, I have had a little bit of a <a href="http://youngprogrammers.net">head start</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvOAW-KZqCo#t=8m24s">bump</a> here and there. I suppose it isn&#39;t the most common thing ever to be featured on the front page of various gaming sites (twice), but surly somebody in that class has done <em>something</em> that&#39;s caught the attention of the internet. Then again, I do seem to be <em>that guy</em> as devusb so fervently calls it, and unfortunately I have to agree. That&#39;s probably why I still spend most of my time alone with my computer while everybody else is out smoking weed and getting laid. Or perhaps the internet fame happens because I stay at home by myself. But, we&#39;re not here to get into the chicken/egg debate. Actually why don&#39;t we.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Chicken or the egg. Which came first?
<strong>A:</strong> Who cares, they&#39;re both delicious.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that&#39;s enough nonsense for one afternoon. Besides, I have other equally unimportant things I could be doing, like checking digg/Joystiq/Engadget, stalking people on Facebook/Twitter, binge drinking all my troubles away, the usual.</p>
