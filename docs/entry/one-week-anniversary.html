I&#39;ve done probably about everything, now, and seen just about everything put on layaway (except groceries). I&#39;m not sure what my standing is now, but I was already getting high praise on Monday (can&#39;t let it get to my head). Also, yesterday, the other layaway boy had his first day and I showed him the ropes. He&#39;ll be mainly working when I&#39;m not. Just some interesting stats that I&#39;ll be updating regularly. To date I&#39;ve boxed/binned the following:
4 GameCubes
1 GameBoy Advance SP
2 Xboxs
2 PlayStation 2s
1 Laptop</p>
<p>Quite fun, eh? Also, at the request of SeniorUSB, here is a picture of me in my &quot;little vest&quot;:

<p>One day after work I went to the electronics dept. to take a look at their laptops because apparently I&#39;ll get an extra 10% cupon for Christmas bonus. I didn&#39;t really expect to find anything aside from budget systems, but I found <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4228534">this</a>. With the exception of hard drive space it is more powerful than my desktop (which will become a file/web server). A feature I thought was kind of interesting was the fact that it can play DVD/CDs without even booting into Windows (save on battery life I&#39;m sure). But it will be nice to have a portable computing solution, not to mention just downright cool :-).</p>
<p>In programming land, I&#39;m currently working on trying to write an NES emulator. This is pretty much just for the learning experience to help understand the behind the scene ops of computers/game consoles. I hope that by learning that stuff I&#39;ll have a better understanding of current systems (GBA, GCN, etc.) and thus develop for them with little or no learning curve. I&#39;ve found a bunch of handy info at <a href="http://parodius.nesdev.com">NesDev.com</a> which is helping quite a bit and I more or less understand how the whole internal system works, but figuring how you load things in from ROM sill escapes me. Hopefully this time next week I&#39;ll have my mock 6502 running a few opcodes. I&#39;m mainly trying to get the thing to the point that I can run the original Mario Bros. which is fairly basic but it&#39;ll be a mighty cool feeling, I&#39;ll tell you now :-).</p>
