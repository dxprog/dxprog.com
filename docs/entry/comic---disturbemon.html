<p>Haven&#39;t made one of these in a while. I was digging through some of my old stuff the other day and found my little comic ideas notebook. I always did like this one and I&#39;m not sure why I never made it. This and <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54176/">Pikachunks</a> were actually written at the same time and were supposed to &quot;air&quot; back to back. But, anyhoo...</p>
<p>Since I can&#39;t use Photoshop anymore and since GIMP sucks I had to ink the comic by hand. BY HAND! Actually, it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Not to say that it is without problems but it works.</p>
