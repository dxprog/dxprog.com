I&#39;ve consumed quite a lot of media this year, from my newfound addiction to anime and the usual domestic shows and video games. Over the next couple of weeks, I&#39;m going to review what I considered to be the best of the best in each genre. Today, I&#39;ll start off with movies. I&#39;m going to fudge a little bit and include movies released last year as well, otherwise this would be a really short list.</p>
<h2 id="the-incredible-hulk-2008-">The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_incredible_hulk.jpg" alt="" title="The Incredible Hulk">
Honestly, I just watched this movie for the first time tonight. I will preface by saying that I really didn&#39;t have any issues with the 2003 film and saw the reboot of a reboot so close together a little ridiculous. However, that aside, the new film was enjoyable. I didn&#39;t love this film, nor did I hate it. It&#39;s pretty much the basic tale of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk and how he attempted to cope with it. There&#39;s plenty of action to go along with the story and everything flows well. One thing I will pick on, however, was how bad the CGI in this film was. At times I felt like I was watching something that had been rendered with the UT3 engine and there was even a scene where the green screen keying failed to suspend my disbelief. <strong>7/10 </strong></p>
<h2 id="iron-man-2008-">Iron Man (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_iron_man.jpg" alt="" title="Iron Man">
The second super hero movie on this list. Unlike <em>Hulk</em>, though, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing film. Again, it&#39;s another origins tale detailing how weapons designer and super genius Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and his adventures as such. What really makes this movie work so well is Stark and how he is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. His playboy asshole persona is enough to make you say &quot;what a dick&quot; and yet still be completely likeable. Some criticize this movie for its lack of action, but this was never a problem for me. We see plenty of Iron Man flying around and blowing things up, but it&#39;s the character development that really shines. The only negative to this movie is the lack of a really strong antagonist. Finally, if you buy the DVD, splurge on the special edition version as it has some really good documentaries (best I&#39;ve seen since Star Wars II). <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="wall-e-2008-">Wall-E (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_wall_e.jpg" alt="" title="Wall-E">
Andrew Stanton once again takes the helm of the Pixar engine after a three movie reprieve since <em>Finding Nemo</em> to deliver another wholly wonderful experience worthy of both the Pixar name and his reputation. I think Ben Burtt, sound designer for both this film and, more notably, the <em>Star Wars</em> films, accurately described <em>Wall-E</em> as &quot;R2 the Movie&quot;. It follows the story of one garbage robot, Wall-E, as he is whisked away from a garbage-apocalyptic Earth and finds love and adventure amongst the stars. To pull off a film in which none of the main protagonists really talk, and do it so well, is a testament to both Stanton and Burtt&#39;s abilities. Everything about this film just oozes cute and feel good, but it&#39;s the first twenty or so minutes that really shine, both from a story telling standpoint but most especially from the art direction. The desolation of Earth is sold so well and the score underlines the mood perfectly. There is the environmental subtext, but I never found it so prominent as to be off-putting. <em>Wall-E</em> ties for first with Nemo as my favorite Pixar film of all time. <strong>10/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="kung-fu-panda-2008-">Kung Fu Panda (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_kung_fu_panda.jpg" alt="" title="Kung Fu Panda">
I was expecting <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> to be a huge pile of crap. After having seen the trailers on TV time and again, I hated this movie before it had even hit theaters. After some prodding by friends, I grudgingly went to see it and thank heavens I did. There is so much to love about KFP. It&#39;s the story of a nredy, fat, noodle-making panda - Po - who is chosen to as the prophesied &quot;dragon warrior&quot; that will rid the world of the evil Tai Lung. The story and humor are excellent, the visuals and art direction are stunning and, for a kids movie, it has a lot of superbly executed action pieces. The opening sets the mood for the film so well and Jack Black does a spectacular job voicing Po, adding just enough of his personality to the character without overdoing it. There are plenty of genuinely humorous moments in the film and amazingly never resorts to fart jokes. Finally, the score is absolutely fantastic with many Asian motifs playing through and setting the tone for the film quite excellently. This is the first CG animated film that I would dare to put on par with any Pixar fare and it does so with flying colors. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="wanted-2008-">Wanted (2008)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_wanted.jpg" alt="" title="Wanted">
This was another film that I was talked into seeing. Sadly, it&#39;s largely forgettable. The plot is so bizarre that I was never really sold on it and thus tainted the rest of the experience. A machine weaving binary messages into cloth? Please. The MythBusters episode where they tackled the curving bullets - one of the major elements to this film - was more entertaining. However, this is meant to be simply an action flick and I suppose it passes as that. <em>Die Hard</em> it is not, though. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="star-trek-2009-">Star Trek (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_star_trek.jpg" alt="" title="Star Trek">
SPOILERS AHEAD, YE BE WARNED. This was one of two films that I was really looking forward to seeing this year and honestly the only one that I was really hyped about. I even went to see it on opening weekend, the only other film to have that honor was Revenge of the Sith. What I received was, in my opinion, an enjoyable action flick but a poor <em>Trek</em> movie. The way that Abrams (whom I will address in just a moment) decided to rewrite the story was fine in theory, but came off as wholly unbelievable. Why would the cataclysmic battle at the beginning of the film so drastically change things in the design world (I.e. ship design, interfaces, etc)? How is it even possible that those characters would wind up in the same positions on the same ship as in the previous timeline? And what was with Uhura&#39;s random spontaneous thing for Spock? I was waiting for the reset button to be pressed at the end of the movie, but was depressed when there was none. Star Trek has never been entirely action oriented opting instead for more situationally based, cerebral stories. However, what we got in this was another over CGed affair with more eye candy than brain food. And, while I&#39;m on the subject, a direct message to Mr. Abrams:
They invented the tripod for a reason. It&#39;s so the camera isn&#39;t shaky. My vision is blurry enough without you giving camera control to Michael J. Fox (no offense, Mr. Fox). And all that lens flare and bloom? This isn&#39;t the 90&#39;s. They aren&#39;t cool, they don&#39;t add anything, so stop using them.
While being critically acclaimed, I do not believe that this film holds a candle to most of the even-numbered films in the series and place it on par with Nemesis (my least favorite). If you want a really good TOS <em>Star Trek</em> movie, my pick would be <em>Undiscovered Country</em>. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="up-2009-">Up (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_up.jpg" alt="" title="Up">
Much like <em>Cars</em>, the premise for _Up_ had me worried. The trailer only mildly interested me at best (though it looked great in 3D). Sadly, unlike <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>, it didn&#39;t do anything to sway my opinion in the other direction. The story follows an old man who attaches a crap ton of balloons to his house and flies to South America. While the opening few minutes of the movie are probably some of the best cinema has ever seen, the story that follows is simply to bizarre and disjointed. I didn&#39;t really find myself attached to any of the characters&#39; plights or that I even cared for them much. However, that said, this movie does offer up quite a bit in terms of comedy, especially through the character of Dug. There&#39;s really not much else to say about the film except maybe that Michael Giacchino&#39;s score was well-suited and enjoyable. This ranks second to last on my Pixar list, right about <em>Cars</em>. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<h2 id="coraline-2009-">Coraline (2009)</h2>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/reviews09_coraline.jpg" alt="" title="Coralina">
Here&#39;s a deceptive one. &quot;From the director of Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was what they touted in the trailers and spots, knowing that most people think Tim Burton directed said movie. Well, he didn&#39;t and he had no involvement on this film (thank God). Based on the popular children&#39;s novel of the same name, <em>Coraline</em> is a thoroughly wonderful and enjoyable film. Coraline Jones finds herself in a new and strage house with a room containing a small doorway leading to many a fantastical adventure. It is unique but at the same time twisted and I believe that the way they translated the book to the screen worked very well (despite taking some liberties). What really shines in <em>Coraline</em>, though, is the animation. Stop motion is certainly not very favorable these days, what with CG being much faster and cheaper. However, what they&#39;ve pulled off in this movie is absolutely stunning and even more so when you watch it in 3D (like I was able to in the theater). I personally will be rooting this film for Best Animated Picture when Oscar season rolls around. <strong>9/10</strong>
If I had to choose which of these films I believe was best, I think the award would go to <em>Iron Man</em>. Everything about it is just so enjoyable and watching Downey Jr&#39;s performance is an absolute treat, something you don&#39;t see in cinema too often anymore.
Check back in a few days when I review video games from the last two years.</p>
