Two gin and tonics is enough to get me a little loopy, apparently. But, that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here.</p>
<p>Last week, as I was biking home from work, I had a bit of a realization; for the last ten year, approximately every two years, my life hits some sort of major stepping stone. Stay with me a moment as we saunter down this alley.</p>
<h2 id="2003">2003</h2>
<p>Probably one of the smaller items on this list, I became an admin of the YPN in late &#39;02/early &#39;03. This saw a very large uptick in my time spent doing web development. From YPNgine to Tetra, it occupied quite a lot of time and is certainly integral to where I am today.</p>
<h2 id="2005">2005</h2>
<p>In November of &#39;05, I got my very first job as a layaway runner at Walmart. I almost consider this as the beginning of my modern life and certainly influential in the being I&#39;ve become; learning the way of the world and coming out of the introverted shell I had adopted through most of my teenage years.</p>
<h2 id="2007">2007</h2>
<p>October of 2007 saw me leaving the comforts of the Midwest for the first time and beginning my college life in the far reaches of Orlando Florida. A lot of my rougher edges in terms of design and development were sanded down while there for sure, though I&#39;ve since made strides to drop the moniker of designer. Certainly I grew socially while there, but still didn&#39;t live the typical college student life. Also, it was during this time that I developed my interest in anime, for good or ill.</p>
<h2 id="2009">2009</h2>
<p>Having graduated from college, I began my life in the professional world (late &#39;09, but &#39;09 it was). These times were absolutely influential to myself as a front end web developer, owing quite a lot to my fellow coworkers (the Frenchie in particular). It was certainly a trial by fire as I learned how the corporate world operates and how to most effectively make one&#39;s way within it, though I&#39;m certainly still learning on that part.</p>
<h2 id="2011">2011</h2>
<p>This year was big for two reasons: I finally learned my true worth as a developer and I finally began life outside of the domain of my parents&#39; household. Certainly, the latter is a major milestone for any individual, but I guess little else happened that year outside of beginning to realize how I could push the boundaries of being one&#39;s own keeper... like late night Taco Bell runs :)</p>
<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>
<p>This all leads into this year where I find myself permanently moved to a foreign part of the nation and working at a major company in the internet sector. It feels normal and yet surreal at the same time. Through all the previous years, I always had this nagging feeling that I was waiting for something, the kind of feeling of anticipation that you have around Christmas but less so. I could never put my finger on what it was I was waiting for, but that feeling has nearly vanished since I&#39;ve been here. Where I had cognitively resigned to working at a news station for the rest of my life, my gut had other plans and is now satisfied with the position I find myself in. Of course, there&#39;s still</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>Given the above as a foundation, considering major life events happen every two years, let&#39;s consider extrapolating this out into how I&#39;d like things to pan out.</p>
<p><strong>2015</strong>
Despite never having worked at any establishment for two years straight, I&#39;ll still be at LinkedIn and now an &quot;old-timer&quot;. More importantly than that, I&#39;ll be &quot;going steady&quot; with a very nice girl. Now, I would prefer that this actually happen before the two year marker much like the later items on this list.</p>
<p><strong>2017</strong>
By this time, with any luck I will be married or engaged to the aforementioned &quot;nice girl&quot;. Now, four years is a fairly small time span to find &quot;the one&quot; or a person coming close to, but I&#39;ve witnessed this happen first hand and it&#39;s certainly not out of the realm of possibility. Of course, if I continue to sit on my hands waiting for Mrs. Hackmann to waltz into my life, it becomes slightly more muddled...</p>
<p><strong>2019</strong>
In a word, fatherhood. The last two or three years I&#39;ve been feeling the pangs of wanting to have kids. A daughter to dote on and/or a son with whom I can show the wonders of nerddom (actually, all of that can apply to both). Either way, children with whom I can share the wonder and magic of the world that we live in.</p>
<p>The next six years should be interesting for sure and, if the past has shown me anything, will bring with it absolutely nothing that I imagined it would.</p>
