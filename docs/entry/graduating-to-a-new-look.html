I&#39;m sure I say it every time I do this, but this iteration is by far the most advanced version of the site to date. I can pretty much wrap up all the updates in a nutshell by saying I&#39;ve had a lot of fun throwing in all sorts of jQuery and Ajaxy stuff, but I&#39;ll itemize.</p>
<p>The front page, for starters, shows the latest and greatest projects and blog posts on the site in the featured pane. The gallery has undergone a huge overhaul and is much more intuitive than it was before. I&#39;ve also uploaded quite a lot of new content to the gallery page, so go take a gander at that to see what awesome stuff I&#39;ve been up to. And finally, even the contact is looking spiffier with a picture of yours truly and a link to all the social media outlets I&#39;m currently signed up for.</p>
<p>With the new design out of the way, I&#39;ll shift focus to the new {mh}labs; section of the website, where you&#39;ll be able to find all sorts of little pojects that have never been released to the general public (and some that have).</p>
<p>The future is bright at dxprog.com, so be sure to bookmark us and return often for all sorts of goody goodness.</p>
