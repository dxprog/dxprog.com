<p>Ha! Now there&#39;s a title!</p>
<p>This year my bros and I will be attending <a href="http://www.tokyointulsa.com/">Tokyo in Tulsa</a> - a local anime convention - much as we did last year. However, this year not only will we be splurging on all three days, but we&#39;ll be shedding all our inhibitions and cosplaying. Well, at the very least I will. This is my fourth con, after all.</p>
<p>In addition to the costume getup itself, I am using this as an excuse to get my sorry ass into better shape. Since I&#39;ve started my new job, I&#39;ve been spending most of my lunch breaks climbing the stairs to the top of the building, about seventeen floors. In addition, lately I have also been walking around the small park adjacent to the building after said stair climbing (about a third of a mile or so).</p>
<p>Now, however, I will be stepping it up even more. My apartment has a pretty decent exercise facility and I plan to take advantage of it. So, tonight when everybody else has gone to sleep, I and my iPhone will make a trip across to the office and I will hit the treadmills.</p>
<p>My goal is that in the month and a half until the con, I can lose <em>some</em> of the fat roll and maybe even bring myself under 200 again. Honestly, that last part wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch - couple pounds a week, really.</p>
<p>So shall it be written, so shall it be done!</p>
