However, instead of doing a complete redesign I&#39;ve decided to just improve the functionality. First off, you&#39;ll notice that the main content stuff is much wider now. Very tasty. Even tastier than that, though, is how the side bars are now organized. Using the awesomeness of <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> I am able to conveniently place everything in one column without sacrificing functionality or cluttering stuff up. Well, there it is.</p>
