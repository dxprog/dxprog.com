So good to be back at my computer with a real keyboard and a copy of Photoshop with which to make stupid blog headers.</p>
<p>So, in my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/ipadly-thing">previous post</a>, I mentioned a particular game called SeaGlass. It is, or at least attempts to be, a Tetris Attack type clone. It&#39;s obvious that there was no love or effort put into this game and, being my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/welcome_to_the_week_of_top_5/">favorite game of all time</a>, it makes me sad inside.</p>
<p>I simply cannot stand for this.</p>
<p>So, as I am already in a heated battle with my much maligned <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/linkman2004">younger brother</a> developing just such a game, I will scrap the XNA codebase I&#39;ve spent some evenings working on and move over to the iOS platform for development. Using the <a href="http://www.airplaysdk.com/">Airplay SDK</a>, I will create a game for the App Store that is a truly worthy entry to the game series it plays homage to.</p>
<p>That and I can charge 99 cents and make a tiny profit. Really, this is me testing the mobile development world with an application I am already <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/">quite familiar with</a>. I&#39;ve been wanting to break into the arena for some time and this is where it begins.</p>
