I&#39;m currently being considered for a job at Gamespot/TV.com/MP3.com doing web work for them. Now that in itself is cool but it would mean relocating to San Fransico (a good several hundred miles from here). It&#39;s kind of an exciting thought, though. Finally making my own money, putting aside worries of my future at least for the time being.</p>
<p>In other news, I&#39;m getting the parish site up to speed again (basically the last job that really needs to be done) and I&#39;m going to rewrite my GBA bowling program. I&#39;ve been trying to think of a game to write, but it hasn&#39;t been coming lately. Oh well.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been having some nasty hankering to play old Mario World again (probably thanks to my last write up). So, after collecting some money from VB.NET, I bought it for my beloved GBA :-). Of course, you can&#39;t have Mario World 1 without Mario World 2 (aka Yoshi&#39;s Island) so I got it too :-). Now my game collection should be complete (though Mario Kart would be fun and the Wario Ware games look like a blast :-D).</p>
<p>And, this just in, we finally found a AC adapter for the old keyboard and now I can start teaching myself how to play :-).</p>
<p>Well, I shall sign off for the night. Maybe next time I&#39;ll put up my next autobiographical installment.</p>
