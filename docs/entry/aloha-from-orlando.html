I&#39;m about 10-15 minutes from Universal, and hopefully, not too far from the school. I was going to do a blog update in Memphis but their WiFi was broken. Kind of funny because they were advertising it to the nines.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now flown on two planes and I can say I&#39;d rather be in the cockpit. I have a phopia of needing to see where I&#39;m going and it drives me nuts to just be able to see out the side. Also, night flying in storms is... interesting. Coming in over Orlando was quite impressive. In fact it looked a little like <a href="http://coruscant.info/Globecoruscant.jpg">this</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m dead tired. As always check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog">Flickr</a> page.</p>
