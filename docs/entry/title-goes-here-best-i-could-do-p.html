<p>Firstly, my Empire game is coming along nicely. I spent most of the afternoon and part of this evening getting the random map generation working. That was a blast :-D. Tomorrow I will actually start building the engine framework. This is the part where I generally choke, but I feel pretty motivated :-). I&#39;ve never really done anything to this degree (and this clean) in C++.</p>
<p>Secondly, I got to evict a wasp nest hanging up in one of the windows. It was kind of cool (and scary). Luckily, we&#39;ve got some nasty spray that kills on contact. A couple of spritzes upwards and it started raining wasps. One tried to retaliate, but then it died ;-).</p>
<p>Thirdly, somebody is coming to see the house tomorrow morning (day 6 on the market, about day 4 for actually having the sign up). So that means more cleaning and evacuation and since school starts locally tomorrow we&#39;re going to be the odd ones out. Figures :-P. But, all in all, I don&#39;t really mind. The more people who look at the house the greater our odds of selling the thing.</p>
<p>It kind of bums me out that Twilight Princess isn&#39;t coming out until next year, but that gives me more time to come up with money ;-). Actually, I seem to have found a direction for me to go. Sometime this year I&#39;ll take the GED and then just spend from then until fall of next year, when I&#39;ll go to a local college to get ready for DigiPen, on a job and saving money. It&#39;s the clearest direction on where to take life I&#39;ve had in a long time.</p>
<p>Well, that was kind of long winded for a change :-P. Before I leave, however, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to Slazer for reading my blog. You&#39;re a cool dude, Slazer ;-). See ya!</p>
