<p>One day, somewhere between Christmas and New Years, a coworker of mine was musing out loud about a vanity reddit account he had created. He was describing exactly what it would do and I was like &quot;dude. We can automate that.&quot; So, in a fury of coding and some poring over reddit documentation, I pulled together a very simple bot that did exactly what he had described. Slapped it on an every ten minutes cron job and called it a day. The code was ugly and I vowed to make a nicer version.</p>
<p>That I did and, while I was at it, decided that I should make it a simple framework with which I could bots in a simple manner and have a central script that managed them all. The above source is what I settled on (complete with a working, if not banned, version of a binky79 clone).</p>
<p>My own bot idea, as it was Christmas, was for a bot named Ebeneezer_McUpvote (a portmanteau of Ebenezer Scrooge, Scrooge McDuck and everyone&#39;s favorite reddit term, upvote) to randomly upvote a new link and add the comment &quot;Merry Christmas! Have an upvote ^ _ Q&quot;. Scripted, running, would execute every five minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Ebeneezer_McUpvote">People hate it.</a></p>
<p>As of this writing, that bot has -310 comment karma. Now here&#39;s where the fickleness of reddit shows through.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as I was browsing, I came upon <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ogjx1/its_439pm_saturday_in_australia_i_am_drunkthis_is/">this post</a>. So, Oprah giving random upvotes is considered cool, eh?</p>
<p>Enter, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/OprahGivesAnUpvote">OprahGivesAnUpvote</a>. She does pretty much EXACTLY the same thing as Ebeneezer_McUpvote, only she says &quot;Look under your chair... you got an UPVOOOOOOOOTE!!&quot;. People love her. OprahGivesAnUpvote has, at this writing, 233 comment karma and she&#39;s only been running since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Why the hatred? I dunno. Maybe people don&#39;t get the joke of Ebeneezer_McUpvote. Maybe the joke just sucks. Maybe it&#39;s not Christmas anymore. Either way, Oprah is loved, McUpvote is not. I&#39;ll be interested to see if Ebeneezer&#39;s fortune turns around when we get closer to Christmas again...</p>
