<p>Well I have now been sixteen for twenty-four hours. Nothing special. We went to Mass as usual. Afterward we went to Gardener&#39;s and looked around a while. I found an HTML book for Chris. Mom found an old Catholic text book for a buck. We came home to some stew Dad cooked up. It was really good. After that I played some Dr. Mario. Then I worked up an ASP program to hold my financial stuff. Then we went to bed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, there is something to be mentioned here. Gardners, erroneously spelled above, is a local used bookstore. Back in my youth, it was a great place to ogle over almost irrelevant programming books (most of which are actually still at the store today). Nowadays, I ignore the computer section entirely and mostly peruse the manga section ($5 tankoban is a pretty good deal).</p>

<p>An amazing this happened today. I completed every subject in school! I also finished my Mockingbird synopsis. Amazery! And on top of all that, I made it through level twenty of Dr. Mario. I also chatted with &quot;kpyro&quot; on AOL. So over today  was really good.[/quote]</p>
<p>kypyro was one of the first and only people I ever talked with off the YPN boards and at that it was very brief. I don&#39;t recall why, but I came to distrust him at one point. The only actual person I chat with from those days anymore hadn&#39;t even joined YPN at that point.</p>
