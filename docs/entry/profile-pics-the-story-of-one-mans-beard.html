This is something I do, on average, every 6-8 months or more (I didn&#39;t really bother to calculate the actual average). Looking through my past profile pics on Facebook, I noticed something interesting: they convey a visual history of my beard. My beard is certainly deserving of its own blog post, so I will regale its tale here for the masses!</p>

<strong>April 2007</strong> - A couple of straggling hairs, but otherwise nothing. My hand does not deserve to be stroking a smooth chin.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007b.jpg" alt="" title="Circa May 2007">
<strong>May 2007</strong> - At this point, there&#39;s enough hairs that I could probably have cosplayed as <a href="http://aceattorney.wikia.com/wiki/Gumshoe">Detective Gumshoe</a> quite easily.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2007c.jpg" alt="" title="Circa October 2007">
<strong>October 2007</strong> - Okay, let&#39;s face it. 2007 was a crappy year for the beard.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2008.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2008">
<strong>October 2008</strong> - While certainly not filled out, the beard was finally showing some promise of being EPIC. Interesting side note - I had to Photoshop that smirk onto my face</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2009.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2009">
<strong>May 2009</strong> - Two years later, the beard is finally respectable enough that it can be stroked in deep thought and look awesome.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/Beard_2010.jpg" alt="" title="Circa 2010">
<strong>October 2010</strong> - After 24 years of beard growing, I think it&#39;s finally gotten to the &quot;You don&#39;t want to fuck with me&quot; status. The shades help.</p>
<p>Some other interesting things to notice in these pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>My face is almost always pointed away from the camera</li>
<li>I get fatter as time goes on</li>
</ul>
