So, I&#39;m going to kick in another post-a-day type experiment... starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m going to do is keep a daily log for a week, but instead of my usual type rambling, it&#39;ll be just 100% facts, completely devoid of emotion, opinion, or adjectives/adverbs (using as few as possible). A little something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I woke up at 10:15am this morning. I didn&#39;t actually want to leave my bed, so I fished my iPad out from under my bed and checked my email, Facebook, and reddit. I decided to make German potato salad today but lacked all the ingredients required. After deliberation, I decided I would bike. I geared up, but after getting out the door noticed that my back tire was again low. I put the bike back in my apartment and took the car instead. Since I was no longer worried about distance or the roads I would need to take, I went to Safeway because they have a better selection of food than Target. Once at the store, I purchased potatoes, scallions, bacon, and white wine vinegar. After returning home, I cleaned a large pot to boil the potatoes in. They are currently boiling now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a bit like those old <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/the-me-of-yore-part-1/">journal entries of mine, no?</a>. For contrast, here&#39;s how I&#39;d rewrite the first couple of sentences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that I&#39;m only half way into this day, I would label it as almost entirely ordinary. Consciousness began to return to me somewhere around 10:15a, about an hour later than my usual 9a (largely thankful to my late night of playing Danganronpa, no doubt). Despite the lateness, I didn&#39;t feel like leave the warm comforts of my bed, so I grabbed my iPad (generally kept beneath my bed) to entertain myself with. I did a quick check of my email, Facebook, and skimmed reddit. Despite Alien Blue being a pretty nice app, I don&#39;t like to &quot;deep dive&quot; into my usual subreddits on a mobile device because I feel the experience would be diminished on a small screen (moe must be observed with as many pixels as possible).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, yeah. That&#39;s a thing I&#39;m going to do because I&#39;m otherwise bored and have little to write about (or am not willing to expend the effort in doing so).</p>
