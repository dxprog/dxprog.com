<p>All things considered, I could still &quot;win&quot; this thing if I missed a day. But, who said this was a contest? It&#39;s more of a &quot;this is a thing we want to do, let&#39;s draw strength and encouragement from each other&quot;. Kinda like a diet buddy, but with words instead.</p>
<p>I&#39;m forced to wonder, however: what exactly am I getting out of this? Sure, for the past year or so I&#39;ve wanted to write about serious topics that weigh on my mind. But, instead of actually trying to put that stuff to words, I&#39;m bullshitting a paragraph of text. The weird thing is, as I&#39;m typing this, I know that all this rambling will come off like some disturbed and emo teenager on LiveJournal in the mid-00s.</p>
<p>I was just telling my mom this evening that I write this blog for me. So, given that, why should I care what words I lay down? I&#39;m me and I understand the context within all this is written. Of course, come next year I&#39;ll have lost that and be just another outsider looking in with only a vague recollection of the times my current self was going through. But, even given that, it&#39;s still me so why should I worry?</p>
<p>Aha!</p>
<p>Despite this notion of writing for my future self, I&#39;m fully aware of the publicness of these ramblings. Any Joe Schmoe (or people I know and know read this blog) can and will happen upon this post. If they&#39;ve made it this far, they&#39;re wondering &quot;okay... just how crazy _is_ Matt?&quot; And I&#39;m aware of all this.</p>
<p>As I continue to type.</p>
<p>Fully knowing that eyebrows will be raised. Raised in a curious pondering, perhaps a tinged with a little worry.</p>
