Yes, I&#39;ve teased you all long enough. Feast your eyes on the 100% sexiness below:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_matt.jpg" alt="" title="DE GESO!"></p>
<p>It&#39;s a male variant of <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XED8rrt6EgU/TfS0zX1EqsI/AAAAAAAAAlI/XAmi15NjBOQ/s1600/0008-Shinryaku-Ika-Musume-Squid-Girl.jpg">Squid Girl</a>, and I&#39;ll take over this squidding planet!</p>
<p>Check out the rest of the pics after the break (there&#39;s a lot, 56k warning).[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_avatar.jpg" alt="" title="Not that James Cameron bullshit">
Tai Ling and Azula from Avatar (the Airbending variety). They were part of a larger group, though where those other guys were when I took this picture, I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_chris.jpg" alt="" title="ME GUSTA!">
This was Chris&#39; last minute cosplay, printed on my printer while I was at work, affixed to a piece of cardboard with flour/water paste and finally attached to his sunglasses. He got stopped for pictures more than anybody else. And free hugs. How I hate him &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_me_gusta.jpg" alt="" title="Mmm... yuri....">
Appropriate, methinks.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_dn.jpg" alt="" title="I AM JUSTICE">
A pretty good Death Note group consisting of L, Misa Amane and Light Yagami (from left to right). Though, I think this L is a girl...</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_higurashi.jpg" alt="" title="Gomen na sai!">
Satoka Hojou and Rika Furude from Higurashi. Seeing these two was a bit of a surprise (but a welcome one).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_kitty.jpg" alt="" title="The Whore of Sanrio">
I myself don&#39;t care for Hello Kitty, but I thought my sisters would enjoy it. Not to mention, watching this person awkwardly walk through the crowded vendor room was a bit amusing.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_medic.jpg" alt="" title="MEDIC!">
The medic from TF2. I don&#39;t think this person has a license to practice medicine.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_tf2.jpg" alt="" title="Burn, baby burn!">
Pyro and Demo man, also from TF2. btw, I should say: Two Fort is the greatest map of all time. OF ALL TIME!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_naruto.jpg" alt="" title="A-ano?">
Hinata Hyuuga and and Gaara of Naruto fame. There were plenty of Naruto cosplayers, most not as good as the ones I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8rHf70GFg">saw at Jacon</a>, but these were okay enough to warrant a picture. And that Gaara&#39;s actually a guy. Good for him.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_pokemans.jpg" alt="" title="Gotta catch &#39;em... ugh, so 1999">
Three various Pokemon trainers. The right one is Ash (I think) and I know the middle one is the new girl option, but I don&#39;t know much Pokemans anything. I do know, though, that when they return to their respective pokeballs, there&#39;s enough energy create to fuse oxygen and ignite the atmosphere. Cooool.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_sakura.jpg" alt="" title="Hadouken?">
Sakura from Street Fighter. Honestly, don&#39;t know much SF either, but she is wearing a school girl outfit. HAHA! I&#39;m not creepy &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_snake.jpg" alt="" title="SNAAAAAAAKE">
Solid Snake... again. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen at least one Snake at every con I&#39;ve been to.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_stormy.jpg" alt="" title="TK-1138">
I don&#39;t need to explain this one, though I will say the whole suit was damned amazing, right down to the vocoder in his helmet.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_wolfwood.jpg" alt="" title="That ain&#39;t no Jesus cross, ladies and gentleman.">
Wolfwood from Trigun. Poor guy was trying to fix his &quot;cross&quot; when I bugged him for a picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_yoko.jpg" alt="" title="PIERCE THE HEAVENS">
I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: I want a Yoko &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_zelda.jpg" alt="" title="What can I say here? These guys don&#39;t talk...">
A much better Zelda cosplay. So good, in fact, that the girl dressed as Zelda got second place in the cosplay contest.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_fett.jpg" alt="" title="No disintegrations">
A black garbed Boba Fett? Regardless, still a bitchin&#39; costume.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_hammer.jpg" alt="" title="The hamme is his penis">
Captain Hammer from Dr. Horrible&#39;s Sing-a-long Blog. Something I would not have expected.</p>
<p>So, those are all the pictures I have for all you fine people (19 photos should be more than enough to satiate you). I may write some thoughts on the panels and con itself later this week. Till then... DE GESO!</p>
