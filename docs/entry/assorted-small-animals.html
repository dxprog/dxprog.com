Even though I&#39;ll only be able to bowl twice I&#39;m still excited. I&#39;ve been bowling twice in the last couple of weeks and did really well, all games over average and two over two hundred. I could even have some beers if I wanted. T&#39;will be an awesome time to be sure.</p>
<p>Today <em>also</em> marks the two week mark until I leave for Florida. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m currently bored out of my skull. I got most of my packing done <em>last</em> week so that&#39;s done. I really don&#39;t have much to pack, really. What packing is left to do is of the stuff I use regularly... wait. I <em>have</em> said this before :-/. Granted, I haven&#39;t packed the kitchen stuffs yet so there is something left to do. I also need to get my haircut at some point.</p>
<p>That isn&#39;t to say I&#39;ve been completely idle. I did do that little <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html">YPN</a> thingy. I&#39;ve been playing some games that I never finished <em>ahem</em> Thousand Year Door <em>ahem</em>. I <em>was</em> going to make another short movie, but lack of wardrobe kind of puts a damper on that. You&#39;d think it&#39;d be a simple matter finding a white wig, but no. Not in Bartlesville.</p>
<p>Whilst I was out on one of these wig finding missions I ran across something at a local craft store. It was a cheap glue gun (packaged and distributed in my good state of Oklahoma). It looks fairly standard to the casual observer but reading the fine print reveals, well see for yourself:</p>

<p>Needless to say I&#39;m sending it in to Jay and hopefully it&#39;ll make headlines some night. If it does I&#39;ll be sure to have a YouTube clip up here the next day.</p>
