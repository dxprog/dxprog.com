Work the last few days hasn&#39;t been nearly as bad as it had been, but still icky all the same. This morning was rather interesting, however. The district manager came to pay a visit today and the place was abuzz making sure everything was neat, organized, etc. It&#39;s kind of like what most college kids do when their parents come over: let things slide till the man shows up.</p>
<p>But, anyways, I e-mailed my supervisor yesterday (yeah, I&#39;ve got corporate e-mail. &#39;Tis cool) and asked him exactly when I&#39;d be going back to cashiering, and, thank heavens, he said probably between the first and fifth of May. I&#39;d personally figured on the sixth since it begins a new work week, but the earlier the better :-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be getting up early tomorrow and try to get my appointment in for the driving test again. Hopefully I&#39;ll be luckier than I was last week. If that fails I&#39;ll try again on Wednesday. I&#39;m really itching to get the thing because then I work on getting my spice orange Chevy Aveo:</p>

<p>&#39;Tis sweet, no?</p>
<p>I bought the new DS &quot;game&quot; Brain Age the other day and I have got to say it is one of the sweetest things I&#39;ve played in some time. My current brain age is 28, 20 being the ideal, down from 55 a couple days ago currently beating everybody else who&#39;s got a profile on my card (Mom, Jeff, and Chris). I&#39;ve also discovered Sudoku. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve scoffed at it all this time because it&#39;s very similiar to MasterMind in terms of solving it. However, I still like MasterMind. IT RAWKS!!</p>
