Must get awful picture off the front page!</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve mentioned before that I&#39;m eagerly awaiting Eternal Sonata, the RPG making its way towards Xbox 360 sometime in September. Actually, it was a (if not <em>the</em>) primary reason I bought the console in the first place. Halo is good and all, but my heart lies with RPGs and other story type games (i.e. Pheonix Wright).</p>
<p>So, anyways, I&#39;d heard from a fairly reliable source that the latest Xbox magazine had a demo disc with ES on it. Almost immediately I went out and purchased a copy (I wasn&#39;t the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/07/18">only one</a>). But, with these thing rarely is the pot of gold so easily obtained. Nay, the bastard disc wouldn&#39;t load. Well, it would but it would only give me small nuggets of which I hungered for only to choke mere mintes (or less) into said meal. I was pissed.</p>
<p>Lucky for me I went back an reread the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/07/18">news post</a> for the comic I referenced up above and it held a small morsel of hope. An obscure reference to something about <a href="http://forum.teamxbox.com/showthread.php?t=517777">boiling discs</a> to resurrect them from DVD hell. I didn&#39;t really expect much but I needed to play this demo (and I didn&#39;t really want to be gypped out of $8.99). So I nuked some water in the microwave and slipped the disc in. Much to my surprise all problems were erased and I was one with the game... until the demo ended.</p>
<p>As for the game itself it is pure joy encapsulated inside a stream of binary ones and zeros. The artwork is fantastic, the gameplay is solid. I&#39;m hoping that the same will be said for the story as there isn&#39;t much sampling of that but from what I&#39;ve seem I think all will be well. It&#39;ll definitely be worth my sixty clams and will get me through the couple of weeks between when I move in and school starts.</p>
<p>Well, I think that was sufficient enough to get the evil off the front page. At least the initial load, that is. I would be careful about how far and how fast you scroll down the page.</p>
