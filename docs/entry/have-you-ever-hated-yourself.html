Before anybody cries foul, I don&#39;t hate myself. I&#39;m a very content person and more or less happy with who I am. And beside, I&#39;m going to a kick ass school (one month from yesterday) so life is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>However, the last few days I took a trip to the past and came face to face with my younger, stupider, teenage self. What started out as a kind of fun little programming project quickly brought home that, yes, I was a complete douche bag. It was just a small project to keep me occupied (which it did), but...</p>
<p>I restored the old <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/index.html">YPN message board</a>. It was kind of fun to read some of the old stuff from before I came on, but the minute I started getting to my posts the pain came on. It was obvious that I was... different. I was trying to fit in a crowd of very different people but I thought I was cool like them. If I saw something that pissed me off (and it didn&#39;t have to be much) I&#39;d make some idiot remark instead of just shutting up and moving on. When I came to power it was obvious it went straight to my head. Most of that is more apparent in the days after the old phpBB forum (which I have not gone through), but it all begins right there.</p>
<p>For your enjoyment I have provided a list of all the groan moments:
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/visual-basic.html">Visual Basic</a> - In which I become kage-chan&#39;s bitch/lackey
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/comp-specs.html">Comp Specs</a> - Reopening a locked thread, and check out my triple post at the bottom. That eraser trick was pretty sweet, though. Too bad mechanical mice are non-existant anymore.
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/php-viewer.html">PHP Viewer</a> - No comment
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/siblings.html">Siblings</a> - I&#39;m still not good in ethical debates which is why I avoid them like the plague.
<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/ypn/topic/workaround-for-when-ass-is-in-nonvulgar-words-like-bottomembly.html">Workaround for when &quot;ass&quot; is in nonvulgar words (like bottomembly)</a> - devusb - I told you this happened before me :-P.</p>
<p>I look back on these posts and think to myself &quot;surely that wasn&#39;t me,&quot; but I&#39;m the only person on the internet with the dxprog moniker. It had to be.</p>
