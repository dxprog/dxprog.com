My thoughts: This guy is way too nerdy. That doesn&#39;t look too good on his part considering that I am a self-professed geek. But he didn&#39;t stop there, he also addressed the school board dressed in [Jedi robes/0.jpg" alt="youtube video">](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLi5B0Iefsk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLi5B0Iefsk</a>]
My thoughts: This guy is way too nerdy. That doesn&#39;t look too good on his part considering that I am a self-professed geek. But he didn&#39;t stop there, he also addressed the school board dressed in [Jedi robes)(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJKkjcPLBzE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJKkjcPLBzE</a>). But, just because a guy is nerdy doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect upon his ability to perform the duties and obligations that come part and parcel with the position he is trying to fill. Oh, but wait... he&#39;s got a strike against him in that department as well:</p>

And that smiley face just isn&#39;t doing it for me.</p>
