I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been said on this blog, but I love the shit out of Ninty&#39;s 16-bit era. So much goodness packed into such small computing power. None of this generic brown and grey shooter bullshit, just unadulterated awesomeness.</p>

<p>Three out of the four are rebuys, but the amount of money spent was small comparing to their American counterparts. The most I paid for any of these was $21 and that was Yoshi&#39;s Island. FFVI, which generally runs for $25-$80 used in the States, I got for a cool $12, box and all. Good times fo sho.</p>
<p>If my After Effects stops crashing, I pulled together a shitty video showing the differences between the American and Japanese release of the same-games I have, so that&#39;ll probably be up tomorrow. It&#39;s interesting stuff, really.</p>
