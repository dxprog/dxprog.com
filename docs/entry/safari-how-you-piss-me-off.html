Safari, however, is pissing me off. The colors on here don&#39;t render properly. It&#39;s the same problem that plagued IE4-5. So the gradient at the top doesn&#39;t properly blend into the background. Instead it&#39;s a disgusting blocky chunk. At that the gradient isn&#39;t smooth like it&#39;s doing some sort of weird compression thing a la AOL. Apple, if you&#39;re software &quot;just works&quot; why does it have problems that were fixed over ten years ago? Bastards.</p>
<p>Anyways... I now have less than one month in my current place of residence. On September 18th I set sail (heh) for Florida and my future. It&#39;s about the only thing I think about and it&#39;s making time go incredibly slow. To say I&#39;m looking forward to the move would be like saying Jesus is a good man. But, I do not wish to dwell on the topic and more.</p>
<p>Yesterday I rented Mario Strikers Charged (Wii). It&#39;s okay. Online play is always a plus, but they really dropped the ball on the music. Every piece of music is a two to five second loop. It really, really, really blows chunks. But the game itself is pretty fun and it controls well. So if you just mute the TV and turn on some tunes its not so bad. Too bad the Wii doesn&#39;t support this instrisnicly like a certain other console...</p>
