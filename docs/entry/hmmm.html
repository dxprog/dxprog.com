I&#39;ll get it changed around at some point :-P.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#39;s comic will probably be a little late (possibly into Saturday morning) because of the complexity of the artwork. I have it currently about half drawn, so I&#39;ll probably doodle out the rest tonight and get it colored and junk tomorrow. So, sorry about that. Stay tuned.</p>
