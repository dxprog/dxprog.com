<p>Not trying to be immodest or anything here, but I think this has to be the best joke I&#39;ve done. And, yes, they really did say that in the stupid movie. I&#39;m still of the mind that that whole movie was all faked to some degree or another (aside from the fact that he gained weight). I mean, his first burger, a double quarter pounder or something, took him nearly an hour or so to eat and then he puked it all up? Talk about a girly man. His name is Morgan, so you know I&#39;m right ;-).</p>
