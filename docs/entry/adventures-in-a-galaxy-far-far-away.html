<p>As stated before, I don&#39;t recall exactly when I learned to read; there is just the period of my life before literacy and the period after. I must&#39;ve learned it while I was still going to school, but the details escape me. I remember reading stuff while there, but not what was read save for one thing: the Boxcar Children. It was read during class at some point and, while I wasn&#39;t necessarily enthralled during that time, I remembered enough to make attack a mountain of Boxcar Children books that were given to us by my Scholastic employed Godmother. I don&#39;t know how many of those things I read, but it was quite a lot. How a series goes from being a one-off tale about orphans living in a box car and finding family to various tales of adventure and mystery is beyond me. I suspect these were all pretty shitty books. Even then, I was never able to finish the second one despite numerous attempts to do so. Not sure why...</p>
<p>Another series that I read a fair amount of in my younger years was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a>. I don&#39;t think there are very many children of the 90s who <em>didn&#39;t</em> read Goosebumps. Again, I don&#39;t recall much about these save for two things: they scared the shit out of me and Say Cheese and Die was awesome. Actually, thinking back on the story, it&#39;s a little like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_note">Death Note</a>, only the Note in this case is a camera and the bearer doesn&#39;t actually intend for people to die. I think maybe I should read that book again...</p>
<p>There were other books and series in there: the Hardy Boys, Lord of the Rings, the Belgariad and its sequel, and various classics in the form of <a href="http://www.seriesbooks.com/cart/catalog.aspx?cid=222">Moby Books</a> amoungst others. But there&#39;s one fictional universe in particular that has shaped my life in more ways than I could possibly imagine, from the sheer amount of time spent reading to actual changes in my behaviour. I am, of course, talking about Star Wars.</p>
<p>To date, I have read no less than 78 Star Wars books (yes, I&#39;ve counted), ranging from the first, small novels by Alan Dean Foster up to the New Jedi Order series and its whopping nineteen novels. I don&#39;t know exactly what my first Star Wars book was, but I&#39;m inclined to say it was probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Jedi_Knights_Series">Junior Jedi Knights</a> book <em>The Golden Globe</em> which I read when I was twelve. I didn&#39;t spend too long in that series initially and quickly &quot;graduated&quot; to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Jedi_Knights">Young Jedi Knights</a>. Finally eschewing the children&#39;s series, I went on to read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jedi_Academy_trilogy">Jedi Academy trilogy</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Wing_Series">X-wing series</a>, and of course, the phenomenal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrawn_trilogy">Thrawn trilogy</a>. To this day, the Thrawn trilogy is probably my favorite series of books and its author, Timothy Zahn, also amoungst my favorites.</p>
<p>At my peak, I was reading at the pace of a Star Wars novel a day, sometimes blowing through three or four a week. Star Wars literature - and the universe that it created in my mind - engrossed me for probably a good six or seven years of my life. I cannot think any other single thing in my life that so consumed me. All good things must come to an end, however, and once I completed the New Jedi Order series, my Star Wars mania was spent. The last time I picked up a Star Wars book was in late &#39;08 as I waited overnight for a bus at the Orlando airport. But, I do not regret for a minute the time that I spent behind the pages of these books. I actually attribute a lot of my English skills - from spoken to written - to these books. I know for a fact that it was in a Star Wars novel that I first encountered the word &quot;ricochet&quot;, the phrases &quot;oft used&quot; and &quot;delusions of granduer&quot;, and how I began the use of the term &quot;blast&quot; in swearing (something one of my former bosses thought was &quot;cute&quot;).</p>
<p>After my Star Wars days, my reading of fiction dropped to almost nothing for the longest time; partially because I began working, partially due to the internet and site like Slashdot and Digg which provided articles relevant to my interests. I wouldn&#39;t become heavily invested in reading again until mid 2009 as a new genre caught my attention...</p>
