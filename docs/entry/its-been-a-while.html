So I guess I&#39;ll start by dropping this bomb: Hi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as many know, I turned the magical 20. I can&#39;t even be called a teenager anymore, so basically all my ties with kiddom have been severed. Though, that hasn&#39;t stopped me from watching a cartoon I used to tune in to religously every morning: <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70045113&amp;trkid=189530&amp;strkid=11816394_1_0">The Super Mario Super Show</a>. The show itself actually isn&#39;t all the bad once you get past the fact that Bowser was named King Koopa back then and that the live action stuff oozes 80s. <em>sniff</em> It was a golden age.</p>
<p>Back to the present, however, I&#39;ve been considering selling off my old NES collection and buying a used Xbox off eBay. The way I see it, not only would I be able to play Halo 2, but I&#39;d probably soft-mod the thing and then I could run the stuff on emulator  (of games I own, mind you). Also, I could use the all powerful <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">Xbox Media Center (XBMC)</a>. The more I read about the thing the more I drool. It&#39;ll play basically any video/audio file you feed from anywhere (including the network). Talk about sweet justice.</p>
<p>In work related news, not much new. However, I believe I am going to become a lowly cart pusher. Now I know there are some questions on your mind, namely: But isn&#39;t that cut in pay? Won&#39;t you bake out in the sun? I wonder if this candy bar I found under the couch is still edible? The answers are yes, yes and you&#39;ll probably die if you eat it. Actually, three little words sum things up: shorts and free gatorade (wait, that&#39;s four...) But, I digress. I&#39;ve always had more fun outside than inside and being stuck behind the register drives me insane (mainly the not moving part). I need to be moving and doing something. Take now for instance. My fingers are moving all over the place whilst my lazy butt relaxes in bed.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I&#39;ll get to bed now. I&#39;ll try to have the comic finished and posted before I go to work tomorrow, otherwise look for it in the wee hours of Saturday morning.</p>
