<p>Well, Christmas paper shredding has come and gone once again. All that excitement and anticipation over with the course of a couple hours. Ah, but a pretty sweet Christmas it was. So, I bet the question on the tip of your tounges is &quot;What&#39;dya get?&quot;. Here&#39;s the run down: glass chess set (frosted even :-D), laptop backpack, CF card reader/writer, a &quot;Pedro&#39;s Got your Back&quot; and a nice flannel shirt, some money and a gift card, a Dave Berry book, and the piece de resitance: my own cell phone :-D. Quite a cool one at that. Basic, but it suits my needs. Actually, truth be told, it does some stuff that my parents fancier phone doesn&#39;t do, namely the ability to use SMS web services (such as google). Quite sweet, quite sweet.</p>
<p>The last few days I&#39;ve been delving into GBA dev again and something seems to have finally clicked. I understand how loading sprites works and all that malarkey and so I&#39;ve begun my GBA Tetris Attack clone. And actually it&#39;s coming along quite nicely. Debugging is a pain in the but since I don&#39;t have a debug console or files to write ciritcal values to, but I&#39;m chugging along all the same.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if I haven&#39;t mentioned already, I go to discuss my future at Wal-Mart (Christmas Eve marked my last day in layaway). I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ll end up exactly, but at this point in time cart pusher seems most likely. Now I know I was complaining earlier, but I&#39;ve done it a couple of times since and I&#39;ll tell you that being able to use the QuickCart makes it a heckuva lot easier. My other option is cashier, but dislike that even more (though if it was back in electronics I might reconsider). I personally wouldn&#39;t mind working in claims or as an overnight stocker (both of which I have done). Whenever there was nothing to do in layaway after closing I&#39;d usually get sent to toys to help them stock and I must say it was a lot of fun (I did chemicals one night and I liked that too). So we&#39;ll just see tomorrow (and I&#39;ll post something about it).</p>
<p>Ah, but now it is getting late and I&#39;ve got presents to play with (maybe I&#39;ll go blow Jeff away in a game of chess). Stay tuned for an interesting video clip from yesterday morning. It&#39;s absolutely hilarious. Cheers!</p>
