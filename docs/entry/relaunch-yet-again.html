I have redesigned and relaunched this website. Granted, I managed to go nearly two years without touching it. That&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s new? Outside of an enormous code reworking to take into account the wonderful new OOP changes in PHP 5.3 and the obvious new look, here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive design: not everything has this treatment (art page), but all the main pages should display themselves nicely no matter what device you view them on.</li>
<li>Threaded comments: if you reply to a message, your reply will display underneath, <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/useless-justification/#comments">like this</a>.</li>
<li>Removal of SSO for comments: no more twitter, no more facebook. Gravatar is also used for avatars.</li>
<li>Better lightbox: every image in a blog post will display in a lightbox when clicked (larger if there happens to be a larger image). This same lightbox is also used for the art page</li>
<li>Art page is all pintresty. Because, hey, why not.</li>
<li>Content reorganization: gone is the video tab, here is the &quot;code&quot; tab with all sorts of random code projects of mine.</li>
<li>Popular art module. That&#39;s new.</li>
<li>Cloud tag has been removed.</li>
<li>Archives is a list again and smarter in that it will select what year to show depending on the context of the page you&#39;re on.</li>
<li>Code snippets use the Solarized theme</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#39;s what&#39;s new on the front end. As stated, most of the fun stuff is all in the code changes. And, for the first time ever, you can see the code that&#39;s running this site on its <a href="https://github.com/dxprog/DxCMS">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
