Such is true for my one week of summer vacation. It was brief, yet enjoyable. Got to celebrate my birthday with my family, eat grilled food and lots of potato salad, and also take the usual trip to Tulsa. It&#39;s a pity that it was so short, but I&#39;m complaining too much. The school is giving me a bachelor&#39;s degree in less than two years, so this time next year I&#39;ll be out of school. But that&#39;s a story for another day.</p>
<p>As you may <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/its-super-awesome-vacation-time/">recall</a>, last month began my two month long journey through the wonders of Flash. Last month focused primarily on Flash as it pertains to design, teaching us the interface, motion tweens, and just a hint of ActionScript. This month, however, is dedicated to nothing but ActionScript. To demonstrate these &quot;newly acquired skills&quot; our final project consists of making a game.</p>
<p>Now, I put &quot;newly acquired&quot; in quotes for a reason. For anybody who&#39;s frequented this blog long enough you should know by now that I am, or at least used to be, heavy into coding. Because of this I have an unfair advantage over the rest of the class in this regard and as such I am taking my project to ridiculous extents (far above the scope of the course). The nice thing, though, is that the instructor actually acknowledges the fact that I am as proficient as I am, so much so that I took the place of the lab instructor for one day (whilst the real one was waiting in line for his iPhone 3G). Being able to talk to the instructor about geeky stuff as equals is a nice departure. But, enough ego stroking, about the actual project itself.</p>
<p>I chose to challenge myself and create essentially a dumbed down clone of Street Fighter, but be completely extensible through external configuration files. The first thing I avoided was the use of graphics inside Flash itself opting instead to load sprite sheets from external sources. Everything is configured through XML sheets that define how a character should react, define where animations are within a sprite sheet, stages, etc. Amazingly, I&#39;ve achieved most of this and all very, very quickly. The biggest problem I foresee is the addition of enemy AI, but I&#39;ve got ideas on how to achieve this as well. Overall, though, I&#39;m loving being back at the helm of the coding ship. I&#39;d forgotten how much of a thrill can be derived from hours of typing if statements and nested for loops. Damn, it&#39;s good to be back.</p>
