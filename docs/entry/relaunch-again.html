There&#39;s quite a bundle of changes in this version both under the hood and... over it? Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New look</strong> The most obvious change is, of course, the new look. I&#39;ve opted to go for a super clean look with more attention paid to the textual layout.</li>
<li><strong>Unified content model</strong> This means that items from my portfolio, artwork, videos or blog can all be displayed in the same list yet be treated differently for display. It reduces a lot of code and makes for a much nicer, streamlined presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Commenting upgrades</strong> In addition to being able to use your twitter account to sign-in, there&#39;s now the option of Facebook and anonymous. Also, comments are broken down into pages of fifty (there&#39;s <a href="http://matthackmann.net/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows">only one post</a> where you can see this in action).</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> I&#39;ve done a lot of changes to the backend structure to enhance load times. The average load time as I&#39;m writing this is well under a tenth of a second.</li>
<li><strong>Comics</strong> As much as I loathe some of those comics, dxprog.com is meant to be a repository of all my work. As such, you can view the entire Digital Double archive by clicking &quot;Comics&quot; up on the top nav. I&#39;m going to work on getting the newer stuff in as I finish importing content.</li>
<li><strong>Sidebars</strong> There have been many tweaks and additions made to the various sidebars. The first I&#39;d like to point out is the &quot;Most Popular&quot; which, as the name implies, is a listing of the current most popular items on the site. Another interesting one is &quot;Last Listend To&quot; which displays the last song I&#39;ve listened to through my <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. Finally, the archives and tag clouds have been given some nice overhauls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these are just the noticable differences. The amount of changes in the codebase are wide sweeping and quite substantial, but will allow for a much more maintainable codebase in the future. I plan on releasing the source within the next month or so after I&#39;ve had a opportunity to watch it in the wild and fully document it. Until then, I hope you enjoy the new site. If you&#39;re having issues or have a suggestion, please feel free to leave comment!</p>
