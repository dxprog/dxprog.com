<p>I have an incredibly sordid past. Sadly all of these (except the last one, of course) are true. This was during a time when good old GoldenPalace.com would seemingly buy just about anything. So I would track the stories of their purchases and true to stay one step ahead. Didn&#39;t really work. However, I will go into some detail behind each one.</p>
<p>The Common Cold - February of &#39;05, I believe it was, I had a nasty cold. Put me in bed for about a week. Shortly after I got better I decided to try and sell the common cold, one of the &quot;oldest human diseases of all time&quot;. I blew my nose into a tissue, stuffed into a zippy bag and made up a little &quot;facts sheet&quot;. I must&#39;ve still be delerious from that cold :-P.</p>
<p>The Darth Vader Pancake - I&#39;ve had a few people ask how I made the Vader &quot;face&quot; in the pancake. What I did was scratched the design into a piece of aluminum foil, layed that in the bottom of the pan and the parts of the batter that actually connected with the pan wound up darker leaving the Vader impression on the morsel. I believe it was like 2 or 3 in the morning when I did this. Sad to say nbody bought the pancake and I wound up eating it about a week or two after making it. It didn&#39;t really taste that good.</p>
<p>The John Paul II Photomosaic - I basically cover the story in the comic. However, it did take me two or three nights to glean all those religious pictures off of Google image search. Then I just ran everything through some fancy butt software and there it was. I thought I was going to be printing my own money. Not really. The picture sat on our mantle for a while before I reclaimed my frame and put my <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/obi_subway.png">Obi-wan Eats at Subway</a> picture in it where it hangs on my wall even to this day.</p>
<p>I have sold other things on eBay (legit and not so much). One thing I attempted to sell was loz.twilight.princess@gmail.com. This was shortly after that xbox 360 address snagged a gob of dough. But, anyhoo, I&#39;ve rambled long enough.</p>
