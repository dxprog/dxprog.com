Just when I think I&#39;m making or about to make progress on something, WHAM! Something&#39;s in my way ruining those plans.</p>
<h2 id="hakk-s-lab-episode-1">Hakk&#39;s Lab Episode 1</h2>
<p>The first episode of Hakk&#39;s Lab is supposed to be a rebuild of the power/video board on my Famicom (partially because I destroyed the original one). Those screenshots I&#39;ve been posting of PCBs was supposed to be for that, the idea being I was going to mill the board on my PCB because it seemed the easiest. To that end, I began getting the CNC machine set back up... and then my garage computer died. Replaced the garage computer, updated my CNC to the latest firmware and... it suddenly doesn&#39;t know how to move anymore. Do a bunch of googling, fix the issues with the motor direction and things are looking good... except now my Z axis is unable to move more than an inch down. I don&#39;t even know where to go next without taking the whole machine apart... well, fuck.</p>
<h2 id="hakk-s-lab-episode-1-alternate-idea">Hakk&#39;s Lab Episode 1 - Alternate idea</h2>
<p>Itching to just get <em>something</em> out, I dipped into a different episode idea: modding a Super Game Boy to fix the clock speed problem... and that went really well! All the filming got done, the mod itself was pretty much there... and then it didn&#39;t work. Okay, cool. Just fix it up and leave that part out of editing. Oh... I just broke one of the pins off of this surface mount chip and now the whole cartridge is basically ruined... well, fuck.</p>
<h2 id="react-rfc">React RFC</h2>
<p>This one didn&#39;t have any real surprise behind it, but the RFC for React I created the other day was indeed rejected. Not for any fault of mine beyond the idea <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12396">goes in a difrection that React doesn&#39;t want to</a>. A fair point, but now I&#39;ve got no clean way forward for bringing back the RSS feeds... well, fuck.</p>
<p>Arguably, these are very comfy problems to have, but it&#39;s getting annoying having stuff constantly derailing me as I&#39;ve finally mustered up some resolve to do them. To the Hakk&#39;s Lab thing, I decided to go with my initial idea but just etch the PCB in the old-fashioned way with caustic chemicals. Hopefully that goes a bit better.</p>
