I couldn&#39;t just take that sitting down, so here I am in a [mother disapproved word removed]-wagging contest, a contest which really doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>I love to talk about how lazy I am. For instance, sometimes when I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;ll just continue being hungry because I don&#39;t want to stare into the cupboards and figure out what to make, or I just don&#39;t want to clean all the required hardware. Or perhaps there&#39;s just no food to be had. Either way, this is a thing that happens and it certainly has all the hallmarks of laziness.</p>
<p>But to say I&#39;m lazy overall isn&#39;t really true. I am selectively lazy. When it comes to programming tasks (or anything computer related, really) I&#39;m always up to something. At the moment, I&#39;m up to a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Work</strong></p>
<p>I have been working on and off all weekend trying to pump out a gratuitous amount of code in a stack that I have no business touching. During one of our team meetings, I set a bar for myself by telling everybody that I would take on a beefy amount of engineering work because I feel I have to prove myself (through many discussions with the people I work with, this is apparently incorrect thinking). That&#39;s actually only part of it; it seemed like a fun challenge. And this has shown to be more or less correct, as I&#39;ve lost some hours just pounding away at the keyboard. The long compile times aren&#39;t fun, but I&#39;ve learned a fuckton of stuff, both about how your <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/conanobrien">LinkedIn profile page</a> is pulled together, but also a bit about Java and a bit more about OOP. Besides, those compile times are easily whiled away by playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_25th_Anniversary_(NES_video_game">Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</a>) game for NES.</p>
<p>On top of that, there&#39;s a presentation I need to write pretty damn soon. I have been chosen to pitch web development at LinkedIn to a throng of up and comings at my alma mater next month. I haven&#39;t even started on that...</p>
<p><strong>Awwnime Bracket</strong></p>
<p>Last year&#39;s awwnime bracket only got a <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/weekend-of-productivity/">couple</a> of <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/">nods</a> in the blog despite eating up nearly two solid months of my life. This year it&#39;s coming back, but we&#39;re also running an additional bracket for male characters (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1n5q2t/2013_boys_bracket_round_1_group_a/">which came with it&#39;s own set of problems</a>). In an attempt to make things actually manageable, I spent some time into moving all my one off shell scripts into the code base proper and writing an administrative interface around that. Additionally, I moved away from the money sucking <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me.s3.amazonaws.com/bracket/bracket_round1_groupB.jpg?v7">giant images</a> and switch to something <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-boys-bracket/view/">rendered in browser</a>. It&#39;s also much friendlier to interactiveness that way.</p>
<p><strong>Freelance</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that I keep promising myself I&#39;ll never freelance again, the sweet allure of &quot;free money&quot; is too much. Now, the upside is I haven&#39;t had to bust my ass on any of the one (possible two) projects in the pipeline at this point, but still, they hang over me ling a large, swinging axe.</p>
<p><strong>Other things in the wings</strong></p>
<p>On top of all that, there are still items in the backburner. Fixes/updates to redditbooru, especially the backend service. I majiggered the main part off of a cron job and into a node run task (initially to curb an issue I experienced after upgrading to php 5.5), but now that the code is there, I can multithread that bitch. On top of that, there are changes I&#39;d love to make to the music page, the music page physical controller I&#39;ve been tinkering with, and the iPhone app that I&#39;ve begun writing for it.</p>
<p>My plate is full of computery things for sure, despite what I say about laziness. I&#39;m probably heading straight for a burnout, but these things ebb and flow, and right now they&#39;re just flowing.</p>
<p>I guess you could say I&#39;m on my development period...</p>
