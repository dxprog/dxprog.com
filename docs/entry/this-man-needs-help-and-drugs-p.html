The guy running the site made it sound like they were all &quot;tricked out&quot;, if you will. Intrigued, I e-mailed him asking what was under the hood. His e-mail, apparently a pre-written response, was a fitting answer to a thread going on in the story&#39;s comments, so I answered them with the text of the e-mail I got.</p>
<p>Enter zulhadm.</p>
<p>Apparently this guy also e-mailed and got the same reply. My comment was digged up, his was dugg down (despite what he may say, my comment was posted way before his). He was mad. So, he started making slanderous remarks, starting out on my own blog:</p>
<p>&quot;Matt you suck. You take other people&#39;s work on digg and pass it as if its your own. Learn RESPECT &quot;</p>
<p>I thought maybe it had something to do with me posting a link on digg of Chris&#39; Reggie Pic of the Week. I had no idea that he&#39;d posted that comment on digg. So, all was good. Until I get an e-mail from senior usb. This guy was so pissed he posted <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Diary_of_a_BAD_programmer">this</a> on digg:</p>
<p><strong>Diary of a BAD programmer</strong></p>
<p>DO NOT HIRE HIM. Known as &quot;Matt Hackmann&quot; to the net community this sketchy, untrustworthy character has no business working in the IT Industry. I added some very relevant information to the following digg story: <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/">http://digg.com/tech_news/</a> Site_hosted_on_two_23_year_old_Lisa2_computers Matt took credit for the added info when it wasn&#39;t his!!!!</p>
<p>So, in the end, he made himself look like a class-A asshole. And all of it over a little comment. Wow, this is one eff-d up world.</p>
