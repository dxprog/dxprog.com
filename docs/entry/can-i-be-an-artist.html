Well, nearly one month later, I get this back:</p>

<p>85 out of 100, they gave me. There&#39;s apparently a whole bunch of shit that goes into making this &quot;composite score&quot;, namely accuracy, stroke quality, shading and tones, and &quot;design concepts&quot;. I feel I should have gotten a 0 because I broke the one and only rule... draw <strong>one</strong> subject.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m not 100% certain that this wasn&#39;t just rubber stamped on. The sheet I got back was a scan of my original paper, and closely examining the lettering suggests that it was (at some point) handwritten because all the Os are different, but still.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll consider this my control and send in another form under a different <em>nym</em>, but draw something completely off topic, very badly rendered, or perhaps both.</p>
