<p>Anybody who watched Nickelodeon around the turn of the century will remember these Verb commercials, a ploy by the government to try to get fatass kids outside and active. One commercial in particular told you to &quot;pick a verb&quot;. Now, a verb is a word that expresses action or a state of being, not just something that denotes physical activity. There was an episode of Family Ties that had a rather humorous bit about how die could be a verb. But, I digress. If you go to the Verb <a href="http://www.verbnow.com">website</a> there&#39;s this creepy green chick dancing up in the top, left corner. I bet she chose smoke as her verb.</p>
