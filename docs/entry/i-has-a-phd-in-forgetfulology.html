Well, perfect being that I am, I experienced a couple of these recently.</p>
<p>Firstly, when I was making a certain <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/how-does-one-spend-their-25th-birthday/">video</a>, there is a shot that was taken from inside my refrigerator. Some items needed to be shuffled to make this happen and when I groggily stupored out of my room the next morning, I was greeted by a warm gallon of milk sitting out on my counter. Goddammmit!</p>
<p>Stupid moment number two came not twenty-four hours later. That night I stopped the washer so that I could take my shower. The next morning, knowing that I had washed laundry the night before, I was about to transfer the clothes in the washer to the dryer only to be greeted by a washer full of water. SHIT!</p>
