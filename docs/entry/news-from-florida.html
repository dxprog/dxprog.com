Lots of them. Be patient.</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;ll start with the beginning. I was born around 10ish on June 8th, 1986. Life was pretty good until they cut my umbilical cord. You see I... Okay, too far back.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Sept. 17th, was a crazy, hectic day because I really hadn&#39;t packed much up to that point. About the only things I <em>had</em> packed were my books and DVDs. That left this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/1420193247/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1115/1420193247_fa89023cc4.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></a>
(be sure to follow the link. I&#39;ve got region thingies set up on the flickr page)</p>
<p>As you can see it was quite a hellish nightmare. But, I got everything packed and by that evening it looked more like this:

<p>Evening came and morning followed the first day.</p>
<p>The next day, Tuesday, began the first leg of our near thirteen hundred mile trip. After I said goodbye to my family we started off. Then we promptly returned because I&#39;d forgotten some things (that&#39;s not to say I got everything I&#39;d forgotten, though). That day we drove about seven hundred some odd miles, well over half the trip, passing through five states (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama). We stayed in a little town past Birmingham called Oxford. Evening came and morning followed the second day.</p>
<p>There&#39;s really not a whole lot to say about the second day of driving. We passed through Atlanta (uneventfully I might add) and drove from there on down to Florida. One thing I will say about Atlanta, though, is that there&#39;s an assload of cars on the road. Twelve lanes and all of them packed. Once in Winter Park it took about an hour and a half to find our lodging for the night. Luckily we <em>did</em> find it and it was an easy drive to the apartments. We ate at Boston Market that night. It was pretty good (though the service was... weird). I&#39;ll forgo the Genesis reference this time.</p>
<p>So, it was finally the big day (or at least one of them). We made our way over to the apartments and got there without any trouble. However, we did circle the whole complex nearly three times before we found the leasing office which was tucked away discreetly behind some trees. It was there that I met up with my roommate and signed my life away to the dark cabal that controls everything. However, we did get a sweet apartment in return:

<p>As you can see in that last picture we have a sweet TV setup (or I do. It&#39;s all my stuff). The gibberish on the screen is our (at the time) messed up cable. Dragging everything up and in wasn&#39;t to big of a deal and really didn&#39;t take too long. Getting setup, that was another story all together. My room isn&#39;t completely unpacked yet though it&#39;s functioning at one hundred percent capacity.</p>
<p>That evening we went and bought some furniture.</p>
<p>[gallery=The Furniture]<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1179/1420255003_9dbece64bd.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="The most comfortable couch in the world!"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1314/1420255853_82ff3bf7e3.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="...and the lowly coffee table">[/gallery]</p>
<p>The next day we didn&#39;t do much aside from pull in some of the more minor items we needed. I spent a good chunk of the day working on the mess that was my room. I think I did anyways... By this time it was Saturday and I had to see my Dad off as he prepared to redrive the roads we had just been on. We (my roommate and I) didn&#39;t do much over the weekend. Bought some stuff, played some games, watched some TV, drew some pictures. Just kept low. Then came yesterday (Monday).</p>
<p>We were both getting kind of tired of not having much to do so we packed up and went to the beach. Daytona Beach, that is. Up to that point the closest I had ever been to the beach was watching LOST so it was something completely new for me. It was a hell of a lot of fun. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/1437562805_85b20260f6.jpg?v=0" alt="" title="image"></p>
<p>We tossed a Nerf football around, we rode some waves, we walked up the beach (probably a mile or more not including the trip back). Being the off season there weren&#39;t too many people there and at that most of them were seniors. With the exception of the little kids we were the youngest people there. While it was fun and all there was a price to be paid. I had purchased some sunscreen before we&#39;d gotten there, but was unable to get my back. My roommate, who I will refer to as E, didn&#39;t put any on at all. So by the time we got home he was completely red and my back felt like it was on fire. That evening we laid low and watched all the new offerings on NBC and headlines on Jay.</p>
<p>Tonight we&#39;re going to be going to a little meeting thing at the school and tomorrow is registration and the getting of our Mac Book Pros. It&#39;ll be sweet to be sure. I&#39;ll be back a full update including pics. Until then, stay cool.</p>
