NOT! Somehow, and I&#39;ve yet been able to figure out why, my password got reset. Now I figure it&#39;s one of four scenerios:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> A little kid somehow changed the password by pounding on my keyboard
<strong>B)</strong> One of our neighbors has been sitting cracking our WPA passkey the last month (and I think that all of our neighbors have WiFi)
<strong>C)</strong> Some Uber h4x0r who&#39;s peed off at me snuck in via the internet and changed it hoping to make my life miserable
<strong>D)</strong> My SAM file got corrupted</p>
<p>D is the most likely scenerio, but you can&#39;t discount any of the others. Anyhoo, I spent most of yesterday figuring out how to undo it without reinstalling Windows. My first thought was to try the Linux distro <a href="http://cyti.latgola.lv/ruuni/index_en.html">austrumi</a> which has a utility called nt_pass (only in version 0.9.2, btw). Well, that didn&#39;t want to work because, gosh, my SAM file is read-only. Well what jerk wrote <em>that</em> program? :-P</p>
<p>So, I went and did some more searching and came across a little hole in the Windows Istaller. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> You&#39;ll need a Windows XP/2003 CD (any flavor: plain, SP1 or SP2) that&#39;s bootable (I &#39;spect most have this kind)
<strong>B)</strong> Boot with that and get to the point where you can repair a Windows install (Enter, Enter, F8, R I believe is the key sequence)
<strong>C)</strong> Just go along with that. Your computer will reboot and start the second half of the install.
<strong>D)</strong> Be paying atention to the progress bar in the lower left of the screen. When I says &quot;Install Devices&quot; hit F10. You&#39;ll be greeted by a command prompt which will allow you to do darn near anything you want.
<strong>E)</strong> In this particular case run the command &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; and a friendly box will come up where you can reset passwords, add users, etc.
<strong>F)</strong> Once you&#39;ve done whatever it is you&#39;re going to do let Windows finish installing or you&#39;ll lose everything you just did.</p>
<p>Needless to say that I created myself a new user account so I could leave the Aministrator one alone (&#39;tis one of the drawbacks to 2K3. You have to go using the command prompt just to get to a place to add a user :-P). But now I&#39;m back in business and everything works great. I hope somebody out there finds that useful because it sure was to me.</p>
