<p>Today I got a basic graphics stack implemented and working, though it&#39;s riddled with its fair share of bugs and is certainly nowhere near being feature complete (environmental objects, animation, etc). However, I&#39;m having no problem running through entire scenario files having completed the first day in Kanon with no problems. But, on to the screenshots (note - the following where all taken in Chrome 12.0.712.0 dev)!</p>

<p>Because my ultimate goal is to have this working for mobile platforms, I&#39;ve been testing against my iPhone (at least until I&#39;ve got an iPad). Here&#39;s some screens:</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t yet implemented scaling to the device&#39;s screen size (the screen above was pinch-zoomed to the correct size).</p>
<p>I&#39;m okay with the graphics stack for the time being, so I&#39;m going to begin work on one of the last major hurdles with jumping between different scenario files. I&#39;m hoping to have an open beta up soon and hopefully get some feedback from people with various devices.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
