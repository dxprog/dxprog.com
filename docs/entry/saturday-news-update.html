More importantly, however, I need to quit with this &quot;firstly&quot;, &quot;nextly&quot;, &quot;that other thingly&quot;.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock today was my big tour of Full Sail. Up till now I&#39;ve been referring to it as &quot;Full Sail, college of awesomeness&quot; however I think I&#39;ll have to start referring to it as &quot;Full Sail, college of kick ass!&quot;. It is seriously that freakin&#39; cool. When every classroom has computers in it (with the exception of one) you know it has to be cool. I&#39;ll try to describe the experience as best I can, but I won&#39;t be able to do justice to it. Please note that the accuracy of the order of events may be questionable.</p>
<p>It all started in a sound stage where the whole opening presentation was treated like a live talk show. The camera came over our heads for a nice sweeping crane shot and came to rest on the guy giving the opening monologue. There was another group in the adjacent sound stage who were watching in on what went on in ours. Once the opening ceremonies were finished they broke the group into the seperate degree sections (Digital Arts and Design for me) and began the &quot;global tour&quot;, i.e. seeing all of the facilities.</p>
<p>We were first led into one of the lecture rooms and were given a rundown of the &quot;LaunchBox&quot; initiative. What that is is the Full Sail and Apple have teamed together to give every student a Mac Book Pro loaded with fancy software such as <a href="https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/DesignPremium&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;promoid=RWTS&amp;nr=0#loc=en_us&amp;rangeUpper=6%2C0%2C65%2C0&amp;HTMLVerRedirect=true&amp;returnURL=%2Fcfusion%2Fstore%2Fhtml%2Findex%2Ecfm%3Fstore%3DOLS%2DUS%26promoid%3DRWTS%26event%3DdisplayProduct%26categoryPath%3D%2FApplications%2FDesignPremium%26distributionMethod%3DFULL&amp;store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/DesignPremium&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;promoid=RWTS&amp;nr=0&amp;viewName=Adobe%20Store%20%2D%20North%20America&amp;pageNotFound=0">Adobe Creative Suite</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/">Final Cut Pro</a>, and <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=5659302&amp;siteID=123112">3DS Max</a> to name the ones I remember. After they rambled on about that and the masters degree program we actually started looking at the cool stuff.</p>
<p>The first place we visited was the new dubbing studio. If you&#39;ve ever watched making-of documenteries you&#39;ve seen the giant sound board and the little couch behind it for the big wigs. Well, it&#39;s all there. We were seated and shown a clip from Return of the King. Apparently the guy who did sound design for the collapse of Barad-dur was a Full Sail graduate.</p>
<p>After that we went into one of the recording booths were some dudes were giving off a live performance. We didn&#39;t stay there very long, but I will say this: it was very, very loud. Also, we passed the server room on our way out of there. Very, very cool. </p>
<p>Next we were led into the motion capture studio. Sadly, the software wasn&#39;t working quite right and the 3d model&#39;s right ankle was twisted in all sorts of crazy manners. Still, how many other colleges have a motion capture studio, I mean, c&#39;mon. Killer!</p>
<p>I&#39;m not completely sure, but I believe after that we went onto another sound stage which was dressed up as an inner city street with a theater at the end. Apparently this is used to teach lighting techniques. This I look forward to because all the video projects I&#39;ve ever done have terrible lighting and it drives me mad. When you&#39;re going for a specific look and it you don&#39;t have the tools or knowledge to make it happen it gets a little disheartening.</p>
<p>At this point we began the degree specific tour. It started out in the room without computers that I mentioned earlier. It had a bunch of art desks. If I had to guess this is where I&#39;ll be taking my art history course. </p>
<p>After that we went into a classroom filled with twenty-four mac pros. Here we were lectured on the art of 2D print and how it relates to the design process such as company logos and product design. Apparently Illustrator is going to be an integreal part of this class. </p>
<p>Once done there we headed off to hear about motion graphics. This is the part that I&#39;m most excited about. They showed a demo reel from an old student there who went on to do commercials for the likes of MTV, Nickelodeon and the like. It was impressive and I&#39;m definitely looking forward to this. Oh, this room was filled with a bunch of Windows computers.</p>
<p>We were then led out by the coolest guy there (very happy and up-beat) and into yet another room with a bunch of Macs. He filled us in on the wonders of the web not only about the designs but the backend (which will be focusing around PHP). Luckily I&#39;ve got a good deal of experience in both those fields so that should be an easy class. Before heading on to the next stop we passed through one of the labs where final projects are done. Apparently we&#39;ll have more or less free license to do what we want there.</p>
<p>Our last stop in campus was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/487495670/">green screen room</a>. They&#39;ve got equipment that replaces green screen in real-time. The guy who did the lecturing here was practically giving lessons on how to use the software.</p>
<p>We then proceeded across the street to what I am currently calling the auditorium. Essentially it&#39;s a concert stage with the lights and the smoke and whatnot. This place is where any bands come to play and put on a show. Here we were luctured on career development and given a speech by the president of the college. If I wanted to I could&#39;ve gone on a behind the scenes tour of all the light control equipment and stuff, but I was hungry so that was the end of the tour for us.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, words really can&#39;t describe how cool this place is. You have to see it (in person) to get how freakin&#39; awesome it really is. The only caveat I see to this all is that I still have to wait five months until I start. It&#39;s going to feel very unsatisfying to go back to cart pushing after this.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say about Orlando (possibly Florida as a whole). The whole place smells like it&#39;s been perfumed. It&#39;s a scent I noticed stepping off the plane. I first thought it was indigineous to the airport but it&#39;s like everywhere. Almost like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefly_planets_and_moons#Miranda">another place</a> we&#39;ve heard about....</p>
<p>Well, that was really, really long so I&#39;ll wrap it up. At noon tomorrow (Eastern time) we depart for Memphis again. Until then, peace out.</p>
