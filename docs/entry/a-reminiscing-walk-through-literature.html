<p>Ever since I was a wee lad, reading has been more or less a main stay past time of mine. Even before I myself could read (an act I don&#39;t recall learning), books have been a part of my life in some form or fashion. For the next couple of posts - as it&#39;s the best idea I&#39;ve had for a blog post in these weeks of drought - I will do some meandering through time, summoning memories of the books and book related experiences in my life. Also, I&#39;m about to turn another year older, so I&#39;m trying to forget about that by living in the past.</p>
<p>In a manner befitting sitcom television of the 80s and 90s, the bedtime story was an established ritual in my family. Mom and sometimes Dad would read a book or two (or a portion of a book, if it was longer) to us after teeth brushing but before we&#39;d be confined to the late night prison of our room. This went on for quite a while, carried over into the lives of my younger siblings, and is still sometimes revived today. I probably appreciate it in a different light now than I did when I was younger, much the same as family meal time.</p>
<p>A lot of what was read were the usuals that all kids grow up with: Green Eggs and Ham; Goodnight Moon; Go, Dog, Go; Wynken, Blynken, and Nod; etc and so forth. I do particularly recall a set of <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sesame_Street_Library">Sesame Street books</a> that we owned, which also reminds me of the Ernie plushie I had at about that time (incidentally, my favorite character). But, I digress. There were also some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Golden_Books">Little Golden Books</a> in our library. I can still recall the taste of the foiled spines...</p>
<p>Of all the books that were ever read to me, however, there&#39;s one that stands out in my mind as being far and above the others (it also makes a great, heart warming tale to tell): the Hobbit. I don&#39;t recall exactly when this happened (general consensus places me at about 8 or 9), but my dad decided one day that we - then, Jeff, Chris, and myself - needed to experience this grande tale of adventure and theiving. I seem to recall not being enthralled by the idea of being read to initially (I was able to read at the time), but within a couple of chapters (one per night) we were all hooked. This was, of course, long before Lord of the Rings was turned into a theatrical masterpiece, but I&#39;ll be damned if my dad didn&#39;t nail Gollum&#39;s voice before it was even a thought in Andy Serkis&#39; head. This experience left such an impression on my life that I fully plan on doing the same with my own children (regardless of whether they are boys or girls).</p>
<p>Counter to that, my mom read us a few of the Little House on the Prarie books (a personal favorite series of hers). I&#39;ll be honest: there are some okay parts, but as a wild young boy, the on-goings of a girl and her family in no-man&#39;s land didn&#39;t entirely capture my attention (sorry, mom). Luckily for her, she was able to reread these to my sisters recently, who probably enjoyed them more than I did. I was able to listen in on her reading this a few times, and approaching the text with my filthy, adult mind makes for some good times (though, not so much for the person reading aloud. Again, sorry mom).</p>
<p>There are more tales to tell, I&#39;m sure (books we read in school and such), but that&#39;s the beginnings of my literacy life in a nutshell. Next time, I&#39;ll explore the world I opened of my own volition and where it&#39;s lead me today.</p>
