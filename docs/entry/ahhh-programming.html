Tryblithe, owner of <a href="http://www.ctsquare.net">CT Square</a> web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it&#39;s all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it&#39;s much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that&#39;s pretty cool :-)</p>
<p>Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that&#39;s about all there is to report there.</p>
<p>Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That&#39;s right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought &quot;Hey, this looks kind of cool&quot;. But I&#39;ve been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is &quot;We&#39;re coming soon!&quot;, &quot;Almost there...&quot;, &quot;blah blah blah...&quot;. One of their so called &quot;storez&quot; was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here&#39;s is Amazon&#39;s reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
web site.  </p>
<p>Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
their site.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, real legit :-P.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)</p>
