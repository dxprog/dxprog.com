<p>Hello. I heard from Leah yesterday. Boy did she get alot of stuff for Christmas. She obviously has a computer. Her letter was printed. By accident I found out mom&#39;s e-mail address. It&#39;s [redacted]@hotmail.com. Kinda neat! So I e-mailed her today and I&#39;M ALIVE!!! I have officially finished Excel! I made a cards program. Next is VB 5 and then DIRECTX. Thats right it&#39;s a LANGUAGE. So I will climb in the world. I&#39;ll be a top programmer at 15. Anyways gotta run. Bye![/quote]</p>
<p>We&#39;ll gloss over my erroneous comments about DirectX being a language or the fact that knowing my mother&#39;s email address at the time would&#39;ve meant certain death, and skip to the single most awesome thing I&#39;ve read in all these journal entries thus far; the bold delcaration of having &quot;officially finished Excel&quot;.</p>
<p>How does one &quot;finish&quot; Excel? Does it involve an end boss fight with pivot tables and a cell formula with many functions? Who declared this &quot;finishing&quot; official? It&#39;s true that my Excel VBA skills exceed that of your standard user (in large part because of my father), but this declaration just doesn&#39;t hold any kind of matter.</p>
<p>But, let&#39;s face it; I was also under the delusion that programming in VB and DirectX was going to make me a &quot;top programmer&quot;, and at fifteen, no less.</p>
