They were, of course, wondering what was up with the copyright claim and apologized since the production company switched between when the video was originally posted and now. The dude&#39;s name was Matt, so you know this is an an individual to be trusted.</p>
<p>Humor aside, I found working with him on the whole thing to be rather easy and pleasant. As stated above, he was apologetic, but professionally so. All he wanted was to have the video restored, all I wanted was an ask for permission and attribution. Over the course of a handful of emails, I retracted my copyright complaint, and the video reappeared on YouTube with one small change:</p>

<p>Now that this whole issue has been nicely resolved, I can finally feel that little bit of accomplishment knowing that some of my design work is being seen hundreds of thousands of people and enticing them to watch the video.</p>
<p>Really, that&#39;s pretty cool.</p>
