Not sure what I&#39;ll say at this point, but it may be more serious and brain dumpy than the usual fluff affair. Or it may not be, I dunno.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve barely even said anything over the last few months, so I guess a place to start is by catching up. I feel like my life has taken an interesting turn the last few months. Before moving to California, I was essentially the shining definition of a lone wolf. Wake up, go to work, go home. The only time I socialized with people was during those nine hours in the office. Now, however, I actively spend quite a lot of time (by my standards) away from home and doing things with other people. This evening, for example, I was at a friend&#39;s house rolling characters for an upcoming Dungeons and Dragons game, after which we played <a href="http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/">Munchkin</a>. Pretty standard social fare on paper, but as stated, kind of a big deal for me. Add to this the biking excursions, evenings of drinking, and other random outings with people and I sometimes find myself in that spot of swimming unknown waters and having to figure things out as I go. I hate being in this situation and I know it&#39;s a major reason why I shy away from dating. When I don&#39;t know the rules, everybody winds up having a bad time, or perhaps a great time at the expense of my psyche.</p>
<p>But, whatever. There&#39;s more to say, but I&#39;ll leave this here to leave fodder for the future.</p>
