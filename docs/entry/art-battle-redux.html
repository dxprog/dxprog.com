This weekend, as I was visiting my folks, we held another one. Same premise: each person chooses a picture, all three must draw said picture to the best of their ability. All laying around my iPad, the battle began.</p>

I would&#39;ve figured Joe would have this in the bag as he draws Wind Waker Link A LOT and without reference, even. But, such was not to be. As can be seen, I got a little bored waiting for everybody to finish.</p>
<p>[gallery=Steve&#39;s Pick - L from Death Note]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_control_l.jpg" alt="" title="The Control"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_joe_l.jpg" alt="" title="Joe&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_steve_l.jpg" alt="" title="Steve&#39;s Version"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/artbattle2_matt_l.jpg" alt="" title="My Version">[/gallery]
Now, I will go on record and say I didn&#39;t like the chosen picture much, but there it is. I&#39;d actually call this a three way tie because we all hit and miss aspects of the picture (there&#39;s something going on with the eyes on mine).</p>

Joe decided to sit this one out for whatever reason pretty much leaving me the winner by default. Both Steve and I quit prematurely because we were getting bored with the whole thing. I&#39;m just happy mine doesn&#39;t look &quot;lumpy&quot; and even Chris agreed.</p>
<p>So, there it is. Our second art battle with me, yet again, taking away the trophy. I think next time we should try not copying a source image and just toss out a subject to draw. It could very well level the playing field. All in good fun, though.</p>
