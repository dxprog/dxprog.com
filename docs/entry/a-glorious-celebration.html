The graph has been sitting there up at the top of my blog page slowly counting up to the grand total of 750,000. And today, one week before deadline, I have hit that total. This little exercise has added quite a bit to my life, from friendly competition with co-workers to some much needed think time. Now, to celebrate this achievement, I give you some more photos of my journeys.[break]</p>
<h2 id="signs">Signs</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of sign stuff already, but these are things I decided didn&#39;t deserve an entire rant.

See what I did there?">[/gallery]</p>
<h2 id="graffiti">Graffiti</h2>
<p>On one of my usual trails, there is a tunnel underneath a major city street. This single tunnel is home to quite a bit of interesting (and disturbing) grafitti.

One has to wonder where the other five are and if there are more...">[/gallery]</p>
<h2 id="nature-s-glory">Nature&#39;s Glory</h2>
<p>Just some photos of nature being awesome.

<h2 id="interesting-oddities">Interesting Oddities</h2>
<p>A couple things that didn&#39;t fit elsewhere.
[gallery=Walking: Oddities]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_trucks.jpg" alt="" title="A fleet of ice cream trucks. I rarely ever see a single one up in B&#39;ville, so to see an entire fleet of them whilst walking in Tulsa struck me as hilariously awesome."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_buffalo1.jpg" alt="" title="Bartlesville, in a shameless rip-off of Tulsa&#39;s penguins, has these painted buffaloes strewn about town. But this one has a surprise..."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_buffalo2.jpg" alt="" title="DISCO BALLS!">[/gallery]</p>
<p>Thus ends my pictorial report of my epic wanderings. I&#39;m thinking, perhaps, that I might film a &quot;documentary&quot; at some point, but we&#39;ll see what happens there.</p>
