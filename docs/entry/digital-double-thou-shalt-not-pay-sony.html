<p>Yeah, so I bought a PS2. For me, this is a rather huge ordeal because hating the PS2 (or anything Playstation) was like a strange sort of religion. I grew up on Nintendo, everything else was just... well... evil (though, I never had a problem with the xbox, go figure).</p>
<p>So, yeah, I bought a PS2 for Guitar Hero which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. It&#39;s kind of like DDR for your fingers, but also has some really great music to boot. From great oldies to some new stuff (like &quot;All of This&quot; by Shaimus). Currently I&#39;m making my way through hard mode which is quite a challenge (especially when the devil pinky won&#39;t cooperate).</p>
<p>I do have some more stuff in mind for my little PS2 (emphesis on the little as I got a slim). I bought the Gameshark media player for it which&#39;ll stream my videos over the network (very sweet) and, of course, I&#39;ll invest in Guitar Hero 2. And probably the Final Fantasy titles I&#39;ve missed since VI for the SNES (which will always be my favorite, though).</p>
<p>Ah, well, I got a little long winded. Guess I&#39;m enjoying this PS2 thing more than I thought I would ;-).</p>
