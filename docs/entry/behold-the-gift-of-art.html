I&#39;m thinking perhaps that an art section on the gallery page might be a good idea, but in the mean time you can enjoy it right here or on my <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt page</a>. But, I digress.
[gallery=December 2009 Art]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Midori_Kasugano.jpg" alt="" title="The colerized version of my Midori sketch from a few months back. My reference image was in black and white which left me to figure out the shading and such for this picture. That&#39;s why it looks like her hair is a lettuce leaf..."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Ryou_and_Nagisa.jpg" alt="" title="Ryou and Nagisa from the visual novel/anime CLANNAD. I suppose this could be considered bordering on yuri, in face my brother Jeff walked in as I was drawing and said &quot;That&#39;s not platonic...&quot;. It is, of course, and who should know better than the artist? Subject matter aside, I consider this a large step up in terms of coloring and shading for me, trying out some new things."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nagisa_Winter.jpg" alt="" title="Nagisa again, this time from the After Story part of CLANNAD. I have to admit that I cheated a little on this one: I didn&#39;t sketch the line art myself. I instead traced a screen grab and did all the coloring (I wanted this as a desktop wallpaper). It actually was quite the learning experience as I&#39;d not done coloring of this caliber before and I got a lot of things figured out. I hope to begin using these techniques for my own art in the near future.">[/gallery]
I hope everybody had a Merry Christmas and will have an awesome New Year!</p>
