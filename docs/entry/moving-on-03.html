We&#39;re using fancy pants digital filming technology (a fifty dollar camera) and  trial software to pull together the best Star Wars movie since Episode II (I hope). Shooting began in early April and has trudged on slowly. We have been trying to rig up camera tracks (nothing decent yet), but the one thing that _is_ done  is the lightsaber fight. It&#39;s AWESOME!!! We couldn&#39;t wait for post-production to pull that one together (it&#39;s almost all spruced up :-). We will hopefully be done with the whole thing by the end of summer. Then comes Episode VIII.</p>
