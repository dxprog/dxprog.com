This time I&#39;m doin&#39; Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the <strong>best</strong> artwork I&#39;ve ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are <strong>FIVE</strong> fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn&#39;t entirely faithful to the <a href="http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg">source material</a>, but I&#39;m really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin&#39; awesome.</p>
