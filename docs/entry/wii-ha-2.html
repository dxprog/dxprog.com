If you&#39;ve been paying attention to gaming news in the last few hours you&#39;ll know that Sony tried to pull a fast one and copy Nintendo&#39;s motion sensing stuff (a move I called a while back, sadly it wasn&#39;t on the podcast :-P). Also, you&#39;ll know that the cheapest you can get a PS3 for is $500 bucks, and that version doesn&#39;t even come with built-in wifi. I will say this only once: Sony is going to fester in their own turds this next generation.</p>
<p>But on to more current news. Next Monday we&#39;ll finally see the release of the first Mario Bros. game since Yoshi&#39;s Island (1995, I believe). From everything I&#39;ve seen this game is going to be absolutely awesome and from the reviews it seems that it lives up to standards Nintendo set back in the 80s and 90s. I have every intention of picking up my copy Monday.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s about all for now. Oh, yeah, cashiering rocks ;-). I must try to get some sleep if I expect to be awake for the press conference. Night!</p>
