Just take a look to your right and you&#39;ll see what I mean. To save having a really short post I suppose I can give a general update on what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see... I&#39;m still a cashier/cart pusher. I&#39;m enjoying Halo&#39;s online play immensely. I&#39;m almost to the floating continent on FFVI. I enjoy going to college with Elvis on the weekends, and I&#39;m thinking of moving out. Yes, you read that correctly, I&#39;m going to college with Elvis ;-).</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I am making plans for moving out of the house and into an apartment. A couple of hurdles I need to get over are lack of GED and car, but otherwise I think I&#39;m in a finacially tenable position to pull it off. Jeff also wants to move out and board with me, which would be cool. I&#39;m already dreaming of the awesome Smash Bros. game-a-thon parties I could host.... oh, yeah.</p>
