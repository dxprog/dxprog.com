Not enough to be calming, but too much to not be annoying and literally rain on Kayla and I&#39;s &quot;walk home from work&quot;, an idea we&#39;re gonnna try out to separate the line between the working day and home time. I was a bit sad about that, really...</p>
<p>Another thing I&#39;m sad/worried about and alluded to in the last post is the stock market. I guess it&#39;s more the ecomonics of everything: supply chains, companies we rely on having enough cash to keep not only their services afloat, but also their employees. I&#39;m not terribly worried about my own job, but there&#39;s a lot of blue collar folks that are going to be hard hit. Some companies are being cool, paying some amount of wages while folks are unable to work. But, that can&#39;t last forever. Unemployment is going to be through the roof and social services are ill equipped (where they exist) to handle something of that magnitude. It really sounds like Depression 2.0, and if I hadn&#39;t mentioned it before, that&#39;s what worries me the most. I have every hope and some amount of confidence that we as a people will learn some important lessons, make some important changes, and in ten years will be better off as a whole.</p>
<p>But, it&#39;s gonna be a few years of suck until we get there.</p>
<p>In other news, Nikka makes a whiskey that&#39;s aged on coffee beans or something. Has a mildly peaty aftertaste. I&#39;m enjoying that right now as I curse at the band-aid on my finger I&#39;m trying to type through. Stupid me sliced through some nail and finger as I was trying to look cool in front of my girlfriend. I feel as if my knifesmanship is the only reason she continues to date me and <em>now I&#39;ve gone and ruined everything</em>. At least I can still flippy dippy sauteeing food in a pan. Oh, I guess also my rippin&#39; pecs.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, figuring out how to keep on the exercise train while not at the office where I usually do exercise requires a little more diligence. Some folks at the work started a new daily challenge that I&#39;m going to be involved in, and I guess technically my Disney half-marathon isn&#39;t officially cancelled yet. Ultimately, I have to hold myself to getting some activity in. I know it&#39;ll be a good way to keep my spirits up; it got me out of depression once, maybe it&#39;ll keep me from going there again.</p>
<p>And if that doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s always the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSCm8yAxBr8">Auralnauts Star Wars parodies!</a></p>
