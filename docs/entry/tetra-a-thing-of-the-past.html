I&#39;ve been seeing a lot about Ajax, some fancy JScript/XML stuff that basically eliminates page loading, and I may take a shot at basing my new engine around this. Of course, it&#39;s just an idea at the moment.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;ve been starting a new game. It&#39;ll basically be a Windows version of the old strategy game, Empire. I&#39;ve been messing around with D3D8 the last couple days and I finally got all the rendering stuff done this morning (yay!).</p>
<p>In the land of house-stuffs, somebody else is coming to see the place tomorrow. We don&#39;t know the details because Dad couldn&#39;t catch much of the call (due to noisy little kids). Something about they&#39;ll call again, they&#39;re from California, blah blah blah. So we&#39;ll have to vacate again, but if it means we get that house we&#39;ve bid on, who cares :-).</p>
