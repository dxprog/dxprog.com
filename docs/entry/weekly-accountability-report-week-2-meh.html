<p><strong>Health</strong> - On the upside, I managed to keep my eating of fast food to a minimum; one trip to Taco Bell late one evening. However, the pizza that work brought in on Friday probably negates that. I&#39;ve also found out that no amount of granola bars will stave off hunger for very long. In the world of exercise, I did manage at least 45 minutes of walking every work day, no small feat considering the cold turn the weather has made. I need to add something more into the mix, though, be it treadmill, push ups, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - There were actually a couple days last week where I didn&#39;t spend any money at all. Score! The purchasing of some poster frames and a limited pressing of the <a href="http://iamshark.limitedrun.com/products/508090-star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace-ost-2xlp-limited">Episode I soundtrack on LP</a> were the only real unnecessary buys last week. I successfully did stave off the desire to purchase a couple of manga this weekend, so score. I&#39;m going to try and Scrooge it the rest of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - I did an hours worth of work two days last week. There were plenty of times I thought about picking them up later on only to take a nap instead. I have no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - Yeah...</p>
