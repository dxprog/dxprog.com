<p>Seriously, this is absolutely insane. I missed everything until now because our router decided to die leaving me without internets. So, I&#39;ve got things kind of working now, I go to check digg and there&#39;s about two pages of front page stories containing, in some way shape or form, the following hexadecimal number: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. I guess Digg got a cease and desist from the good old MP of double A and they started pulling any stories with the following string of numbers and letters: 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0. Well, people got ticked off because 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 is their favorite copy/paste fodder so they inundated the place with 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 this and 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 that and that&#39;s where it stands now. Apperantly K. Rose and Co. are allowing 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 to be shown all over the place and say that if it kills Digg that&#39;s fine since they went down with a mutha-09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 fight. Personally, if Digg goes down due to this I may start pirating ALL my movies just to let them know how pissed off I am.</p>
<p>Thanks, have a nice 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0 day.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&#39;s think for a second. Why would you have a single encryption key for EVERYTHING!? You people are stupid bastards. G&#39;Day. 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-5B-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0.</p>
