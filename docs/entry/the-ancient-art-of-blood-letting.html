Drink water, eat food, drink coffee, smack to the face, and so forth. I figured this evening, after a little bit of happy hour at work, I would work off the rest of my buzz by taking a quick bike around the trail behind the campus. So, I lifted a <a href="http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzFhL2dvb2dsZWJpa2VpLmQyVi5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/a0b00e6b/4f9/google-bike-isn-t-what-you-d-expect-75fe25b1e0.jpg">Google bike</a> and did just that. As I felt my buzz decreasing, I decided it was about time to turn around and take myself home. So, when I saw a fork coming up in the road, I figured I would gracefully arc back around.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t see is that there is a bit of a grade at this fork and road bikes don&#39;t have great traction. So, I wound up bleeding out the alcohol instead. (Don&#39;t click the break if you&#39;re not cool with the site of blood &#39;n shit.</p>

<p>This arm arguably got banged up the worst, but all of my limbs wound up with some level of scraped up. I haven&#39;t seen this much blood since my much younger years.</p>
<p>Due to probably the adrenaline rush, I was now completely sober. I biked myself back to work, did a quick patch job at the first aid station in the cafeteria, then made a trip to the store to pick up all of the first aid supplies I needed to finish the job (hint, I didn&#39;t even have so much as a band-aid at home). Luckily, those aforementioned younger years has given me quite a... CRASH COURSE in patching up wounds.</p>
