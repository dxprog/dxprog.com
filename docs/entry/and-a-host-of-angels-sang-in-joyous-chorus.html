As you can see comments and categories are back. You can&#39;t necessarily comment yet, but things are in place for it. Also archives are gone at the moment but those should be up tonight sometime. It&#39;ll be the first thing I work on after I get back from work. Until then enjoy what is and forever will be... PurpleFusion!</p>
