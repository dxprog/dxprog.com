Feels like not that long ago but also like a lifetime or two ago.</p>
<p>As I type this, I wrap up week three of working at home. I&#39;ve more or less settled into a simple routine. It follows such:</p>
<ol>
<li>Around 7-8a, begin the process of waking up. I like to wake up with cuddles, but to each their own.</li>
<li>Once awoken and cuddled, Animal Crossing commences in bed for a brief period. I&#39;ll talk more about the game later, but this is mostly to assess the situation at Nook&#39;s: hot item, turnip prices, the usual.</li>
<li>Showers and teeth and whatever generally happen afterwards and then breakfast. This week, I&#39;ve been binging on sugary cereal. Honestly, a big mistake, because I could eat an entire box in a sitting...</li>
<li>Once that ritual is done, I make a coffee and we &quot;go to work&quot;... about fifteen feet from where everything else has taken place. We generally try to start working around 8:30a, but it&#39;s pretty easy to be lazy when you don&#39;t have to contend with a morning commute. This week especially, since Kayla&#39;s on spring break, I&#39;ve been started more around 9a...</li>
<li>&quot;At work&quot;, I just work. Honestly, even though I&#39;m at my own desk in my own house, when I&#39;m in work mode, it feels like I&#39;m &quot;at&quot; work. If I&#39;ve not said it before, I&#39;m damn lucky that my job is almost entirely unaffected by this work from home world we currently live in. The lack of in person face time with my coworkers is a massive bummer, but I still get to chat with them online. This is something I&#39;m comfortable with as I&#39;ve fostered many long distance friendships entirely over chatroom.</li>
<li>Around noon, we generally break for lunch. Lately, I&#39;ve been blowing through some homemade pizza dough I&#39;ve had in the freezer for a few months. Not only is a tiny pizza for lunch cute as shit, it&#39;s also delicious. I can put whatever leftover toppings on that I want. Barbecue chicken, ranch dressing, fancy cheese, carnitas, taco sauce. I&#39;ve not had a dud yet. To go with food, Kayla and I have taken to watching an episode or two of a show or, since it came out, yet more Animal Crossing.</li>
<li>By 1p, it&#39;s back to work until 3:30-4p. A coworker of mine has setup a recurring 3p meeting for our team to talk about whatever, a digital replacement for yelling over the desk divider. I&#39;ve come to enjoy that as it adds a little bit of spice and levity to the isolation.</li>
<li>After work, we try to get in some sort of outside time. Walks, bike rides, running after Kayla while she bike rides, these have all been done. I&#39;m super comfortable with walking, so if I&#39;m off on my own, I try to push the mileage and speed up. It&#39;s cathartic and adds in that nice break that otherwise would have been the commute back from the office.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, it&#39;s more or less business as usual. Make dinner, play Animal Crossing, watch a show, play Animal Crossing, eat ice cream and probably play Animal Crossing at the same time.</p>
<p>...gonna have to write about Animal Crossing in my next post, methinks...</p>
<p>Really, that just reads as any old day, as far as a weekday goes. The only real difference is lack of travel and location. And I like it that way; helps keep my context of what needs to be done properly framed.</p>
<p>We have also formed a little bit of routine for the weekend. Generally on Saturday, we&#39;ll make a run to the store for groceries, per usual. The stock levels in stores has <em>mostly</em> levelled out, though TP still proves to be elusive. Actually being in the stores is a little weird, being much emptier than usual and, thus, quieter. Makes it a little eerie, especially with people largely avoiding each other and walking around with masks (which only feels weird being America; I got pretty used to seeing the masks in my trips to Japan). We also use this time out to &quot;eat out&quot;, meaning grab take out from some fast food type establishment. It&#39;s the only real outing we have during the week as far as going to social centers is concerned.</p>
<p>Outside activity is generally on the plate for the weekend, as well. I guess we&#39;ve gone on a hike once... okay, I think that may have been it. And I swear, it was much harder social distancing on that hike than it&#39;s been at any store due to the amount of people. Even the house park has seen a massive uptick in folks wandering around, that I&#39;ve noticed. It&#39;s good to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a long ass post. This is pretty much going to be my life for the weeks to come as I don&#39;t see people being allowed to re-emerge for another couple months. And then we&#39;ll probably have to do it again when the second wave of infections starts...</p>
<p>...man, I miss Disneyland...</p>
