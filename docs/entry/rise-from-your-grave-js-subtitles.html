<p>It&#39;s that time of week again! Now, <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/rise-from-your-grave-chainploder/">last week</a> I made an allusion that there wouldn&#39;t be many more new or non-VB projects. Well, this is week defies that in both that this is something pretty recent (this year) and not VB (JavaScript, in this case).</p>
<p>You are certainly well aware of the so-called <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/">Music Page</a>. What most people are not aware of is that there has been a video counterpart to it for almost as long, though its development has been far slower. In its original incarnations, the video page was a way for my bros and I to watch shows across the interwebs while I was in college. Now-a-days, it acts as simple front-end for VLC running on my server. But, streaming is certainly in the plans for it yet.</p>
<p>That in mind, I had begun playing around with the webm codec when it was released for this purpose. However, one naggling issue was that a good chunk of my content is in foreign language (I&#39;ll let you guess which one) and ffmpeg is not capable of burning on subtitles. I did a little research around, but ultimately decided that I would just write my own subtitle parser on the front end player - i.e. parsing and displaying SRT formatted subtitles with JavaScript using HTML.</p>
<p>This is arguably pretty easy (the basics of the format are very human readable) and I had a working implementation within about a day. The largest hurdle was getting the timing correct and finding a display format for the font that would allow it to be readable without going old school closed captions style and blocking out the video behind (I settled on a soft yellow with a CSS3 drop shadow). There is some rudimentary support for subtitle position animation, but little else. I would love to get some of the fancier animation stuff implemented as there are many anime that script the karaoke portion of the OP/ED to nice effect.</p>
<p>You can check the subtitles test page here: [ <a href="http://dxprog.com/labs/subtitles/">JavaScript Subtitles</a> ].
You&#39;ll need an HTML5 compliant browser that supports h.264 (Chrome, Safari or IE9 at this point). Also, all the source is in the one file, so just do &quot;view source&quot; in your browser and there it is.</p>
<p>Next week I promise there will be VB goodness!</p>
