Of course, that&#39;s a mouthful of words right there so their brilliant marketing team reduced it down to &quot;bogo&quot;. However, when spelled back out it&#39;s Buy One Get One which is clearly a lie. It should be &quot;bogoho&quot;, but then I guess it sounds like some black guy ordering his prositutes around. Yo! Bo go, ho!</p>
