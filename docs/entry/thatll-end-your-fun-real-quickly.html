This after dark guilt ride is something that happens entirely too frequently. But, that&#39;s beside the point.</p>
<p>Before I even get out the door, I was looking for my pump to top my tires off. How something that large can go completely missing is beyond me, but after a solid 10-15 minutes of looking, it was nowhere to be found. So, I decided to just live with the pressure at whatever it was and go. Get outside, start Strava and my music, hop on the saddle, clip in, and away I go... except I don&#39;t. As I&#39;m rounding the corner towards the apartment exit, I realize I&#39;m not wearing my helmet. Return home, grab helmet, rinse and repeat. I&#39;m finally on the road.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m out biking, listening to some tunes and giving my new bike undies a test run. My outfit is said undies, a pair of gym shorts, and my Lockheed-Martin jersey (it has pockets which is handy for holding my hand pump). My ass was comfortable for sure, though there&#39;s not enough padding in the crotch. Probably too much information, but there it is.</p>
<p>Again, I&#39;m out biking and not really taking any particular direction. Up over a bridge, under an overpass, around Fry&#39;s and to a side road that takes me past the rock climbing place. This drops me out on a road that goes by the Sunnyvale LinkedIn complex. Had I brought my badge, I could have stopped in and raided the pantry, but I didn&#39;t so I didn&#39;t. As I&#39;m making a left out of that building and onto the road, I hear a loud &quot;pop&quot; behind me. I didn&#39;t need to inspect the bike to know what had happened; I&#39;d been struck by the Curse of Jibjab.</p>
<p>One of my coworkers (well, technically two) have the same bike that I do. He blew a spoke on that bike not once, but twice, on the same wheel even. I pulled myself over to the sidewalk, flipped my bike over and began inspecting every spoke on the wheel. Lo and behold, a spoke has been sheared off.</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m somewhere on the order of 2-3 miles away from home. I briefly consider my options and decide that, despite the fact that wheel won&#39;t even spin freely anymore, it&#39;s good enough under load to make it home. I wasn&#39;t really keen to the idea of walking that far back in my biking shoes.</p>
<p>So, I slow rode all the way back, worrying the entire time that my immense weight was going to crush the rest of the spokes. Luckily, it went by without incident. I suppose all in all this isn&#39;t such a bad ordeal as I was planning on replacing the wheels with something better anyways, but I don&#39;t really like being forced into these situations.</p>
<p>Fate, however, has its own plans.</p>
