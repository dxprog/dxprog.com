The first phase of the brackets always sucks because it means a lot of tedious labor for me.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consists of people nominating the characters they&#39;d like to see make it to the actual voting. This year, I put a lot of additional rules in place, limiting the time span from which somebody could enter a character. This was done to give new characters a fighting change, keep things fresh, and also (hopefully) shrink the pool.</p>
<p>Well, that didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>As of me writing this, three days into the seven day long nomination period, there have been over 1500 nominations. I have had to go through each and every one of those and, for the <a href="http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-girls-bracket/characters/">830 nominees that were eligible and not duplicates</a>, clean up the name and create a thumbnails. A few things have made this slightly easier this year than last.</p>
<ul>
<li>Better admin tools</li>
<li>A requirement that the user provide an image of the character so I don&#39;t have to go hunting for one</li>
<li>A type-ahead field that pulls data from <a href="http://myanimelist.com">MyAnimeList</a> that will prefill character name, media source, and image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MAL images always come in a 225x350 size, so I&#39;ve gotten the cropping down to muscle memory; I can complete an entrants record in under 10 seconds. Which is good, because even at ten seconds per, that&#39;s over two hours of solid work. But, the average is much higher because I still sometimes need to find a better picture, figure out if the character is eligible if I&#39;m not familiar with the source, etc and so forth. I&#39;ve probably put five to six hours into just cropping those fucking pictures.</p>
<p>But, still, I&#39;m happy with the turn out. To give you a bit of comparison, last year when there were no restricting rules, there were a total of 797 nominations of which 473 made it into the elimination rounds. I suspect part of that is due to the fact that this bracket is starting out with the traction we had at the end of the last one. But also, a lot of people are just nominating every female character from their favorite shows, regardless of how much actual screen time they may have had. I personally think this is a silly approach because only 256 characters will make it to the actual bracket and those will all be the heavy hitter characters. I mean, who seriously thinks that <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/z4.jpg">this</a> will win against <a href="http://cdn.awwni.me/bracket/ln.jpg">this</a> on a battle based upon cuteness?</p>
<p>Not me, that&#39;s for sure.</p>
