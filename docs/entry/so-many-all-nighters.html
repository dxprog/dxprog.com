I am currently at Orlando International where I await the departure of my flight at 6:23am, a little less than six hours from now. I was hoping to walk in here, dump off my luggage, and get through security right off the bat. However, good old Northwest Airlines has, yet again, left me with an unmanned counter. So, I am stuck with my twenty pound bag of clothing and vigilantly watching for the first signs of life at the counter.</p>
<p>Once again I have finished another two courses at Full Sail. This time was Design and Art Theory (DAT) and College Math (CMD) which was basically an Algebra course.</p>
<p>DAT was alright; it was essentially a traditional art course with design centric properties. Not being able to use my computer was difficult for me especially because pencils and paper don&#39;t have the Ctl+Z option. If you screw up, you&#39;ve screwed up. Congratulations. However, I did pump out some decent stuff which I will show to you now.</p>

This is my fice piece still life. I pushed it a little bit by counting the drum sticks as seperate objects, but meh. It went ungraded anyways (as did most things in that class).</p>

This is the only piece I am truly proud of. I don&#39;t really have much to say aside from it was painted with acrylics on canvas and it was my first time doing any painting outside of using Crayola watercolors. The colors are a little dark because mixing paints is a bitch.</p>
<p>I did do several other pieces, but I don&#39;t have pictures of them and seeing as I&#39;m at the airport I won&#39;t be taking pictures anytime soon.</p>
<p>Nothing really to report on about math because that&#39;s exactly what it was. What is sweet, though, is that I may pull an A out of that class which would thrill me to no end as I thought math was my suckiest subject.</p>
<p>So, there&#39;s my month on a nutshell. I&#39;ll probably post again once I&#39;m in ol&#39; Bartlesville. Until then, keep on peacin&#39; out!</p>
