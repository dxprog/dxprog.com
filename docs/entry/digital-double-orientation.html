<p>Sorry for it being late. I&#39;m now on Linux and I&#39;ve yet to get my scanner or wacom working so making comics is a going to be a little complicated until I do.</p>
<p>Not much to say about the comic, so I won&#39;t.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try to update again on Friday. I have some scans that I can  use until I get everything working the way they&#39;re supposed to.</p>
<p>P.S. Comments are working again. I&#39;m just letting wordpress handle it all since I&#39;ve got more spam squashing options there.</p>
