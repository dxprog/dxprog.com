In an interesting twist of fate, both of those countries started with the letters &quot;JA&quot; (the only two in the world, even). They are worlds apart, however, both in physical distance and atmosphere/culture. Let&#39;s do a pros/cons.</p>
<p><em>## Japan</em>
<strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody is very respectful of others and mostly keep to themselves. The introvert in me loves this.</li>
<li>It&#39;s clean. Though some places may look a little run down, the overall level of cleanliness is pretty high</li>
<li>Shit is organized. There were a couple of times when the road to Asakusa was blocked for utility work or something and they had cones marking precisely how traffic was now being directed... and also a friendly guy there to point you in the right direction.</li>
<li>Conversion rate is essentially 1JPY = 0.01USD. Makes for easy conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Probably contrary to the cleanliness bit, there was a constant smell of old garbage/water mold lingering around. It was only in certain spots, but it was a trifle off putting.</li>
<li>Cramped. The trains, the layout of the buildings, etc is designed to pack the most stuff into the smallest space. Not great for my introversion and large body.</li>
<li>Language barrier. They <em>really</em> don&#39;t speak English well when they do at all.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>## Jamaica</em>
<strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The resorts are such that you really never need to leave; all your whims are attended to</li>
<li>The beach</li>
<li>The exchange rate for the Jamaican dollar is about 1JMD = 0.01USD. Granted, you may as well just use American money because it&#39;s less likely to depreciate in value and everybody takes it anyways.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It may seem like everybody is super friendly, but it&#39;s that kind of friend that stops paying attention to you when they find out you&#39;re not popular/don&#39;t have money/etc. Money gets you everywhere.</li>
<li>The food will make you shit... a lot and explosively. If you&#39;re wise, you&#39;ll pull a Steven Spielberg and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark#Filming">bring your own food</a>.</li>
<li>The Jamaicans running the tourist stuff are essentially parodies of the stereotype. So much &quot;mon&quot;, Bob Marley, and general &quot;no shits given&quot; (the above shits excepting) were way, way overused. Also, my brand of &quot;fun&quot; and theirs are very different, but they&#39;ll try to force it on you anyways. Granted, I&#39;ve had friends try to get me involved in such activities as well. Looking at you, dancing...</li>
<li>Jamaica is a third world country. Outside the fancy resorts and tourist spots, it&#39;s really fucking run down and the people are super poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the battle of J countries, Japan is the obvious victor (though, my opinion is certainly heavily biased).</p>
