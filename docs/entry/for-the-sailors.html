Should your mouth perpetually have a bar of soap strapped to it? Well then you&#39;re reading the right column. Hi, I&#39;m Dr. Matt.</p>
<p>Over the last three years my team and I have come up with a simple solution to all swearing problems. It is a simple matter of appended or prepending letters or phrases onto said bad word to make it kid friendly. Let&#39;s have an example:</p>
<p> &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t sound very nice, does it? Now let&#39;s see the same phrase after applying Dr. Matt&#39;s pateneted cuss removing technology.</p>
<p> &quot;What the shell is that?!&quot;</p>
<p>Much nicer, no? The following table contains a list of beautified words that you can use any day in front of anybody (except the pope): </p>
<p>bass
mustard
witch/itch
ship
crab
freak/frickin&#39; (funk has also been suggested, but that burders too close...)</p>
<p>In certain situations a letter won&#39;t work and you will actually have to say the word, however, after much research it was found that the word &quot;Hoover&quot; can aleviate sid problem. Examples:</p>
<p>Hoover Dam
sucks like a Hoover</p>
<p>Ans there you have it. Practice these steps everyday and you&#39;ll be on the road to verbal maturity in no time. Have a great day :-)</p>
