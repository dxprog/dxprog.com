My first task: create the site wide search. Now, bear in mind that this was my first time really doing anything in PHP and search is quite a big thing. Ask Google. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d back me up.</p>
<p>Today, some eight years later, I have implemented site search into my website. Of course, it&#39;s running circles around my original code in terms of complexity, speed and even the amount of lines it&#39;s implemented in (340 v 70).</p>
<p>Here are some of the fun things the new search can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searches through all content types and each type can display differently in search results</li>
<li>All searches are weighted against where the terms were matched. The algorithm is such: (matches in title <em> 10) + (matched tags </em> 5) + matches in body</li>
<li>As with all aspects of my site, the search has a RESTful interface so I could make an ajaxy instant search if I so desired</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some good queries to show off what it can do:</p>
<p><a href="http://dxprog.com/search/rock%20band/">Rock Band</a> - Example where weighting really helps
<a href="http://dxprog.com/search/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> - Example of different document types</p>
<p>btw, if you wanted to see the old partyfish search code, <a href="http://dxprog.com/files/search.txt">here you go.</a> The new search stuff will be added to the repository shortly and I&#39;ll be making that public very soon.</p>
