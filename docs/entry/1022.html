Whatevs. Not much has been happening that&#39;s worth talking about or that I can talk about (NDA and all). Until today, that is.</p>
<p>When I woke up terribly sick.</p>
<p>Normally, I know when I&#39;m getting sick the night before, but not this time. I woke this morning and started thinking that something didn&#39;t feel right. Snooze the alarm, attempt to sleep for another nine minutes. But I don&#39;t as I&#39;m assessing the situation. Then it hits me: I feel sick. Well, that&#39;s not right. I get sick the night before; I should have known this is coming. My body, however, apparently had other plans. Alarm goes off again and I&#39;m lying there deciding if I should go to work where we&#39;re currently in crunch time or stay home. I decide the latter and text the boss my physical and work status. I throw my phone on the floor and attempt to get rest.</p>
<p>But the weight of deadlines prevents me from getting much actual rest. I have a weird fever dream where I&#39;m on a date eating hotdog ice cream. Well, kind of. It&#39;s actually a hotdog in an ice cream cone with a cone of chocolate on top. My date throws her cone on the ground and then proceeds to steal food from a good truck. I&#39;m flabbergasted and am about to tell her off when I realize... this can&#39;t be real. Sure enough, it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>So, I get up, drink some juice and pop out the work laptop. After about an hour-ish of work, my body feels like it&#39;s actually going to start falling apart at the seams. So, I abandon work and crash on the couch figuring now would be a perfect time to catch up on the animus that I&#39;ve not been watching lately. One episode each of Girls&#39; Monthly Nozaki-kun, Hanayamata, and Sword Art Online later, I decide I should try to get some more work done. But, the 12 foot journey from my couch to my computer makes me realize that my health has actually declined in the time since I&#39;d last been over there. I IM the boss my status and that this is the end of me, grab abother Advil and OJ, then head back to the couch.</p>
<p>Where I proceed to watch ten more episodes of Sword Art.</p>
<p>The show isn&#39;t bad, certainly better than the second half of season 1. However, I can&#39;t help but notice that Kirito is coming to rescue yet another damsel in PTSD distress. Fuck having strong female protagonists in that show; I just don&#39;t think the author has it in him to keep his initially strong females that way. Also, there are so many ass and taint shots of the main female character. Which is okay, I guess...</p>
<p>But, this isn&#39;t about SAO, it&#39;s about me being sick. As I&#39;m watching all these episodes, I&#39;m toying with the idea of getting a pizza. And get a pizza I do. It arrives ~40 minutes later and I chow down as I finish watching SAO. The pizza makes me feel a bit better, having filled the void in my stomach. And then sleepy.</p>
<p>I crawl into my bed where I try to get cool enough to fall asleep. It must have been successful, because the next thing I know the sun has gone down and the clock reads five hours later. I finish up the orange juice (which I am now sadly missing) and lie down on the the couch where I&#39;ve basically ever since, power watching Fairly Odd Parents and Hey, Arnold!. At some point during that mess, I remembered that I have a thermometer. Curious, I take my temperature.</p>
<p>100.4</p>
<p>Well, that seems a bit high. I&#39;ve been taking my temp a few times since, coming up with everything from 100 to 102.2. If I wasn&#39;t sure before, there&#39;s solid numerical evidence that I am pretty goddamn sick.</p>
<p>I wonder what tomorrow will bring...</p>
