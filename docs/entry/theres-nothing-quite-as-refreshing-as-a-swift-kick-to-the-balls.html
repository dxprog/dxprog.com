I haven&#39;t really put it out anywhere, but I&#39;ve had a <a href="http://dxprog.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> account for some time now. Like, almost a year. I put up some of my Matt (Digital Double) redesigns and promptly forgot about it. Well, since I&#39;ve been drawing all this stuff lately I&#39;ve been posting again and garnering some attention. Attention like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Dude, you don&#39;t have enough pageviews for the time you&#39;ve been to DA and the quality of your stuff. I&#39;ve only been here for a few weeks and I have more than triple your pageviews, it&#39;s annoying. Do more art! I less than three your style. = P&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s like a kick to the balls and at the same time it&#39;s nice. He obviously thinks highly of my artwork, but the whole &quot;d00d! I&#39;m teh n00b and teh p0puler and you teh arnt&quot; hurts slightly. He (I assume it&#39;s a guy) does have a point that I need to more art. One thing that baffles me, though, is that last sentence. The world may never know...</p>
