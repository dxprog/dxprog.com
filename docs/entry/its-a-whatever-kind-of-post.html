I&#39;ve just returned from a team bonding exercise, aka going out to bar and having drinks and conversation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is election day, and dear god will I be happy for that to be over. The previous election seasons have been a bit of a shit show, but this year takes the fucking cake. My voting has already been taken care of, thanks to the mail in ballot, which is probably the best way to vote. I was able to sit down for an hour or so and, while I was filling out my ballot, research all the various questions, what they were really introducing, and make an informed decision about my vote.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just for the state propositions. I skipped most of the &quot;position&quot; votes because I don&#39;t care or am not informed enough (even with that research), save for two:</p>
<p>I voted for Hillary, because I feel she&#39;s just going to be status quo. Not only that, but I can&#39;t pretend to stand behind my morals and cast a vote for Trump. Unlike my father who, despite years of decrying the man, will vote for him regardless because it&#39;s a vote for his team, which has lost in the last two elections. That&#39;s all it boils down to for him, and I clearly disagree in this regard. Though I don&#39;t think Trump would have enough political power or clout to do the heinous things he&#39;s talked about, I&#39;m not about to sully what&#39;s left of my soul by backing the man (party affiliation be damned).</p>
<p>The other position I voted for was a write in. Why? Because there were only two options to vote fore: the one guy that was on there, or whomever I pleased. So I voted for my friend <a href="http://cmimg.dxprog.com/cm_20060430_1.png">devbus</a>. because it clearly doesn&#39;t matter how that vote goes.</p>
<p>I suppose this was slightly more than a &quot;whatever&quot; post, but scrolling through my Facebook feed gave me the ire to talk about how much I&#39;m sick of this goddamned election, much like I&#39;m sick of it every year it happens. I&#39;m ready for things to go back to normal.</p>
<p>Whatever that is...</p>
