As for the cards themselves, I&#39;m really pleased.</p>

<p>However, the background leaves a lot to be desired. Putting it against a solid color loses the energy that I&#39;ve got going to the landing page and, in the end, just looks empty. There&#39;s not enough content here to fill up all that empty space. So, I tried playing around with the layout some.</p>

<p>Not really satisfied with any of those. Perhaps I should take a photo that has less going on, something that could be centered more. Or perhaps I rework the cards themselves to fill more space on the page.</p>
<p>I dunno, back to pushing pixels.</p>
