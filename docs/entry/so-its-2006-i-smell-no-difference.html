I smell no difference</h2><time>January 1, 2006</time><div><p>Ah, the new year has arrived and with it a job change for me. That&#39;s right I achieved my life long dream and got a part time job at the Sizzler! No, really. I am now a cashier at Wal-mart. I originally wanted to be a cart pusher because cashier was something I wanted to be even less. There was a bit of confusion for a while because I told Debbie (schedule lady) I didn&#39;t really like cashiering and I&#39;d rather be a cart pusher. My guess is she misunderstood, got it reversed and set things in motion for me to become a cashier (they even changed my job code to cart pusher so they could change it to cashier which had me even more confused). But tonight was my first night working the register (being watched, of course) and it wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought it&#39;d be. I have tomorrow and Tuesday off so that makes things even sweeter.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tuesday there&#39;s bowling again (thank heavens)! Now that I have a job I appreciate the bowling night even more than I did before. Tomorrow Mom and I are going to go to Tulsa and do some shopping. I&#39;ve got $50+ dollars of spending money ($300 if I borrowed from savings, but that&#39;s college money now). I&#39;m thinking of buying Yoshi&#39;s Island or Mairo World (if I can find it :-P). I&#39;ve even tossed the idea of getting a DS and Mario Kart DS around, but my laptop is cool enough for me at the moment ;-).</p>
<p>But, now that I&#39;ve rambled on long enough, I bid you all a happy new year. 2005 was quite an eventful year for me and 2006 will probably bring some interesting things. Stay here for the latest :-)</p>
