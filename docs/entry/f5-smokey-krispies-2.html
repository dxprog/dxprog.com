<p>This is one thing I&#39;ve never understood: Why the heck does Smokey Bear wear jeans and no shirt? He&#39;s a bear for crying out loud, he can run around nude :-P. Or if you&#39;re going to clothe <em>half</em> of him, why not the other half? IIRC, 20th Centruy Fox wanted to do the same thing to Chewie.... idiots :-P</p>
