I will be moving on to bigger and better things at Winnercomm, doing web work for the Outdoor Channel it seems. At least it comes with a significant raise and the title of &quot;web developer.&quot;</p>

One of my co-workers celebrated her five year anniversary, so the rest of the team decked out her desk in crazy amounts of streamers (in secret, of course).</p>

One of the last major projects I was to undertake was an overhaul of our SharePoint project management stuff. This was me trying to figure out how to make SP intuitive and not ugly. Not an easy task.</p>

The parting image I left on my whiteboard. Many of my co-workers are indeed jelly, and I do not blame them.</p>
