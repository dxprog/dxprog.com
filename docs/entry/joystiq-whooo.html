Whooo!</a></h1><time class="post__published">July 23, 2006</time></header><div class="post__content"><p>It seems my comic has finally gained a little bit of recognition. That&#39;s right, I was featured on this week&#39;s <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/22/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-16-22-2006">webcomic pick of the week</a> poll on <a href="http://www.joystiq.com">Joystiq</a>. Not only that, however, but people actually commented on it (see comments 11-13, 12 is my favorite). Now, I can&#39;t brag too much because Chris has been on <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/10/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-june-4-10-2006/">there</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/15/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-9-15-2006/">twice</a>. Still, it&#39;s a pretty awesome feeling to be noticed on one of the internet&#39;s biggest game news sites. Anyhoo, since I&#39;ll be having guests I&#39;ve gone through all the trouble of pulling together the RSS feed for the comic (use the icon above, or IE7&#39;s handy little dropdown box).</p>
