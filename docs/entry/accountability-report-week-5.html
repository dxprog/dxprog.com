However, I have done well on resisting the urge for the most part. I did line up a couple things for pre-order and have settled on the number of $50/mo to satisfy my urge to purchase Japanese items. Also, unbeknownst to me, Amazon decided that they would charge me for Prime without notice once my trial had ended. Now I have Prime. Generally when it comes to online ordering, I trade patience for money and go with the cheapest shipping option, but I guess that&#39;s moot now. Also, I&#39;ll probably be purchasing from Amazon instead of rightstuf just so I can somewhat justify the money they have taken from me. I did do some spontaneous &quot;gifting&quot; of things last week, which was some money gone not planned. That shouldn&#39;t, however, become anything regular.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - Lackluster week on the exercise front. I did not get out for the usual afternoon walks as often as I should have which also caused Mr. Helton to pull ahead of me in steps. I&#39;m putting my foot down on that this week (get it?). I&#39;ve still managed to stay away from most fast food, a trip to Cici&#39;s with my family notwithstanding. Interestingly, I haven&#39;t even had the urge for the late night McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell trip. Or even to go there at all. I&#39;ve done my best to have <em>something</em> hanging around the house for when those urges occur, usually in the form of some kind of sandwich. Or delicious bread pudding. It&#39;s not good for me, but at least it&#39;s not processed, right?</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Not too much new here. I did get <a href="http://kanacards.us">Kanacards</a> to a (mostly) usable state and have been doing vocab drills with that. There&#39;s still some development to go to make it full featured and sand down the rough edges, but it can and shall be used. The most difficult thing I&#39;m finding, however, is that my Genki book is a text book but there&#39;s no syllabus to go with it. So, I&#39;m trudging along as best I can.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing</strong> - I hooked my Wacom back up to my computer at some point this week.</p>
