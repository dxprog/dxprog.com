I was reading through old entries last night and I feel that things may be beginning to get empty. So, here I am once again poring forth my soul into the void that is known as the internet.</p>
<p>Last month ended my two month journey that was motion graphics. I am sad to have to leave these classes as I seem to have found my calling in mograph. To be frank, I had way too much fun and I probably created my best work ever in those two months. Of course, just because I&#39;m not in the class doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be dropping it and forgetting about it. No, I plan on doing small projects through out school that I can dump into my demo reel down. Even now I am working on a small advertisement for a friend. After that, there&#39;s a Dockers &quot;make your commercial and have it aired on TV&quot; contest that I&#39;m thinking of entering. The more I can get my work out there, the more chance I have of going immediately into the industry after I graduate.</p>
<p>But enough dwelling on the past (or the future), and let us reflect on the present. This month I have probably what is going to be the easiest class off all time: web development. For anybody who doesn&#39;t know me personally, I&#39;ve been involved in web dev for going on eight years. All that YPN stuff and what not. Of course, for those of us who are already fluent in web dev they&#39;re going to try to get us to use modern and clean coding practices (tableless design, emphasis on CSS, etc). Oh, wait. I already do all that. I feel like a jerk talking about this class like it&#39;s useless crap, but it&#39;s really not their fault. However, I don&#39;t want to be talked down to as if I know nothing or am new to the whole web stuff. As with most technologies I&#39;ve taught myself, I not only learn forwards, but backwards as well. I&#39;m well versed in tricks of old as well as new. Alright, enough of that borderline ego stroking.</p>
<p>My other class, which I haven&#39;t actually attended yet, is, or will be, developmental psychology. I really don&#39;t know what this class has in store for me, but at the very least it should be more interesting than web dev.</p>
<p>Today, I got to get my feet wet in the field of game testing. EA&#39;s Tiburon division, which develops most of their sports titles, resides just seven small miles from my house. Once or twice a month they bring people in to do a couple hours of game beta testing in exchange for a free game. I&#39;ve been on the mailing list since December after Ian Cummings, lead director of the Madden series, put in a recommendation for me after reading my Rock Band drums post. Of course, that was for a full-time job doing game testing, but being a full-time student as well these two hours sessions were the next best thing. But, I digress.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got to go to the EA building, which I must say is very, very nice looking. I even got to sign a non-disclosure agreement that forbids me from telling anybody what I played or what I saw. Kind of cool, actually. I will say, I enjoyed what I played and the best part of all is I obtained myself a free copy of Command &amp; Conquer 3 for PC. I haven&#39;t actually installed or tried the game yet, but I&#39;ll probably post something when I do.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that about wraps things up for now. I&#39;ll be putting up a post about my final project for motion graphics soon (currently waiting on something). Oh, and for all those tiny little updates be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dxprog">Twitter account</a>. I&#39;ve also placed a convenient little box above the RSS feeds that shows my latest tweet. Until next time, keep your staplers running.</p>
