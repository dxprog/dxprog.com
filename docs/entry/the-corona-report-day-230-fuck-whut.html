That I at least partially seriously believed I could pump out a pandemic related post per day until the whole thing was over is laughable at this point. At that point, the relevance of masks hadn&#39;t been figured out and the global death count was likely lower than where the States is right now. Jesus.</p>
<p>So, yeah. It&#39;s been over half a year since my last post and, at this point, living in pandemic world is just normal life. You wear a mask when you go out, you work from from home and don&#39;t really see your friends anymore, and you wait and watch with trepidation to see what the next thing that&#39;s going to open up will be. As of this writing, the Bay Area has some dining (indoor and out) open as well as theaters and some outdoor rec. This is nice, because it allows Kayla and I some respite from the house once every other week or so. It feels weird at best and wrong at worst to be going out and doing these things, but I feel we&#39;re taking the right level of precaution to keep ourselves and others safe. Words I may eat later, but there it is.</p>
<p>But, 2020 has now become a bit of a meme, and if you thought that the Great COVID-19 Pandemic was the only thing going on, you&#39;d be quite wrong. Over the summer, there were the protests (most non-violent, but also the ones that were) over police brutality that finally put some things into perspective for me. The lightning storm I delighted in one morning turned out to be the literal spark that caught the areas around us on fire, including the areas around where Kayla&#39;s parents live, so that was a thing that needed to be handled. And, of course, in the middle of all of this, it&#39;s an election year, which has been occupying more time in my brain than I&#39;d honestly like it to.</p>
<p>Prior to 2016, I stayed away from politics as much as I possibly could. I even laid out my grand vision for &quot;not voting is a vote&quot; to somebody on a date that year which, in retrospect, looks mighty ignorant on my part. But after watching those in power demonstrate that they are actually an evil movie villain and the people who blindingly worship said people, I feel a real and genuine fear. Around the last presidential election, I got into a spirited debate with one of my best friends about what a corrupt president could <em>actually</em> do, myself taking the side of &quot;checks and balances will keep the ship sailing in mostly the correct direction.&quot; Over the last four years, I&#39;ve watched those checks and balances be side stepped or strong armed into doing the bidding of an individual and then that individual creating social unrest among those who worship him based on the color of his flag. It&#39;s basically destroyed what trust I had in our government&#39;s core structure and I yearn for what we had before or, at least, what I perceived we had. But, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s going to take a very very long time to weed through that. And god knows what&#39;s going to happen on election day and the days immediately following...</p>
<p>In lighter news, I&#39;m getting married. That&#39;s kind of a big deal. Of course, planning a wedding in the middle of a big &#39;ol pandemic is an interesting thing. We&#39;ve met very few folks face to face, missed out on any wedding fairs, and are basically laying out concrete plans knowing that everything might backslide and we&#39;ll have an event nobody can attend. Still, you get an appreciation for the art of pulling together such an event and it makes me realize what an ungrateful asshole I probably came off as to the various weddings I&#39;ve attended... But, our wedding will be great. Outside of legally binding myself to the person I love most in the world, it&#39;ll be cutely decorated with a million DIY projects we&#39;re currently pulling together and, of course, a full bar. There won&#39;t be too many guests, which is good because pandemic, but it&#39;ll be a great group of people and I&#39;m excited to party with them and celebrate a life milestone that, for a while, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d actually achieve.</p>
<p>It seems my glass of gin and tonic has emptied and, so too, the words that I&#39;m going to write in this post. It&#39;s really hard to summarize all the things that have happened between now and my early April posts because it&#39;s a fluid future we&#39;re moving through. I think once we get past Tuesday and whatever shenanigans come from that, I&#39;ll be a little better. Depending on how it goes, of course.</p>
<p>Worse comes to worse, Animal Crossing is still there for me.</p>
