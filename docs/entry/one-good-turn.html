Among these was a <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2015/02/february-five-favorites-edition/">favorites list</a>. Noticing that she had added a row for video games, I snarkily suggested she should have &quot;favorite TNG character&quot;. To her credit, she devoted the <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2015/02/february-five-12/">entire next post</a> to the topic of Next Generation. It&#39;s moments like these when I consciously consider the fact that my mom has a bit of a nerdy streak which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>But, enough of that, given that she went through the trouble of constructing that list, I feel it&#39;s only right that I do the same. So, following her parameters, here is mine:</p>
<p><strong>1. Favorite Character</strong> - Gonna have to go with Picard on this one. How can you not respect the guy who is essentially a role model for humanity? Following closely behind would be Q, Data, and Riker (in no particular order).</p>
<p><strong>2. Favorite Episode</strong> - Much to my mom&#39;s chagrin, I can&#39;t not give this award to <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_%28episode%29">Cause and Effect</a>. I believe it&#39;s been mentioned before, but I love time travel stories and time loops in particular are a guilty pleasure of mine. On a funny aside, the first Google result for &quot;enterprise keeps exploding&quot; is the Wiki entry for this episode.</p>
<p><strong>3. Least Favorite Character</strong> - You thought I was going to say Pulaski, didn&#39;t you mother? Well, despite the fact that I cannot stand her elitist attitude and the way she treats data, she&#39;s only number two in that regard. No, this coveted award goes to Tasha Yar, the overly emotional, too bull-headed security officer that preceded Worf. Her death is one of the shining moments of the series.</p>
<p><strong>4. Favorite Doctor</strong> - I don&#39;t have much to say about Lwaxana Troi (though, I do enjoy the episodes she&#39;s in), but I do have words for the various doctors in the series, my favorite being (drumroll) the Doctor! Sure, the actual TV series only had Pulaski and Crusher (of two, I prefer the latter), but the good ol&#39; EMH makes a wonderful yet brief appearance in First Contact making him eligible for this list. You can&#39;t not love his dickish, self-serving attitude and, as a main character on Voyager, was given much more time to be fleshed out as a character.</p>
<p><strong>5. On the topic of Q</strong> - Who doesn&#39;t love Q? He&#39;s such an asshole, but a highly entertaining one (see above about the Doctor). Q episodes always tend to bring out the more interesting topics, such as &quot;how would you relive your life given the chance&quot;? He also introduced the Borg, which is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Okay, I have geeked out about Trek for long enough. I should run to the store to pick up ingredients for turkey soup. Should be a hoppin&#39; good time.</p>
