YAY! No, seriously, it&#39;s only coming to DVD ;-)</p>
<p>May 6th, as I predicted, I will be back at the old register again. Thank goodness :-P. My sleep &quot;schedule&quot; as of late has been so screwed it&#39;s not funny. Also, I have yet to take the driving test. Tuesday and Wednesday I slept right through 7am and Thursday I spent my entire 15 minute break trying to ge through, to no avail :-P. So I&#39;m going to try again this week and hopefully I&#39;ll luck out.</p>
<p>Speaking of circles, my interests seem to be changing again. The last time this happened was in 1997 when I was introduced to computers. Now I seem to be getting back to my roots in art... with computers of course ;-). The whole comic thing sparked my intrest again and I&#39;m left wondering why I quit in the first place. I take that back, I quit because a) I couldn&#39;t get my frackin&#39; pencil drawings to look like the book, b) I thought there was no money in it. I&#39;ve figured both things out: pencil drawings suck, and I can make a killing as a graphics artist. I spent most of this afternoon redesigning my character in my comic and this is what I came up with:</p>

<p>As you can see the hair is more normal now, the glasses shrank and I&#39;ve switched to a harder shading style (the airbrush thing was just a pain in the butt). All this arty stuff has made me realize one thing: painting with a mouse is murder. That said, this coming pay check I&#39;m going to invest in a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16883100021">graphics tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve rambled on long enough. I probably need to be getting to bed here soon as there&#39;s another early day tomorrow :-P.</p>
