I suppose I can just ramble.</p>
<p>My Wal-Mart experiences of late have not been of the highest caliber. Granted, one doesn&#39;t usually expect world class service at the World of Walls, but this has been exceedingly blah. Cashiers who just don&#39;t give a shit, seem to be high out of their mind or cannot comprehend the English language are what greet me at my new Wal-Mart. Though, I just left my old one, full of good people whom I mostly know, after having gotten the worst cashier yet.</p>
<p>I was there to pick up the new Weird Al album (which was not in the new releases as it should have been) and made a bee line to express lane with the shortest queue. The cashier, some teenager named Jace, was trying to open his drawer, an action that locks up the register until a CSM has approved it from their keypad. Problem number one - you don&#39;t lock up your register when there are customers waiting and you don&#39;t have to. He then proceeded to get exceedingly pissed off, swearing and smashing the clear button on his keyboard. He was honestly becoming quite violent.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand his frustration with slow CSM response and the slowness to back out of an action on the aging registers. I&#39;ve been on both sides of of that equation. However, he did unessecarily bring it upon himself and his display of frustration was absolutely not professional.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I guess this post became a rant about my Wal-Mart experience, but it still counts.</p>
