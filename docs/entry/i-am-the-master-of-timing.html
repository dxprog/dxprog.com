I didn&#39;t think I could do it, but it turned out to be not so difficult. Yay me! Now that that&#39;s out of the way, let me weave you a tale.</p>
<p>Four days a week, I eat Hot Pockets(R) for lunch (the fifth is usually Subway). I have a very specific routine:</p>
<p>1) Walk to break room
2) Grab Hot Pocket(R) and set microwave for 2 minutes
3) Leave break room and take a leak
4) Return to break room and retrieve Hot Pocket(R)</p>
<p>Mundane, yes? Nothing special happening here, right? That&#39;s where you&#39;d be wrong. By the time I return to the break room from the the bathroom, the microwave will read, WITHOUT FAIL, between 18 and 22 seconds left.</p>
<p>This routine, with all the variables (how fast I walk, how much I need to piss, people I might bump into along the way, etc), takes 1 minute and 40 seconds with an error rate of -2/+2 seconds. That&#39;s pretty damn good if you ask me.</p>
