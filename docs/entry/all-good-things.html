It&#39;s not entirely intentional, there&#39;s just really nothing to talk about. Sometimes, while I&#39;m attempting to force myself into a state of unconsciousness, I&#39;ll think of these things I&#39;d love to post ranting about this, that, or the other. However, rarely do I actually act upon these impulses and the dust continues to gather.</p>
<p>The one thing that has happened since I last blogged is the passage of time. And with that passage I draw ever nearer to my graduation date. Currently, I sit at less than a month till I walk with my fellow classmates and receive the piece of paper for which I have worked so hard to achieve. It&#39;s hard to believe that not two years ago I was making preparations to come here the thought of actual completion not even in my head. But, here we are.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve achieved much in my short twenty-one months at Full Sail, both from an academic and personal standpoint. I&#39;ve improved my design skills, learned the technical art of motion graphics, and added to my repertoire of marketable programming skills through ActionScript. I know better how things in the industry work and have finally been able to get the professional critique that I so longed for as a hobbyist working out of his parents&#39; house.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made a lot of memories at this school, both good and bad. It&#39;ll be sad to have leave all the friends I&#39;ve made, but everyone tells me I have a bright future ahead of me. As for what I think of that, I&#39;m not entirely sure. I know I have marketable skills, but there are some things that I know will hold me back. For example, I would like to live close to my family. That alone throws out almost any motion graphics or film job that I could have. I suppose it boils down to what&#39;s more important to me: my family and friends or my career. Even at that, I don&#39;t really know what career path I&#39;d like to do. i enjoy and am proficient at many things (both inside and outside my degree).</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;ll stop there before I completely depress myself. The next few months are going to have a crucial part in shaping my future. I&#39;d better make damn sure I get it right.</p>
