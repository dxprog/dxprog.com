Everytime they say &quot;biscuit&quot; instead of cookie I think to myself &quot;Stupid, buscuiting Brits!&quot;. But I digress.</p>
<p>Actually, one thing I hate more than Brits is fruit flies. And, apparently, they hate me too. They&#39;ve been trying to kill me lately. Over the last two weeks they&#39;ve sent suicide bombers down my windpipe and up my esophagus. It&#39;s really pissing me off. I&#39;ll be happily watching Next Gen or something, there&#39;ll be a faint &quot;bzzztt&quot; followed by the nast coughing fits. Burn in Hell, fruit flies, burn in hell.</p>
<p>Finished with my Pokemon game I decided to have some fun. That&#39;s right, I hacked my save file. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of selling the game off and picking up Puzzle League. As much as I still think it&#39;s a bastardization of Tetris Attack (which I&#39;ve been playing like crazy as of late) the thought of ranked online matches is a sweet morsel I may not be able to pass up. Maybe I&#39;ll just stick with Tetris DS for now. Maybe I should stop buying games.</p>
<p>At least until Eternal Sonata comes out ;-)</p>
