Last night I got everything drawn, scanned, colored, etc. and when it came to writing down the dialog I realized the joke was not funny. So, I will give you guys the artwork I drew instead because I still like that. Well, I like how I drew Wedge, anyways.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t take out the text bubbles so you, my readers, can use your wild imaginations and pretend there <em>is</em> writing in them and that it <em>is</em> funny.</p>
