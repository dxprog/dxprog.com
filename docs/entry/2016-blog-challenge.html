<p>Let&#39;s not beat around the bush, here: this blog has been a fucking ghost town for quite some time now. Last year was quiet, but the only thing I&#39;ve written at <em>all</em> this year is an out-of-nowhere post about a frog watering contraption. Kind of sad, really. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t have anything to write about, necessarily, but can&#39;t quite figure out the &quot;correct&quot; way to write it. One thing leads to another, and that generally lead to nothing in the end.</p>
<p>That brings us to here. At the suggestion of my <a href="http://mom28kids.com/2016/11/blog-throwdown-2016/">dearest mother</a>, we&#39;ll be doing one of those post-a-day challenges for the month of November. She&#39;s started off by writing about how she&#39;s slowly becoming an evening alcoholic (I kid, I kid), but I&#39;m not sure where to begin.</p>
<p>2016 has been a rather strange year, for sure. It might actually be one of my busiest on record, but it doesn&#39;t really feel like I&#39;ve accomplished anything. Here&#39;s a bulleted list of things that may or may not become posts later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spent a couple weekends in snowy Tahoe with friends</li>
<li>Threw not one, but <em>two</em> little parties at my apartment</li>
<li>Quit LinkedIn</li>
<li>Visited Japan</li>
<li>Started working at Twitch</li>
<li>Quit working at Twitch</li>
<li>Meandered around in unemployment for a while</li>
<li>Started working at LinkedIn again</li>
<li>Made a road trip to Seattle, visiting friends and family along the way</li>
<li>Housed a friend and colleague from work for a week</li>
<li>Various other ancillary things</li>
</ul>
<p>The work nonsense is certainly the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; of this blog escapade, so I&#39;ll probably start on that tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this is a post with words that hasn&#39;t really said anything in particular. Good thing this is a quantity and not quality challenge!</p>
