<p>As it turns out, FedEx delivers Tuesday through Saturday, so my lost weekend is less so.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been wanting a decent camera for some time as the point and shoots do not deliver the kind of quality I would prefer (and tend to fall apart rather quickly). I was actually planning on picking up a dSLR last year before the <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/from-the-con-floor-day-1/">anime convention</a>, but, I couldn&#39;t find one for a decent enough price that also did video. The answer to that problem, apparently, is to simply wait a year.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now - still wanting a good camera for the con - and the camera I&#39;ve purchased, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J3V90Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p421_d6_g421_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=19H1SBQ8D7AXT6FGWZCS&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938811&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Canon Rebel T3i</a> retails for $750, well under the lower end numbers from last year. Toss in some clever shopping about and selling off of soon-to-be deprecated hardware (my old camcorder), and that $750 is brought down to a much more tolerable $350.</p>
<p>Even at $750, it would have been worth every goddamn penny. The picture above was taken with the flash <em>off</em> in my poorly lit bathroom. AND IT STILL LOOKS AMAZING (my troll face notwithstanding)!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not yet played around with the video option much, but expect some new movies this month now with fancy, movie style <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzC0Ek6X5FY">rack focus</a>!</p>
