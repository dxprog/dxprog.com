Once that&#39;s done, toss them in a pan or on the grill to brown them (with onions is a nice touch). It&#39;s that easy and they&#39;re fuckin&#39; delicious!</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> - I was sick two days this week and felt like not great most of the others. My eating habits were way off, though I was certainly eating less. I did have drive-thru once (at Braum&#39;s) on one of my sicker days because I was super starving and it sounded amazing. Needless to say, not much exercise was had either.</p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> - The only superfluous spending I did this week was to pitch in for the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/explosm/the-cyanide-and-happiness-show">Cyanide &amp; Happiness Kickstarter</a>. I&#39;m considering this the other part of my $50 monthly entertainment budget.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese</strong> - Sickness definitely ate into this, making it not happen. I will take last week&#39;s proclamation of 30+ per weekday and apply it this week (wherein I am within means to do so... more on that later).</p>
