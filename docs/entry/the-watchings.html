<p><em>## Normal Shows</em></p>
<p><strong>Breaking Bad</strong> - Currently somewhere in season 2. Everybody lost their shit over this show and, while I certainly think it&#39;s well written, it hasn&#39;t quite gotten to the &quot;gripping&quot; part for me yet. Also, the episodes are so long and deep that it&#39;s a hard one to marathon.</p>
<p><strong>Parks and Rec</strong> - Basic sitcom, and a humorous one at that. Unlike Breaking Bad, I could watch this all day. Light and fluffy.</p>
<p><strong>Star Trek (TOS)</strong> - I&#39;m somewhere down at the end of the first season and it&#39;s been entertaining so far. Despite the rocky start it&#39;s had trying to flesh out that universe, the core stories feel very Trek.</p>
<p><em>## Anime</em></p>
<p>The new season just started, and I don&#39;t want to give away too much of my opinions for the end-of-year reviews, so I&#39;ll keep this brief.</p>
<p><strong>Kyoukai no Kanata</strong> - The new KyoAni show, so obviously I have to watch. They&#39;ve been on kind of a fantasy/mystery kick lately and this falls right in line with that.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Time</strong> - Some college harem show. The first episode was pretty abysmal, but I&#39;ll stick around for the second to see if it improves and where they go with the cliffhanger ending.</p>
<p><strong>Little Busters Refrain</strong> - I enjoyed the first season enough to watch the second. It&#39;s Key, so generally that means emotionally manipulative stuff even if it&#39;s not being expertly executed by KyoAni.</p>
<p><strong>Nagi no Asukara</strong> - Interesting show about fish humans. I have a super weak spot for oceany type things, and the visuals hit that spot with a jack hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Kill la Kill</strong> - From the guys who brought you Gurren Lagann, another crazy ass, stylized action show.</p>
<p>So, yeah. There&#39;s my post for the day.</p>
