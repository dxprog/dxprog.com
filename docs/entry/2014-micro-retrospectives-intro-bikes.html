I don&#39;t even know why we give this any mind; time is but a human construct and the &quot;new year&quot; marker could have been placed at any point. Indeed, other cultures have their own ways of keeping time with their own &quot;new years&quot;. Interesting that the concept of a &quot;year&quot;, a larger span of time filled with many smaller demarcations of time, is seen in most of these calendar systems. Still, I&#39;m happy to use an arbitrary position on our planet&#39;s orbit to define the changing of the year. Whatever, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here to talk about.</p>
<p>For myself, 2014 was arguably less exciting than 2013. No sudden life changes, no international trips, just a fairly standard year. Still, it wasn&#39;t without its own interesting things and I&#39;ll now take a look back at the more notable things that happened in a series of very short blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
<p>I&#39;d purchased a bike in 2013, shortly after returning from Japan (partially because my original bike had been stolen while I was gone). Despite having it, I didn&#39;t make use of it nearly as much as I should have. But, this year, I began going on long rides with friends which really makes the whole experience much more appealing. On top of that, I bought a <a href="http://www.cannondale.com/nam_en/2015/bikes/road/elite-road/caad8/caad8-6-tiagra">very nice bike</a> and, as I became more accustomed to it, started upgrading that with nice upgrades like better wheels and clips. All said and done, I logged over 1800 miles this year which is an accomplishment I&#39;m quite proud of.</p>
<p>That&#39;s today, tomorrow might be more!</p>
