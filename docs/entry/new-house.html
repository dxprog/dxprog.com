Today, day one of house-on-the-market-dom, an investor came by to look at the place. As I write this we have no idea what his thoughts are, but the fact that it&#39;s only been a day is promising.</p>
<p>In programming land I downloaded every pattern from ACC and am having fun fiddling with that data. First I converted it all into pattern data (a string 1024 bytes long using hex numbers for image data) and yesterday a wrote a little compression algorithm. It&#39;s similar to BMPs RLE compression and just about halved the size of the file. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll do with the stuff now. I may lump it all into a database and build a viewer around it (it would be nice if the guy who ran ACC liked it and hired me to write the ASP version).</p>
<p>Well, we&#39;re going to be eating lunch so that&#39;s all I&#39;ll write for today. Heck, maybe the next entry will be written from our new house (would be nice). Cheers :-)</p>
