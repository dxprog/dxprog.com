<p>So our tale of love and romance comes to a crashing conclusion... literally. Actually, this was the idea that inspired the whole idea in the first place.</p>
<p>It should be duly noted that Master Chief&#39;s real name is in fact John (or John-117). In the original comic it was just Chief, but at the prompting of a friend of mine it was changed to John. I figured he ought to know as he&#39;s finished both games and read the books (whereas I&#39;m not even halfway through the first game. I just play multiplayer all the time).</p>
<p>I was thinking about having a Cortana episode where she&#39;s jealous and such, but drawing Master Chief is kind of a bitch (as you probably have figured out) so I&#39;m wrapping it up here.</p>
