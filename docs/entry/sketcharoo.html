Well it&#39;s back, only not quite so themed. The reason I stopped in the first place is because thqat Midna picture really bummed me out. It sucked. Hard core.</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve actually got two days worth of drawing goodness, so I&#39;ll give you the first one:</p>

My Guitar Hero guitar. Take special note of the Limozeen and Teen Girl Squad stickers. Okay, they&#39;re kind of hard to see.</p>
<p>Yuna, a la Final Fantasy X</p>
<p>Some teacup from my sisters&#39; tea set.</p>

Mario as seen in Mario Sunshine (an awesome game). I&#39;m really pleased with how that came out. Also, there&#39;s Toad. I wasn&#39;t really trying to get a good shape or anything, I just wanted something to test my new pens out on. Up at the top is a little tuft of hair. Just wanted to practice some hair shading.</p>
