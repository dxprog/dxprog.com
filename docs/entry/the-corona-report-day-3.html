The entire state is now in the same kind of lock down that we in the Bay Area have been experiencing, but that really means very little for us.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve often avoided working from home with the excuse that I&#39;m in a better headspace in the office. This is partially true and partially a ruse to &quot;work from home&quot;... and have extended drinking lunches with friends. Except, the headspace thing may not even be true. In having had to work from home the last few days and taking the time to have a proper computer setup with lots of monitors, and overly expensive clacky keyboard, and all the ammenities, I&#39;ve come to a realization. I can&#39;t work from a <em>laptop</em>. It&#39;s one screen. One tiny screen. Who even does that... for reals?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#39;m planning an adventure back into the real world to grab machine screws so I can wall mount my TV in the living room. I&#39;m a little excited, because that&#39;ll free up space on top of the TV stand to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put my turntable, which has been largely inaccessible for the last few years. I look forward to cooking the sweet sounds of scratchy vinyl.</li>
<li>My Switch can <em>also</em> go on top of the TV stand which means easier access for docking/undocking.</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of the Switch, the years and years of being without a new Animal Crossing game is finally coming to an end. As I understand, it&#39;s currently live for the states but I&#39;m here typing this post instead of playing because my girlfriend pressured me to (hi, Kayla. I love you. I see you reading this as I type it). I also love Animal Crossing and I think during this time of weirdness, it&#39;ll provide a nice comfort. Also, who doesn&#39;t want to do crappy labor for Tom Nook to pay off exorbitant real estate debt in <em>glorious HD</em>?</p>
<p>With that, I think I&#39;ll gonna finagle my Switch out of it&#39;s tight space and zone out on that for a bit.</p>
