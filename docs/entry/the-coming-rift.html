That is, <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/">dxprog.com</a> will be home to my personal blog whereas <a href="http://www.matthackmann.net">matthackmann.net</a> will be the home to my professional blog, resume, and other stuff like that. It more imporatant now than ever that I create a professional image for myself what with my career looming in the future and, sooner than that, the likelihood that I&#39;ll be taking on some freelance projects while still in school. So, there you have it. You now have some time to decide which poison you want whilst I make the finishing touches on my other half.</p>
