On the upside, I get to have a longer birthday than usual. On the downside, I&#39;m leaving Japan. I looking forward to being back in the States, though. It&#39;ll be nice to be able to go into places and understand the language and also to have Taco Bell and pizza. I&#39;ll leave you with a stupid ass video taken in our hotel room on some evening I don&#39;t remember. Sayounara!</p>
