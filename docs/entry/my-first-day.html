Overall I think it went pretty well (except all the women&#39;s underwear I had to handle :-P). However, it&#39;ll be nice when I can go in there and know what to do instead of hanging around more seasoned coworkers and have them coach me through everything. </p>
<p>I just did the math and my first paycheck should be about $326.20. Figuring I get about that much every week (and those are only 25 hour work weeks, mind you) by the time Christmas is over I&#39;ll have around $1300! Enough to by myself that laptop :-D</p>
<p>In non-job related news, my Episode III DVD arrived today. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said it already, but I got it completely free all because I took a survey :-D. It doesn&#39;t get much sweeter than that. I&#39;ll probably watch it tonight and watch all the extras over the next few days. Ought to be a nice break from work :-).</p>
