So for those of you out there who pray please add in an extra word to the man upstairs that all this goes through :-).</p>
<p>Bowling league starts again in a couple weeks (13th) which I am looking forward to. Dad and I had been on a Monday league over the summer, but it was with &quot;commoners&quot; (i.e. people who come and bowl every now and again) and the atmosphere was.... common :-P. Now we&#39;ll be in a USBCC sanctioned league again with all our bowling buddies from last year :-D.</p>
<p>I will be updating in as much as I can. Stay tuned. Now back to our regularly scheduled program...</p>
