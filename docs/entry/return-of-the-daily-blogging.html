Seeing how this blog is currently collecting figurative dust, I feel like I should try this again. Some days shall be easier than others as the <a href="http://tokyointulsa.com/">anime convention</a> happens this month. Additionally, I shall be taking a trip to Dallas with my dad and brothers to partake in the excitingness that is Six Flags over Texas. I quite enjoy the thrill of rollar coasters, I do.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m a bit drunk at the moment and the room is quite spinning, so this blog shall have to remain as it is, but expect there to be <em>something</em> on the face of this blog every day for the month of July. I will leave off with the first thing that came up for a google image search of &quot;drunk&quot;.</p>
