July 28, 1999
It&#39;ll probably take a few pages to catch up on the latest events. Our two weeks were successfully completed. We&#39;re going to see the &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; on Sunday. Yesterday we went swimming. I did a bunch of diving. I also did a 360. I tryed to do a front flip but belly floped. Mom found out I had been on AOL. My computer privaliges have been revoked for a long time. I finally got my thing from Jen. A K-Mart Card. A whopping ten bucks. Whee. My shoe landed at Wisconson. A new record. My foot is just about healled.I got a letter from Val last week. I got a couple neat &quot;Episode I&quot; books. One&#39;s a vehicle cross-section book. The other is &quot;The making of STAR WARS: The Phantom Menace&quot; book. The Mos Espa stands (the people in them anyway) are colored Q-tips. Oh Yeah! I forgot. I got a watch strap with the K-Card. Tomorrow I&#39;m gonna get me some goggles. My day&#39;s of batboy are over. I also got to play. The other team forfieted on our second game. And I finally got to play. Dad&#39;s letting me have his old ball shirt. I fixed it up with the stinky marker. Yuck! My fish is probably close to a couple months old. I used my book certificate to get Jedi Apprentice #2. I hope the library gets #3 soon. That&#39;s right your eyes aren&#39;t play tricks on you. Jedi Apprentice #3 Hidden Past. Great isn&#39;t it. But now as I close this entry is the most exciting news. I HAVE A PEN-PAL!!!! His name is John [name redacted]. I got his letter two days after I got my GO FORTH. Jeff Chis and Stevie were on the list too. And Joey was in the new baby spot. Well! Better get to be. Soon it&#39;s....

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong> - For whining about the &quot;meager&quot; K-mart card, I certainly had that money spent &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>Of all the things mentioned here, I latch onto the mention of my fish the most.  This was the last fish I had and also the longest living one, dying somewhere at the incredible age of five years old (at least, five years under my care). At the time this was written, I suspect I had not yet named him. Eventually he came to be known as Fishface, but it was not a conscious &quot;I&#39;m going to here on refer to you as Fishface&quot; kind of thing. I just continually referred to him as that and it stuck. God, I miss that fish....</p>
<p>Also, I myself could not remember what the successful &quot;two weeks&quot; thing was all about. Some bribe from my parents, no doubt. Jeff seems to think that it was going to bed on time for two weeks, which would certainly be fitting for ourselves at the time.</p>
<p><em>## Glossary of Terms</em>
<strong>Go Forth</strong> was a small time Catholic periodical for kids. I don&#39;t remember much about the content outside of the fact that the back page was full of &quot;user generated content,&quot; for lack of a better term, and also a list of kids&#39; names/ages/addresses for the pen pal list. I had no less than three pen pals from that, none of which I have been in contact with for many, many years.</p>
