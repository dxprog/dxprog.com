<p>I&#39;ll be glad when tomorrow rolls around and I can just do a picture dump of cosplayers from the convention...</p>
<p>But, today, I don&#39;t have that luxury, so I&#39;ll just ramble a bit.</p>
<p>International travel is something that hasn&#39;t ever intrigued me much, save for two destinations. The first is a rather obvious trip to Japan. It&#39;s impossible to say that the Oriental archipelago hasn&#39;t affected my life and attitude in some way, so a trip there to see the source of it all is certainly in order. My two oldest brothers and myself are planning on fulfilling this order sometime next year.</p>
<p>The second place that I&#39;d love to visit you probably wouldn&#39;t guess... unless you&#39;re one of the people whom I&#39;ve told and subsequently think that I&#39;m crazy for even thinking this. That place would be Prypiat, Ukraine - the city inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.</p>
<p>I cannot explain why I find the whole story around the Chernobyl disaster so intriguing. Part of it is because I find nuclear power in itself utterly fascinating. I recall when the Great East Japan Earthquake broke out last year and Fukushima Daiichi began its series of cascading failures, I religiously checked the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">IAEA</a> website for new information several times a day hungry for more information on what was happening. I did that for a solid two months, hanging on to every word mentioned about the core temperatures, water levels, radiation spread, and so forth. Maybe I just have an interest in nuclear disaster...</p>
<p>But, I digress.</p>
<p>Yes, the Chernobyl disaster is something that I&#39;ve been interested in for a very long time. I remember reading again and again a National Geographic article on it when I was around 11 or 12. They had aerial pictures of the core shortly after the explosion, pictures of reactor 4 before the sarcophagus went up, cut away diagrams of the melted reactor material oozing into the basement. It&#39;s amazingly fascinating stuff. So, when a fellow redditor posted <a href="http://imgur.com/a/trm7p">images of his tour</a>, all those feelings of intrigue were dredged up again. Plus, Prypiat is now <a href="http://tour2chernobyl.com/">open for tours</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, this is a tour of the ghost town outside of the plant rather than a tour of the plant itself (which I would prefer and then get cancer for having done), but that in and of itself would be pretty awesome, if not entirely creepy. Perhaps I can realize this dream in 2014 or beyond.</p>
<p>Unless I have a girlfriend or something...</p>
