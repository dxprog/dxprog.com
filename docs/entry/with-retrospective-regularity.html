Here&#39;s most of that letter, with some rather... personal thoughts redacted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear FutureMe,</p>
<p>Well, hey there. That was one hell of a message you wrote two years ago. This one might be a little different. More uplifting? Sure. Let&#39;s go.</p>
<p>Work seems to be the thing I talk about first, so let&#39;s start there. In 2018 you finally left LinkedIn forever (probably) and SurveyMonkey, while seemingly a step down in engineering prestige, has a lot of great potential for personal growth. I expect by the time you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ll have joined the Wrench or possible web platform teams. But, no reason to think you&#39;ll have left. Hopefully that stock will have gone somewhere...</p>
<p>Love life! Dating PERSON A right now, and have been in continuous contact with her for a bit over a month now. This is the first time I think I can see an actual relationship forming in the future, though I have a couple hangups (redact from the blog if you want):</p>
<p>1) The adopted teenager thing raises an eyebrow. I respect the shit out of her for doing that, but not sure how I am with it. Somewhat conversely, if she&#39;s against having her own kids, that&#39;d be a relationship ending event.</p>
<p>2) [REDACTED]</p>
<p>If I had to make a prediction for one year from now... well, there&#39;s no reason to believe that anything will be called off at this point. Unless the speed at which this relationship is going becomes an issue. /shrug</p>
<p>In terms of personal achievements for 2019, I&#39;d really love to get my pilots license. We&#39;ll see how that goes. Definitely want to put more time into the YouTube channel and I want to have the NES boombox finished and hopefully garnering some views from HaD and maybe even Kotaku and other outlets. That&#39;ll be the thing I need to get some viewership, I think. Hopefully the thought of not disappointing a bunch of subscribers will drive me to do more.</p>
<p>Okay, that&#39;s that. Nothing more to talk about... I am curious about where one other thing will be in a year&#39;s time. My money is on &quot;nooooope&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was a chatty one that year. Per usual, I spent most of it talking about my love life, because compared to all the other normal Hakk shit I do, that&#39;s always been the nut I couldn&#39;t crack and the only thing people seem to want to know about when meeting up after a time (looking at you, Hackmann Family Reunion 2019). Okay, let&#39;s knock out the bullet points.</p>
<p><strong>WORK</strong></p>
<p>More or less accurate. Still at SurveyMonkey, still really enjoying it. I&#39;ve not actually bounced to the UI patterns infrastructure team (aka Wrench), or any inftrastructure team. Still on growth and feel like this might be the most comfortable yet fulfilling job I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s firmly within my wheelhouse of knowledge in terms of technicals, I get to flex a little on design and product, yet there&#39;s still opportunity to grow. I like it. I like it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>LOVE LIFE</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure where to start here, really. I think when I&#39;d written this, I&#39;d seen PERSON A... <em>twice?</em> Which is an awful not many dates to be saying &quot;oh, hey. we&#39;ll totes be together a year from now&quot;. My guess is that I was high on the idea that I&#39;d hit that elusive second date and was still talking to said date. But, yeah, those hangups... The one not redacted I stand by, though I don&#39;t like the way I worded it. The one redacted... honestly, embarrassed that I wrote it at all. I suppose the short story shorter is, PERSON A broke things off with me about a month after this letter. Then PERSON B came and went. PERSON C, however...</p>
<p>Towards the end of summer when I realized things with PERSON B weren&#39;t actually going to pan out but it wasn&#39;t officially dead yet, I was about ready to swear off the dating apps again for a while. I&#39;d still sift through my twice daily email of OkCupid &quot;matches&quot;, maybe handing a like out here, reading a profile there, and on rare occasion, making contact (nobody ever messaged me first, unless it was a bot). It was all crickets, mostly, and I was tired of being disheartened by it. I don&#39;t recall if it was one of these email suggestions or random perusal, but I read the profile of somebody who seemed interesting and theoretically had personality overlap with me. I fired off some stupid quippy message about a picture on her profile and moved on; this was usually where communications stopped. Surprisingly, she took the bait and responded, the beginning of a little back and forth. Given that I was starting a two week vacation to the midwest, I expected the lead to fizzle out before I could get back for an actual date. But, we texted the entire time, eventually met up, went to Disneyland on a random whim, and - fast forward some months later - now live together in a new house (and have been to Disneyland three more times). There&#39;s a hell of a lot of things glossed over in that sentence, but suffice to say... I feel like the search is over. It&#39;s a little mind boggling how aligned we are on so many things and how fast we clicked; it&#39;s the kind of stuff one might scoff at in some romcom. Despite the speed by which they went by, the last few months have felt like years and I&#39;m excited for our future together.</p>
<p><strong>PILOT&#39;S LICENSE</strong></p>
<p>Nope! I was hot on that for a couple months, started reading the Pilot&#39;s Handbook, and it fizzled out. Not sure I really care anymore at this point, at least not for a PPL and small prop craft. What I <em>really</em> want to do is get IFR certified and takeoff/land small jets that otherwise fly themselves. It&#39;s a weird desire.</p>
<p><strong>YOUTUBE/HAKK&#39;S LAB</strong></p>
<p>Surprised I hadn&#39;t pivoted at the point of writing this letter, but I did make and release another Hakk&#39;s lab video last April. However, it was about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxqd1D5ddno">burning an NES SimCity repro cartridge</a> and not the NES (or SNES, as I probably meant it) boombox. But, I did get my wish and got <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/04/19/manufacturing-simcity-for-the-nes/">featured on Hackaday</a> and a nice 100% bump in subscribes (up to a whole 250 as of this writing). That boombox thing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuJ2t38Pf-k">has made significant progress</a> and will definitely be the next video I publish... once I finish unpacking this house and get to a point where I can make things again. Pretty excited for that.</p>
<p><strong>THAT <em>OTHER</em> THING</strong></p>
<p>Second time running I&#39;ve left a cryptic note like this. I&#39;m not <em>100%</em> sure of what it&#39;s about, but if it is what I think it is, I was and continue to be wrong on that front. It trods on.</p>
<p>So, that&#39;s my reflection of both 2018&#39;s thoughts and 2019&#39;s actual happenings in a very short nutshell. It started off pretty mundane (with the exception of starting a whole bunch of exercise and losing a quarter of my person in weight, which was not talked about) and ended more spectacularly than I could have imagined. If 2019 was one for the books, 2020 is going to be one for the Library of Congress&#39; Film Archives!</p>
