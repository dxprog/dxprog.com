<p>I mean, hey! Why not? They already have a <a href="http://www.mcphee.com/items/10746.html">Jesus action figure, </a> and there have been religous games. The funny thing about one of those &quot;games&quot; in particular...</p>
<p>I believe it was a Noah game. A nice healthy game for young&#39;ns, only.... you needed a Doom cart to run it.</p>
