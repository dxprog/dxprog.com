Hi. Long time since I last wrote an entry. I&#39;ve come aways in QB. I have a program that will load .gif files in QB. I also have a program that will make gifs. gotta go bye![/quote]</p>
<p>I distinctly remember when I discovered the ability to load external graphics into my QBasic programs; it was something quite magical. Why I didn&#39;t go with Windows bitmaps as my format of choice, I don&#39;t know (super simple files to read), but what&#39;s interesting is that &quot;program that will makes gifs&quot; was none other than the original PSP - Paint Shop Pro. This was my first real interaction with a real graphics program and yet another piece of the puzzle that got me where I am today.</p>

Good news. I OWN VBASIC!!! I also own ROGUE SQUADRON! And IT&#39;S a girl!!!!! I also have a web page. Dan is going to mail me Turbo C++ with compiler. We have made a music album. We also have web again. [statement redacted] Leah e-mails me quite often. Well I have to go. Bye![/quote]</p>
<p>For my fourteenth birthday, my parents got me a (gimped) version of Visual Basic 6 that I had been eyeing at our local staples for months. I know for a fact that there&#39;s a picture of me cradling it with a dreamy look in my eyes hanging around somewhere (hint hint, mom). I also got a bitchin&#39; shark pillow that year (which I appropriately named &quot;Sharkey&quot;). Sadly, Sharkey is no longer with us and spends his days chilling underneath a mountain of trash somewhere west of Bartlesville.</p>
<p>Another interesting bit: the &quot;web&quot; of which I refer to was Juno, a free provider that had the most annoying ad window thingy. But, hey. Free internet without all the restrictions that the AOL software brought to it (no internet for other programs).</p>
<p>It was a simpler time.</p>
