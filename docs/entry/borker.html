I&#39;ll have that fixed in a day or two.</p>
<p>In the mean time I am recovering from a... ahem... computer problem. I shall just say this: don&#39;t go around deleting things unless you are absolutely, one hundred precent sure they don&#39;t have some sort of low-level hook into your system. And on top of that don&#39;t go stopping services unless you are completely certain you aren&#39;t going to need it. So, yeah.</p>
<p>That all said I won&#39;t be having a comic up today. I&#39;ll probably put something up on Tuesday.</p>
