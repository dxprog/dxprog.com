Now it&#39;s not because we didn&#39;t record it, we did. However, for those who&#39;ve listened to Ep II my voice started echoing the further it went on. This was due to the fact that both linkman and myself were recording seperate tracks and his mic picks up everything (including Katie yammering in the background). So we&#39;re waiting for linkman&#39;s headset to come in. Hopefully we&#39;ll make this Thursday or Friday.</p>
