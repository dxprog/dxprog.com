<h2 id="february-5th-2015">February 5th, 2015</h2>
<ol>
<li>Went to work today</li>
<li>Larger breakfast because everything looked good.</li>
<li>Made coffee. Then drank it</li>
<li>Refactored touch code to be more modular. Such tedium, decent results.</li>
<li>What the fuck, Nick? I get that it&#39;s nutella day, but I&#39;m trying to lose weight.</li>
<li>Doubled my morning water intake because I was thirsty</li>
<li>Salad with tuna for lunch. Such sadness</li>
<li>Leave work early to await my piano delivery</li>
<li>Oh, it&#39;s already here. And the stand is here too</li>
<li>&quot;Hey, guy. My name is Mr. Headache. Let me throb for a while&quot;.</li>
<li>Fuck you, Mr. Headache.</li>
<li>Still waiting for the piano pedals, but it&#39;s good to be playing things again.</li>
</ol>
<p>That almost felt therapeutic.</p>
