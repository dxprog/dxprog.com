Whatever :-P</p>
<p>Today, at roughly 4pm CDT, I return to my old job of cashiering. Am I excited? Am I looking forward to it? I&#39;ll just tell you one thing: I&#39;ve saved out my hawaiian SpongeBob shirt just for the occasian (i.e. hell, yes). I just hope I remember how to work the stupid register :-P</p>
<p>In other news, I got the graphics tablet I ordered up on Wednesday and I must say, it is a thing of beauty (and hance a joy forever). Today&#39;s comic was colored and highlighted using it and I have to say it&#39;s probably one of the best things I&#39;ve done so far. About the comic itself it seems that the style _is_ finally coming together (i.e. I&#39;m satisfied with it at the moment). I&#39;ve already got Monday&#39;s comic finished and have ideas for a couple weeks to come. I&#39;m so sucked into this at the moment I barely had time to finish coding the <a href="http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/">comic viewer</a>. From now on all my updates will be done over there so if you want to keep up on the comics add that to your favorites (I&#39;ll add in an RSS feed sometime within a week).</p>
<p>Also, for those who may not have gotten the hint, I am now legally licensed to drive in the state of Oklahoma. The test was brief, but nerve racking and I was only coached on a couple of minor points. So to date I&#39;ve driven twice on my own: once to take my homies to the library, and last night to take my homies to go bowling (my &quot;homies&quot; being Jeff and Chris). And despite the fact that money keeps slipping through my fingers I&#39;ve got enough of it stored up to make a nice down payment on a car, so that&#39;ll be coming down the road fairly soon (if you&#39;ll pardon the pun).</p>
<p>Well, I&#39;ve been up for way too long now and I need to get some rest if I&#39;m going to be in decent shape for work this afternoon.</p>
