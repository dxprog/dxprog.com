The people who are buying our house have basically set everything in stone and so now our house and the house we&#39;re getting will all have &quot;Sold&quot; signs. So now the packing begins (our room&#39;ll be a nightmare :-P) and in probably about two weeks we&#39;ll be in our house :-D. btw, here&#39;s some info on our <a href="http://remax.realtor.com/Prop/1048630457?lnksrc=00045&amp;gate=remax">new house</a>.</p>
<p>A couple days ago I picked up my free version of <a href="http://www.linspire.com">Linspire</a> and I decided to try to move over to Linux full time for a month. I got it installed and it was certainly nice looking. I went through some trouble figuring out how to use apt packages but I started to get the hang of things. And then the trouble set in. PHP was giving me problems with MySQL, depending on what program I tried I couldn&#39;t get the sound working/synced on DVDs (or avis) and Lsongs, while nice, obviously was running on a low priority because it would cut out frequently. And things went down from there. So, I&#39;m back on a fresh install of Win2K3 and it&#39;s nice to be home.</p>
<p>Got an interesting piece of mail the other day about a college down in Florida called FullSail that specializes in film [pre/post]-production. It&#39;s quite interesting because next to game programming the realm of film is my other big area of fascination. So whether I&#39;m going to DigiPen or this place is kind of a toss up. I guess I&#39;ll worry about that when I get there. Right now I have to keep studying for ye olde GED and get a job (so I can buy my laptop ;-)).</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for today. Stay tuned.</p>
