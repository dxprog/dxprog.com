While I was doing this, I  recalled some of my first web related programming projects, most notably YPNgine. Considering it was my first major PHP outing, I pulled off quite a feat. Writing a message board is no small task. However, there was one part in particular that I was mulling over: the censor. </p>
<p>If you happen to be a former YPNer, you may recall seeing many references to &quot;bottomembly&quot;. Carrying over the censor find/replace list that had been used on phpBB before it, all instances of the character sequence &quot;ass&quot; were summarily replaced with &quot;bottom&quot;. Now I am being very choosy when I say &quot;character sequence&quot; and not &quot;word&quot; as the censor couldn&#39;t differentiate words.</p>
<p>This oversight was brought to my attention my young programmer self struggled to figure out a solution. Here&#39;s what I wound up doing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">// Copyright (c) 2003 Matt Hackmann

function censor_post ($body)
{

    $query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bannedwords&quot;;
    $result = db_Query ($query);

    $body = &quot; &quot;.$body;

    $body = str_ireplace (&quot;assembly&quot;, &quot;ytrewq&quot;, $body);
    $body = str_ireplace (&quot;assum&quot;, &quot;asd;ljf&quot;, $body);
    $body = str_ireplace (&quot;glass&quot;, &quot;glss&quot;, $body);
    $body = str_ireplace (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hllo&quot;, $body);

    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; db_num_Rows ($result); $i++) {
        $row = db_fetch_array ($result);
        $body = str_ireplace ($row[&quot;blocked_word&quot;], &quot;&quot;, $body);
    }

    if ($body == &quot; &quot;)
        $body = &quot;Censored&quot;;

    $body = str_replace (&quot;asd;ljf&quot;, &quot;assum&quot;, $body);
    $body = str_replace (&quot;ytrewq&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot;, $body);
    $body = str_replace (&quot;glss&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, $body);
    $body = str_ireplace (&quot;hllo&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, $body);

    return $body;

}

<p>As you can see, I started hard coding in a list of safe words, replacing those instances with a random (or not so random) string of characters, run the censor and then convert those strings back to the safe words. This was a list I kept expanding on as they were found during normal conversation on the forum. I giggle as I look at this list and think of what the censor was doing to those words: bottomume, glbottom and hecko.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just something that I, eight years later, have to look back on and chuckle about.</p>
