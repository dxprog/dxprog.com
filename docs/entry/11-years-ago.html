<p>While I was visiting folks in September, I found my old vests back (which is to say my brother had held on to them all this time). Having hauled them back to the Bay with me, I decided that I&#39;d dress up as old cashier Matt for Halloween and wore the vest to work. Here&#39;s that same picture updated for modern times:</p>

<p>Looking back, I realized I was quite proud to be working at that store. Moreso than anything, I was probably just happy to have a job, but looking back on it, there was something to be proud of. During my not-quite-two years there, I went from quiet coder to a sociable person who could hold his own in the world. I worked in almost every department in the store in an attempt to be one of the most versitible people there. It was also slightly self-serving in that it allowed me to do something slightly different a lot, but that shit looks amazing in the eyes of management. I topped out at cashier &quot;management&quot;, which is really just ensuring the front-end was well manned and that cashiers get their breaks/lunch on time, gaining me the coveted red coat. It didn&#39;t last, as I went to cart pusher for the last few months there, but in retrospect, I&#39;m pretty proud of what I accomplished in the little time I was there.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a luxurious job, but I&#39;ll treasure what that time meant to me... always.</p>
