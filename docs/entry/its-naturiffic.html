Currently my graph is telling me that I had a pretty crappy week last week, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re here to discuss.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bartlesvilleparks.com/Pages/pathfinder1.html">Pathfinder Parkway</a> has been my preferred walking path of choice for the weekends as it removes me from all the loud roads and reminds me of the lengthy walks I took to the bank in Winter Park via the <a href="http://www.dep.state.fl.us/gwt/guide/regions/eastcentral/trails/cadyway.htm">Cady Way Trail</a>. The Pathfinder runs right along the Caney River, Bartlesville&#39;s local body of poisoned water, but it does provide that &quot;nature&quot; feel. But, I could throw words at you all day and not get the point across, so queue up the photo gallery!</p>
<p>[gallery=Pathfinder Parkway]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_path.jpg" alt="" title="A shot of the path itself, all shrouded in foresty glory"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_bridge.jpg" alt="" title="The footbridge that crosses the Caney. Its iron/wood construction gives it a rustic quaint feel, I think, and adds to the experience of walking the trail"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_pump.jpg" alt="" title="An old abandoned oil pump. This is just one of many, but hey, it&#39;s Oklahoma so it&#39;s to be expected, right? I&#39;ll admit, though, it&#39;s kind of eerie walking right up alongside these things out in the middle of nowhere with their ominous whir and the wonderful stench of unearthed oil."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_tanks.jpg" alt="" title="Of course, where there are oil pumps, there will be storage tanks. But, damn, are they dilapidated."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_car.jpg" alt="" title="Wait...? What? A car? How the hell did they get that thing out in the middle of a forest? Obviously drunk, otherwise they&#39;d have not careened off the cliff."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_mixer.jpg" alt="" title="Okay? Seriously? An abandoned cement mixer? Aren&#39;t there scrap heaps or something where these things can be dumped?"><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_traction_engine.jpg" alt="" title="HOLY SHIT! It&#39;s Terrance from Thomas the Tank Engine! OMG OMG OM.... WTF?!!">[/gallery]</p>
<p>Okay, so it has it&#39;s downsides. Arguably the most annoying part is the dozen or so oil pumps, but it&#39;s amazing the crap I&#39;ve spotted along this trail. I will, perhaps, update again with more pictures later as these just barely scratch the surface.</p>
