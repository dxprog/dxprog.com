<p>Well, it&#39;s once again that time of year. Wait... I&#39;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>In celebration of the upcoming Easter season, I have gone and hidden an easter egg right here my little ol&#39; website. I task you, my wonderful viewers, to find this easter egg and, once you&#39;ve found it, post either a screen shot or description of the egg right here in the comments. The first person to find it just very well may get a prize of some sort (maybe an old game I don&#39;t want or a drawing or whatever).</p>
<p>SO! Put on your detective eyes and clicking things, scrutinizing pixels, inspecting source code, whatever. How will you know you&#39;ve found it? Oh, trust me. You&#39;ll know...</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
