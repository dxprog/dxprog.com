While getting there, I ran into this gem of a photo:</p>

<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>Why is she holding a dirty spoon? She&#39;s clearly not cooking as can be noted by the exceptionally clean counters.</p>
<p>What exactly is she doing? Singing into her dirty spoon?</p>
<p>Where is the oven? Were there any dishes around, I&#39;d expect to see maybe a chocolate cake or brownies... but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a place to cook them.</p>
<p>Her outfit seems very 90s. Denim jumper thing with leggings. Hell, the might even be stirrup pants and the stirrups are covered by socks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a curious thing.</p>
