I&#39;m hoping I can get a refund and if I can&#39;t get that I hope at least that these games won&#39;t fritz on me immediatly. But, my ALttP cart (which I learned is also pirated) hasn&#39;t gone nutzy on me yet, so maybe if I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ll still be playing these when I&#39;m 50 :-P.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve finished with my changes to the <a href="http://www.parishofstpeter.net">parish site</a>. I had a fun journey into RSS land and the nightmares of PHP&#39;s XML handling came back to haunt me as well :-P. I also decided to put up scanned copies of the bulletin due to the format changes it undergoes each week. It makes me look like a hypocrite because a couple weeks ago the guy who runs the Our Lady of Guadelupe site was on my case for not getting the bulletin up-to-date and was talking about how he just scanned theirs in. I stupidly answered &quot;Nah, that&#39;s cheating. I couldn&#39;t do that.&quot; Well, I did it. However, in my defense, I have a high quality, lossless scan whereas his, well, <a href="http://www.ourladyofguadalupe-dewey.org/bulletin.htm">you make the call</a>.</p>
<p>This afternoon mom and I are going to look at houses (my opinion is highly valued ;-)). With any luck we&#39;ll find something spacious enough for us at a decent price. Maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll post on how all that went, but until then...</p>
