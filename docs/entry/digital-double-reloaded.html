<p>Starting today I&#39;m off hiatus. There&#39;ll be a few changes however. Firstly, Jimmy&#39;s that guy in the middle. His hair is much easier to draw now. Secondly, that would be Mary on the right. These two things were the main reason I went on hiatus. Thirdly, there&#39;ll be a format change. I&#39;m going to do more story arcs instead of weak jokes and sad parodies. Finally, I&#39;ll be going with a every Wednesday update. Now that I&#39;m full time at Wal-Mart it&#39;s difficult to update twice a week. I figure I should also be able to keep this up once I&#39;m in college in the fall.</p>
