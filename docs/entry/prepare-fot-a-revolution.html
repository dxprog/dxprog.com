The new Nintendo Revolution controller was finally unveiled. At first I was kind of skeptical, I mean the thing is a freakin&#39; remote:

Part of me kind of died because I&#39;ve grown up holding a controller in two hands using super quick thumb reflexes to get myself around. However, the more I thought about the possibilities of the tilt sensors, the more I began to like it. One thing that I would love to see is a Star Wars lightsaber game. I was still kind of leery, but then I heard that there&#39;s a conventional controller that you can plug the remote into. Besides, I&#39;ll be able to play Tetris Attack, so I have to buy one whether I like the controller or note. Needless to say I really can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one of these and see how it works.</p>
<p>On the house front: A good 75-80% of the house is packed now. Mainly just the big things (furniture, appliances, computers, etc.) are left. Sometime tomorrow we&#39;ll be getting a dumpster and emptying the garage and packing the U-Haul. It&#39;s going to be a long, tiring week but it&#39;ll be well worth it.</p>
<p>As an interesting closer I post some things I&#39;ve unearthed (either through packing or cleaning up my computer):
