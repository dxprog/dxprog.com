But, whatever.</p>

<p>Some time ago, a coworker passed along a link to this very nifty <a href="http://thecolourclock.co.uk/">Colour Clock</a> which displays the time and uses the values of said time to drive the background color. It&#39;s really quite pretty and nifty. Back when he linked me, there was the flash version on the site and a download for an OS X screen saver. No Windows love.</p>
<p>So, I fired up my copy of Visual Studio and set about correcting this sadness. I never really polished it to the extent I wanted, which is why I&#39;m putting it up as a source code release. There is a binary in there, but no installer or anything.</p>
<p>Also, before I created this version, I also conjured up a JavaScript one as well, which you can see <a href="http://labs.dxprog.com/color_clock.html">here</a>.</p>
