We actually went there every night of the trip, including the night we flew in. It was a little over a mile walk to, but was interesting enough that we would cap every day off with it. It helped that there was a Taito Game Station in the area as well as a restaurant that we frequented a couple times.</p>
<p>The actual shrine itself is more newly built, being made of modern materials; that&#39;s probably because we fire bombed the shit out of Tokyo way back when. It&#39;s mildly disappointing, but still unusual in form by Western standards. Also, this place was chock full of tourists, both other Japanese natives and foreigners. This place was <em>always</em> packed. Of course, there&#39;s a shopping arcade setup along the strip to catch the likes of these people, though it was surprisingly short on non-sweets food stalls, a fact that I always lamented.</p>
<p>But, enough of my banter, you want pictures and pictures I shall provide.</p>
