not a creature was stirring except for the dudeon his laptop.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t rhyme, but I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m sitting here in our new living room lit up tree in front of me and a fireplace full of stockings to my right (picture coming soon). Now this in and of itself is a nice feeling but having my laptop and posting here while doing it makes the feeling cooler ;-). But anyhoo...</p>
<p>Christmas _is_ is coming and we&#39;ve been doing all the usual: making cookies, listening to Christmas music (even while I&#39;m at work :-D), buying gifts, etc. I&#39;d say that we&#39;re pretty much ready. The only bad thing is that Dad found the key to the freezer and I must go cookieless until Christmas Eve :-(.</p>
<p>Things in layaway have slowed down considerably. Thursday and Friday were a nightmare but since I couold count on my hands and toes how many people have come through to get stuff. Sunday night I began learning the how to operate the register and I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t want to do that (for reasons I don&#39;t want to go into again :-P). On Monday I&#39;ll be discussing my future at Wal-Mart with a manager and depending on if there&#39;s any other spots open or not I&#39;ll either be a cashier or a cart pusher. If I could do cashiering back in electronics I&#39;d probably leap on it, otherwise I&#39;ll probably push carts (unless overnight socker is available). But anyways, it looks like I&#39;m not even going to get laid off before coming back (I must have made a good impression).</p>
<p>But now I must go and make another attempt at finding the freezer key (or something :-P). Merry Christmas :-D</p>
