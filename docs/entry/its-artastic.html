Then I stopped. Not sure why, but here are some of the fruits of that (and other) endeavors.</p>
<p>[gallery=May 2009 Art]<img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Maya_and_Kay.JPG" alt="" title="Maya Fey and Kay Faraday. Capcom can&#39;t turn down an opportunity to have a teenage, female sidekick in their games, apparently. Not that I&#39;m complaining, mind you."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Hanako.jpg" alt="" title="This is the fruit of me subconsciously doodling the same character while I was working on poses. I named her Hanako, but used the wrong kanji in the picture. Some Japanese person is laughing at me right now."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Yui_Hirasawa.jpg" alt="" title="Yui Hirasawa of K-ON fame. Arguably my favorite character in the show as she&#39;s the cutest (in both appearances and personality). I realized as I was watching an episode of K-ON the other night that the show is missing a tsundere character.... and that with no men, there&#39;s no place for one."><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Azusa.jpg" alt="" title="Azusa, again from K-ON. I drew portraits of all five main characters over the aforementioned week, but Yui and Azusa are the only one&#39;s I&#39;ve colored thus far as they were arguably the best sketched. Not sure if I&#39;ll upload others later.">[/gallery]</p>
<p>There you have it. Enjoy!</p>
