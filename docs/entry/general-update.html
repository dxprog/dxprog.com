I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all thinking because we&#39;re moving. Well, sadly, that guy who was so interested seems more interested in renting, not buying (stinks :-P).</p>
<p>But, anyways. Today I began studying for the GED. It&#39;s not quite as simple as I thought, but I basically finish high school in one run as opposed to another two or so years.</p>
<p>Things on Desert Planet (the online game I mentioned earlier) is coming along quite nicely. I&#39;m in charge if designing and implementing the interface (putting to use those Ajax skills I picked up recently). You can check out what there is of the game <a href="http://www.d.chaospowers.com/test">here.</a></p>
<p>I spent most of yesterday keeping track of hurricane Katrina. I&#39;m not really surprised that New Orleans is a total wasteland. Let&#39;s face it: They built the thing on the coast below sea level. They were asking for it (not to mention Mardi Gras :-P). Soddam and Gamorah all over again. However, I did donate some money to the relief fund because I&#39;m sure those people are going through heck and every little bit can help. If you&#39;re interested in helping check out the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a>.</p>
