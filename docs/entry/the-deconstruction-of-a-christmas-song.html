So, given the spirit of the season, I shell delve into Christmas related subject. Today, I will be violently tearing apart a Christmas song (no, not the Nat King Cole one).</p>
<p>On the whole, I enjoy Christmas music. Arguably, I don&#39;t quite as much now as I did in my younger years, but it still is an important part of the season. There are, however, some songs I cannot stand. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a_Y1wAJ2MU">Christmas Shoes</a> ranks pretty high on that list, for example. And, of course, let us not forget songs about  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTNheCEUP_A#t=15s">attempted Christmas date rape</a>. Not to mention that song that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33o32C0ogVM">ISN&#39;T EVEN A FUCKING CHRISTMAS SONG!!!</a></p>
<p>Sorry, that one always hits a nerve.</p>
<p>Today, however, I will discuss <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWVU7ZbbVps">Do You Hear What I Hear?</a>. Aside from being incredibly repetitive and musically <em>blah</em>, the lyrics (when over-analysed) make about as much sense as mayonnaise taking a brisk vacation on the shores of Hawaii. So, let&#39;s begin![break]</p>
<p><strong>Said the night wind to the little lamb</strong>
Because air particles can talk and animals comprehend their mutterings. I&#39;ll let this one slide because I watch shows where <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/midori-kasugano/">humans</a> can replace <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/">other humans extremities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A star passing in the night with a tail as big as a kite</strong>
Multiple things going wrong here. Firstly, stars don&#39;t have tails. Those are comets (I will also allow meteors). Secondly, should that be &quot;a tail as big as a kite&#39;s&quot; comparing the tails of both objects, or are we actually comparing the tail of the &quot;star&quot; to the body of the kite? Because kites are not that large and I am left unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy</strong>
Why the hell not? The lamb is already getting its daily news from the wind...</p>
<p><strong>With a voice as big as the sea</strong>
Another sad comparison here. You can&#39;t compare physical size with perceived volume. They are on two totally different scales. I was actually going to try and figure out what this would equate to in decibels given the size of some sea, but quit when I realized the answer would regardless blow out your eardrums. You can amazingly fix this lyric by changing out the word &quot;big&quot; for &quot;loud&quot;. Not only does it still fit the rhythm of the song, but now it makes sense!</p>
<p><strong>A child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold</strong>
You know... I can (almost) appreciate the thought here. But, how about bringing a more immediately solution... like maybe a goddamn blanket. We&#39;ve established that poor baby Jesus is freezing his buns off so, obviously, the solution is to bring him cold metal. It&#39;d be a shame if he were to <strong>die</strong> of hypothermia before he can enjoy those precious metals. Luckily, he&#39;s Jesus and will forgive your stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>The king&#39;s declaration to the &quot;people everywhere&quot;</strong>
In a nutshell, this lyric has the kind from the previous stanza declaring to his subjects that Jesus is going to save the world.</p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s think about this for a second. Wasn&#39;t Herod king at this point? Wasn&#39;t his first act upon hearing about Jesus to [b]<em>slaughter</em>[/b] all male children up to the age of two? Isn&#39;t turning this blind eye towards history the same thing as the holocaust deniers? And yet this song is not only accepted, but no doubt sang in buildings of worship. Amazing.</p>
<p>Before you get all pissed off writing a nasty comment about how I &quot;don&#39;t get it,&quot; I do understand the intention of the song. I&#39;m just a snarky asshole and that&#39;s how I roll.</p>
<p>Later, bitches :D</p>
