<p>Finished both the Hobbit and Madoka 2 tonight. This was probably my most enjoyable read of the Hobbit, knowing the story of LotR and also just being old enough to understand it all. Still, I found Tolkien&#39;s prose to be a highly annoying in places. His odd phrasings and lack of correct comma usage made some bits difficult to read. But even so, enjoyable nontheless.</p>
