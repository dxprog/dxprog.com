WHOOOO!!</a></h2><time>December 15, 2005</time><div><p>Ah.... I sit in the living room in a nice comfy chair as I write this. Yes.. I got my laptop out this morning. I stayed up all night to do it, but I did it and DANGif it isn&#39;t a darn nice feeling :-). I&#39;ve got a bunch of junk I&#39;m going to need to uninstall (currently there are 14 icons down on the system tray :-P). But at least I&#39;ve got a processor/RAM combo that can handle a bunch of stuff :-D.</p>
<p>This is a bittersweet feeling, though, because today is the day that all Christmas layaway&#39;s are due out. It&#39;s probably going to be a hellacious afternoon/evening but at least I&#39;ll have something nice to come to tonight :-). That said, though, it may not be so bad because we&#39;ve got an orderly system in place. From what I understand I&#39;ll come in, pick up a car with somebody&#39;s layaway, get it and bring it in. That is a far cry from going to to get 5+ layaway&#39;s at a time :-P.</p>
<p>But, now I must fiddle with junk. BABEE! :-D</p>
