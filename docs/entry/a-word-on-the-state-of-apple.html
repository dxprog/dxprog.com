Despite the fact that Windows is easily installed thanks to the magic of Boot Camp, I&#39;ve been working in OS X mostly. I feel I&#39;ve been using it long enough to give my opinion:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use. Once I figured out the basics I pretty much got it.</li>
<li>Stability (for the most part). A few minutes ago Safari died an ugly death on me dragging the rest of the system down with it and I&#39;ve been in a must reboot situation twice (not including the system updates)</li>
<li>Pretty looking. Hey, what can I say? I&#39;m a sucker for the genie effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple&#39;s interface guidlines tend to make apps overly simplistic. Toolbars are almost non-existant, everything seems to revolve around a drag and drop interface. This is an area where Windows apps can really shine given a developer who knows what they are doing.</li>
<li>Keyboard craziness. I don&#39;t know about you, but I use the Home and End keys to navigate through text boxes all the time. Albiet, it&#39;s still there (Cmd-Left and Right respectively), but pressing two keys (or three if I want to make a selection) is a lot harder. Also, they seemed to ignore the delete key as well. I&#39;m not a mouse person and I don&#39;t want to drag my effin&#39; files to the trash. I want to press delete (and Enter to close the resulting dialog box).</li>
<li>Unix directory structure. Windows can be incredibly clean in directory structure if done right. Unix is much, much more difficult and half the folders you can&#39;t see anyways. Also, mountpoints drive me nuts (although, OS X seems to keep track of all that fairly well).</li>
<li>Finally, hardware support. They tell you &quot;it just works&quot; but that&#39;s a lie. There are no drivers for my scanner (forcing me to use a piece of shareware), minimal support for my printer, NO support for my flash drive just to name a few. Driver support is something people complain about in Windows, but I have never, EVER had a problem with hardware in XP.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now that I&#39;m through with that I&#39;ll deliver my verdict: Windows XP SP2 is the best OS ever (and I&#39;ve used Vista so I can rule that one out). That said, OS X is definitely the best flavor of Unix I&#39;ve ever seen and I can get along with it nicely.</p>
