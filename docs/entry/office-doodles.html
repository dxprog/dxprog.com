Instead, today I&#39;m going to present to you some things I&#39;ve doodled at various points while at work. Sadly, some of my more epic doodles are in a different notepad and will not be presented here today, and seeing as I&#39;m on vacation for the next week I can&#39;t just wait until Monday to write this. But, enough said. The artwork is after the break.[break]</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_bullet.jpg" alt="" title="Mr. Bullet says...">I used to draw a lot of these little visual puns while in college. Had to keep the tradition alive.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_apollo.jpg" alt="" title="iObject">Sketched while I was waiting for my computer to boot. I was in the middle of completing all the Ace Attorney games back to back to back which was probably why it was on the brain that day.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_girl.jpg" alt="" title="Maya Fey?">I honestly don&#39;t even remember drawing this, but there it is. Not terrible, to be sure. Kind of looks like Maya from Ace Attorney, I guess.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_hanako_snow.jpg" alt="" title="Look familiar?">This was the doodle that directly inspired <a href="http://dxprog.com/entry/because-its-far-too-warm-for-november/">this picture</a>. I&#39;m torn on which one is better.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.dxprog.com/blog/office_doodles_snowman.jpg" alt="" title="The flying sombreros are attacking! Somebody save the tacos!">Just randomness. In case you&#39;re wondering, the text says &quot;Snow-me-ha-me-ha!&quot;, a less than subtle nod to Dragon Ball Z</p>
