At least, not within the span of a month.</p>
<p>This morning, as a friend and I were biking our disappointment of not biking away, he made a comment about attempting to hit 500 miles by the end of the month. Though I grunted an agreement, my thoughts were skeptical. However, as I was biking this evening, attempting to bring my total milage for the week above my goal of 50, I considered how I might go about this without killing myself.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it wouldn&#39;t be all bad.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider that today is the 7th and that I have 23 more days with which to achieve my goal. I&#39;ve already biked 51.7 miles, so that leaves <em>only</em> 448.3 miles to go. Let&#39;s crack out some math:</p>
<p><strong>448.3 / 23 = ~19.5 miles per day</strong></p>
<p>Might seem high, but actually quite attainable. Let&#39;s break it down piece by piece.</p>
<p>Five days a week, I can bike to work from home. It&#39;s about 6.3 miles in each direction, so that&#39;d be 12.6 miles. Lately, I&#39;ve been enjoying doing an end-to-end-and-back-again ride on my street, which is just shy of ten miles even. So, on any given work day, I could bike 22.5 miles. With 17 work days left in the month, that would be:</p>
<p><strong>22.5 * 17 = 382.5</strong></p>
<p>Now to figure out the other 65.8 miles.</p>
<p>One way to do this would to simply continue my ten mile evening ride on the weekends. There are six weekend days left in the month, so that&#39;d be 60 miles. Of course, there&#39;s no reason why I couldn&#39;t do something a little longer, such as a bike to San Jose and back. On average, these run about 20 miles, so trade out one ten mile ride for that and I&#39;m already there.</p>
<p>But, let&#39;s assume I don&#39;t want to bike <em>every</em> day. Let&#39;s also assume that I&#39;ll be doing some riding from San Mateo (because I most certainly will).</p>
<p>The ride from San Mateo to Mountain View is on the order of 25.5 miles. Were I to do just one of those per week (let&#39;s assume Tuesdays), I could get four of those in. Here&#39;s the new workday break down:</p>
<p><strong>13 <em> 12.6 + 4 </em> 25.5 + 4 <em> 6.3 + 17 </em> 10 = 461</strong></p>
<p>So, that&#39;s 13 days of biking to and from home and work, four days of San Mateo -&gt; work -&gt; home, and then doing that short ten mile ride every evening. Suddenly, my weekends are free to collapse onto the couch and do nothing :D. Now, let&#39;s see how many calories this would burn (using some quickly head-calculated averages):</p>
<p><strong>13 <em> 500 + 4 </em> 850 + 4 <em> 250 + 17 </em> 300 = 16,000 calories</strong></p>
<p>So, basically 16 Taco Bell box meals if I don&#39;t drink soda. But, in actuality, I could eat more.</p>
<p>Because just living also burns calories...</p>
