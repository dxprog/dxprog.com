I’ll also include the read-alouds I&#39;m doing with the four hundred college kids since I am actually reading those.</p>
<p><em>## School Read Alouds:</em></p>
<p>A Presentation on Web Development at LinkedIn (for Full Sail)</p>
<p><em>## Personal Reading:</em></p>
<p>Attack on Titan
Game of Thrones
Puella Magi Oriko Magica</p>
<p><em>## Books I&#39;ve Finished Reading:</em></p>
<p>Boys of Summer (an unpublished novel written by my old boss, good shit)</p>
<p>So that’s what&#39;s in piles around the house. What I&#39;m really missing right now is a good, solid nap. The only sleeping I do is about five hours overnight and my daily nap and that makes me sad. I miss those toddler/preschool/teenager days of sleeping till noon.</p>
<p>What about you – sleeping well?</p>
