Comment posting still doesn&#39;t work and the &quot;My Digg&quot; bar is broken, but I think this is probably one of the best designs I&#39;ve had in a while. But don&#39;t take my word for it, <a href="http://www.dxprog.com/pics/new_design.png">see for yourselves.</a> The comic page is also done in this style, though it&#39;s not quite working yet.</p>
