Not much new going on over here. I&#39;m still doing the Clear Creek site (sparked an idea for an ASP.NET wiki :-D). Also, did a bunch of work for the Schindler&#39;s again. Made a profitable $50 off of it which I&#39;ve promptly used to buy myself a 120GB hard drive. Oh, and I got a free $20 Amazon.com gift certificate for taking a [<a href="http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link">http://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/link</a>] survey. I&#39;ll probably buy Episode III with that (totally free :-D).</p>
<p>Jeff bought Jedi Academy last week. Awesome, awesome game that one is. Never thought I could get into an FPS, but I did. It&#39;s $10 software so if you see it I recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>That seems to be all. I know, short entry for such a long reprieve. Until next time :-P</p>
