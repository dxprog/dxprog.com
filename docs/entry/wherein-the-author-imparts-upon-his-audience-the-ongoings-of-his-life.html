So I take leave of my busy life, if only for a moment, to fill you, the reader, in on the various happenings and goings on. (Okay, that&#39;s enough eighteen hundreds talk).</p>
<p>So, Christmas has come and gone (as it always does) and I am now back into the thick of school. Luckily, I don&#39;t have all sucky courses this month. No, I only have one. However, let&#39;s put the good news before the bad, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>ADG</strong>
Advanced Computer Graphics, or ADG, is probably the second best course I&#39;ve had thus far (<a href="http://www.dxprog.com/entry/into-the-christmas-swing-amongst-other-things/">NOS</a> being number one). ADG is, more or less, a Photoshop/Illustrator class. DCG was also this to a slight degree, but more emphasis was placed on the actual design as opposed to technical issues. Now, however, we&#39;re in the thick of opacity masks, and layer styles, and blah, blah, blah. Actually, believe it or not, I&#39;ve become more comfortable in Illustrator than I am in Photoshop. The pen tool, simply put, is the most brilliant thing since aged cheese. But don&#39;t take my word for it, take my art:</p>
<p>[gallery=NES]<img src="http://img00.deviantart.net/244b/i/2008/021/2/e/nes_vector_illustration_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="An NES created using nothing but vector shapes"><img src="http://img09.deviantart.net/07b2/i/2008/021/3/1/nes_advertisment_by_dxprog.jpg" alt="" title="Using the image from before and placing it into an ad.">[/gallery]</p>
<p>It should be duly noted that the NES is not, in fact, a photograph. Nor was it some fancy job I did in Photoshop. No, it was done completely in Illustrator and, vector graphics being what they are, is infinitely scalable. The advertisement, however, is not. Oh, and speaking of which, I realize that the NES is pushing twenty-three.</p>
<p>My other course is geometry and I will leave you simply with this: proofs can burn in Hell.</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;d like to say real quick: iPod Touch is the best PDA ever created. I know. I own one. Damn you Apple, damn you.</p>
<p>My site is still riding on a wave of hits from the Rock Band drums thing way back when, but I&#39;ve had another surge in popularity thanks to <a href="http://andrewrudson.com/main.php">this guy</a>. He&#39;s created one nicely polished drum kit app and has kindly linked back to my page. It&#39;d be wrong for me not to return the favor.</p>
<p>Finally, while I&#39;m throwing out links, be sure to check out the newly revamped <a href="http://www.game-boyz.net/">Game Boyz</a>. While you&#39;re at it, why don&#39;t you sign up on the forums and tell my bro how awesome the comic is.</p>
<p>Well, that should appease the masses for the well being. I write these posts in hope that somebody is reading them, however, even if it just serves as a chronicle of my life for me to read later, then so be it. It&#39;s deep tomes of history have already provided me with hours of cringing agony. May it continue to do so in this grand a glorious new year.</p>
