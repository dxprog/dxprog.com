Spawned from yet another conversation with a certain Mr. Helton.

There is partial truth to this comic; the extra two grand that went into my eye surgery over standard LASIK involved additional scans to increase the accuracy of my prescription. Also, it was bladeless, which was a far easier idea to stomach.

Also, journal entries shall show up at some point. I lost the journal I was on somewhere while cleaning up after the move. The irony is, I had set it aside after unpacking it from its box...
