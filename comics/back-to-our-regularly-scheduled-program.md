Let us all celebrate the glorious return of my most shitty comic, Digital Double. My split personality counterparts will once again grace the interwebs, much to the ill of the general populace. I am most sincerely sorry!

In more seriousness, it felt good to make a comic again.

Also, naps are destroying my life.
