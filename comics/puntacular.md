I know a maximum of three possible people who will actually understand this (myself not included). It's a play on words of a popular game/anime series in Japan called [The Idolmaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolmaster). Couldn't actually make it through the show, myself. Even I have my limit on bubbly middle school girls.
