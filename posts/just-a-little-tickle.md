I missed a couple of days, so sue me. I'll just run a couple days longer to make up the slack. At least I'm not doing some revisionist history nonsense like my mother...

Yeah, I've been busy, both in the realms of socializing and in reality. Been pulling together the bare minimum number of puzzle pieces I'm comfortable with for getting Hakk's Lab off the ground. The garage is in a good state and this morning I began filming. Not happy with any of the takes I did, so I'm probably going to write out a small script.

In the mean time, that project has actual work that needs to be thrown at it. I will tease below.
