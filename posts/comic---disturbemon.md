[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics)

Haven't made one of these in a while. I was digging through some of my old stuff the other day and found my little comic ideas notebook. I always did like this one and I'm not sure why I never made it. This and [Pikachunks](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54176/) were actually written at the same time and were supposed to "air" back to back. But, anyhoo...

Since I can't use Photoshop anymore and since GIMP sucks I had to ink the comic by hand. BY HAND! Actually, it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. Not to say that it is without problems but it works.
