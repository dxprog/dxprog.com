[quote]In less than 36 hours, I will again be able to dip my toes in the vast ocean of the internet. It is a moment I eagerly await.

Yesterday was the most difficult day yet. It was a dreadfully slow day at work which left me wanting to surf the old stand bys (reddit, youtube, facebook, etc.) Instead, I spent time combing the news sites, reading articles, and contemplating performance improvements.

At home, things aren't so bad. I can nap or read or whatever. I've nearly finished all of my Toradora manga, leaving Oreimo and Yotsuba on my high priority pile.

One day...[/quote]
