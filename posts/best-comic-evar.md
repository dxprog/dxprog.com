I'm not sure how many of you (all three of ya) saunter over to [my bro's site](http://www.revo-news.frih.net/), but if you don't you're really missing out because it is home to one of the best web comics on the net (and I'm not just saying that to be nice). [Today's comic](http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060515/) is what made me say "Hey! I need to share this with people!". So go check it out, keep checking it out, it's all good.

As for my own comic don't expect the next one till Tuesday. I don't even have the thing scribbled out on paper yet let alone coloered and all that malarkey :-P.
