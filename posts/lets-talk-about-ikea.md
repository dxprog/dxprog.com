Was looking on IKEA's website for a cheap cart that I could use for the coffee equipment at the new office. While getting there, I ran into this gem of a photo:

So many questions.

Why is she holding a dirty spoon? She's clearly not cooking as can be noted by the exceptionally clean counters.

What exactly is she doing? Singing into her dirty spoon?

Where is the oven? Were there any dishes around, I'd expect to see maybe a chocolate cake or brownies... but there doesn't seem to be a place to cook them.

Her outfit seems very 90s. Denim jumper thing with leggings. Hell, the might even be stirrup pants and the stirrups are covered by socks.

It's a curious thing.
