> It's been nearly twenty-four hours since I last surfed the social web. Despite the cravings I've had to see how my karma seeds are growing, I haven't found it too difficult to not turn the computer on. At work, I kept myself busy with actual work and these math/programming challenges Mickael dug up. At home, I did wind up watching HIMYM because I didn't feel like torrenting it next week. But since, I've kept myself busy with a walk to Wal-mart, making and consuming pumpkin bread, and gratuitous reading. Now, I am drawing myself a batch and will probably read and then turn in.
