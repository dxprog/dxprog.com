So good to be back at my computer with a real keyboard and a copy of Photoshop with which to make stupid blog headers.

So, in my [previous post](http://dxprog.com/entry/ipadly-thing), I mentioned a particular game called SeaGlass. It is, or at least attempts to be, a Tetris Attack type clone. It's obvious that there was no love or effort put into this game and, being my [favorite game of all time](http://dxprog.com/entry/welcome_to_the_week_of_top_5/), it makes me sad inside.

I simply cannot stand for this.

So, as I am already in a heated battle with my much maligned [younger brother](http://twitter.com/#!/linkman2004) developing just such a game, I will scrap the XNA codebase I've spent some evenings working on and move over to the iOS platform for development. Using the [Airplay SDK](http://www.airplaysdk.com/), I will create a game for the App Store that is a truly worthy entry to the game series it plays homage to.

That and I can charge 99 cents and make a tiny profit. Really, this is me testing the mobile development world with an application I am already [quite familiar with](http://dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/). I've been wanting to break into the arena for some time and this is where it begins.
