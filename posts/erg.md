Well, I got my games today (after an eternity of waiting) and surprise, surprise they're pirated copies :-@. I'm hoping I can get a refund and if I can't get that I hope at least that these games won't fritz on me immediatly. But, my ALttP cart (which I learned is also pirated) hasn't gone nutzy on me yet, so maybe if I'm lucky I'll still be playing these when I'm 50 :-P.

I've finished with my changes to the [parish site](http://www.parishofstpeter.net). I had a fun journey into RSS land and the nightmares of PHP's XML handling came back to haunt me as well :-P. I also decided to put up scanned copies of the bulletin due to the format changes it undergoes each week. It makes me look like a hypocrite because a couple weeks ago the guy who runs the Our Lady of Guadelupe site was on my case for not getting the bulletin up-to-date and was talking about how he just scanned theirs in. I stupidly answered "Nah, that's cheating. I couldn't do that." Well, I did it. However, in my defense, I have a high quality, lossless scan whereas his, well, [you make the call](http://www.ourladyofguadalupe-dewey.org/bulletin.htm).

This afternoon mom and I are going to look at houses (my opinion is highly valued ;-)). With any luck we'll find something spacious enough for us at a decent price. Maybe tomorrow I'll post on how all that went, but until then...
