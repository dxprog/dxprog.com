It's been nearly a month since I last posted anything of relevance. A lot had happened since then. I've completed my first month of school and, as such, my first set of classes. Now I won't pretend to understand I know how a traditional college works but I do know that Full Sail's approach is much different (and, in my opinion, much more sensical). Every month we have two courses that we attend for four weeks. These are broken down into, generally, five eight-hour days per week with few breaks in between save major holidays. This is how we pull off a four year degree in only twenty-one months. These five day weeks are broken down into one subject being done three days and the other two. This month I was lucky enough to only have four days of school per week but all I did were gen ed classes, namely art history and english composition.

**Art History**
Art history was interesting if nothing else. We got see all sorts of art from various periods of time starting with the cave men and their wall paintings. My favorite eras were definitely the Renaissance and Baroque. It is rare to find an artist that skilled these days. The Greeks were awesome as well with all their master marble working. The only problem with them, however, is their crazy preoccupation with penises. I could've done without that, thank you very much. We also took a trip to the Orlando Museum of Art. Some pretty interesting stuff their from ancient artifacts up to Andy Warhols. But, the best part of the whole thing was when we had to make our own pieces of art emulating other styles and then have them displayed in front of the whole class. A lot of good laughs shared there. Here's my pieces:

For this we were supposed to do a cave painting using a movie as the theme. Fifty points to the person who can correctly name the movie.

I was shooting for cubism but wound up pulling a weird combo of things, namely cubism, abstract, and pop art. I like it, though.

**English Comp**
This is the course I've been sweating through the most. Though I have a better than average grasp of English and grammar, primarily through keeping this blog and a lot of reading, I felt that my writing was too erratic and too concise to pull off this class successfully. Luckily we only had to write three papers (four if you include the ungraded one we wrote at the beginning of the course). They were each a different kind of paper, these being a memoir, a print ad analysis, and a research argument. We've also had to do some group presentations in front of the class. The last of these almost got seriously screwed up because we misread our little topic card. About ten minutes before we did our presentation we realized this and were scrambling to come up with relevant information. We wound up just pulling the whole thing out of our asses at the last minute but still managed a one hundred. I'm surprised points weren't taken off for my visible knee shaking.

On the whole I've been having a good time considering that I'm in school learning stuff. I've made a bunch of friends and at that ones who are in the same boat I am, meaning they can quote the [300 PG trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqiSkd1M6k). Next week I get to look forward to designing computer graphics and networks and operating systems as my courses. Should be awesome.
