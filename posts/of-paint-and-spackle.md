Yesteray began day one of the house rennovating project. I was out helping mom with little kids but I plan on staying next Saturday to be the Supervisor from Hell(R) :-D. Some sanding and spackle jobs done by the teens who are pulling this off was... well, not professional. And while I don't expect them to be perfect, painting over screws and nails is not acceptable.

Saw an [interesting article](http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,120341,pg,1,00.asp) about how people ranked their ISP. SBC was pretty up there and, to my joy, AOL was dead last. Guess I'm not the only one who thinks of it as **AO**-he**L**.
