The clock says 9:55pm and I have, more or less, just awoken from an evening nap... that lasted two hours. I make no secret of the amount of time I spend napping, but generally it's 20-30 minutes. Two hours is excessive and it's now eaten away at time that I was going to spend working on my bracket app.

I'm not entirely sure why I'm so prone to napping. The most obvious thing to me would be the fact that I keep such terrible hours. My alarm begins going off at 6:20am so I can snooze it a couple of times before rolling into work not too long after 7am. My final sleep generally begins around 12am-1am, which leaves five to six hours for actual sleep. The nap could exist as a little pick me up to make it just a bit farther.

I've also theorized that my job could be part of the reason. Dealing with office work and software development is more taxing than one might think for something that keeps you immobile for nearly 9 hours. Given that my brain has been running at high capacity for that time, once I return home, everything just grinds to a halt. I flop on the couch, flick on the TV, and basically do nothing for the remained of the evening. That is, unless I have some sort of deadline to meet in a project I'm working on.

My final thoughts concerning the naps, somewhat related to the above, is that I may be suffering from mild depression. When I'm at home, lying in my bed, it sometimes takes quite a feat to do anything. I don't feel like playing a video game, or reading a book, or watching TV, or any numerous things that require nearly zero physical or cognitive effort. Hell, sometimes it's so bad I'll even let my stomach go hungry because I don't want to move to make food. Instead I'll just lie in my bed drifting in and out of sleep, going through this same mental cycle as my mind breaches into consciousness. I'm not entirely settled on the depression idea as I've seen real depression play out. I'm a pretty content person most of the time, so I think this is more extreme laziness than anything else.

Alright, there's more words!
