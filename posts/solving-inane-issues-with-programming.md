I'm slowly running out of things to say for the remainder of the month and the most interesting stuff is still five days out. Also, my brother and I have run out of things to watch, having finished seven seasons of How I Met Your Mother and rewatched both seasons of Higurashi in about a couple months. We're about to start watching Clannad again, but there's actually a simple solution to both of these problems.

And that solution is programming.

I may have mentioned before, but about half a mile up from work is a branch of the local library. They have a pretty decent collection of Blu-rays. So, I wrote a [small script](http://pastebin.com/1H0gZ6XY) to scrape all the [blu-ray titles](http://pastebin.com/ix4Px68c) at that location and, at random, pick four movies for us to watch. Here's what it came up with:

1. Seven Years in Tibet 
2. Star Trek - The Motion Picture
3. The Silence of the Lambs 
4. 9

Number 4 was originally _Superman Returns_, but my brother and I have already seen that and so decided to reroll.

I suppose out of a data set of only 460+ there was bound to be one movie I'd recognize, but not all four.

So, each day on my lunch break, I will bravely trek up to the library to fetch one of these discs. If one shouldn't be available, I'll move to the next item on the list. If I go past the end, a new movie will be randomly selected. This movie will then be watched and I will give a short review of my feelings at the end.

Seriously, being a programmer is akin to being a wizard in the Harry Potter world. I don't know how you muggles make it...
