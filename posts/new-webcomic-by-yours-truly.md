It's something I've been hankering to do for quite some time now (ever since I started reading [CAD](http://www.cad-comic.com/), really). Jeff's been making them for some time now (he should be posting them on this blog at some point) and Chris has had his Hackfam's for years. So now I bring to you F5, the "adventures" of two programmers:

I'm working on completing the first strip and hopefully I'll have it posted some time tomorrow or Sunday. It'll probably be a weekly thing as getting the comic pulled together is an incredibly time consuming process. Stay tuned for more :-).
