Received this message on Facebook from a buddy of mine today:

> Did you see (and I am NOT making this up) OCTOSHARK on SCI-FI last night.  I mean the (so called) special effects were anything but!  You with a crayon and a piece of paper drawing the title creature could have made a scarier one.

I'm never one to turn down a challenge like that, so I give you the terror of the deep, Sharktopus!

Trailer for the horror in question can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2HGoR8pSps&feature=player_embedded#!).
