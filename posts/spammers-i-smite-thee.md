Once again people have thought it fun to spam my blog. To this I say: Burn in hell, you dirty bastards! But, oh well. I've added some interesting features to the comment system that should keep them at bay... unless they actually write a bot to target my site specifically. But, in the meantime, the comments are back up and running. No crazy password, approval e-mail, or word verification necessary. That's how proud I am of my coding. That and the fact that I can't seem to programtically send e-mails on my server. It sucks. Hardcore.

Also, you'll notice that the RSS feed is back so subscribe and never miss out on my awesome news again. Peace out!
