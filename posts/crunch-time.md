Well, we've had an offer, the papers are signed and with any luck the moving will commence soon. So for those of you out there who pray please add in an extra word to the man upstairs that all this goes through :-).

Bowling league starts again in a couple weeks (13th) which I am looking forward to. Dad and I had been on a Monday league over the summer, but it was with "commoners" (i.e. people who come and bowl every now and again) and the atmosphere was.... common :-P. Now we'll be in a USBCC sanctioned league again with all our bowling buddies from last year :-D.

I will be updating in as much as I can. Stay tuned. Now back to our regularly scheduled program...
