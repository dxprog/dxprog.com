As you may recall a few months back I released unto the world my envisioning of an [NES Guitar Hero commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxG2pjo_3HU). If I recall correctly I complained about directing my younger brothers in the video. Well, I guess I can quit complaining... because now they're international movie stars!

This is taken from the pages of [Ngamer Magazine (Brazil Edition)](http://www.europanet.com.br/euro2003/modelos/exibe_img.php?img=/image_gen/resizeimg.php?cod_produto=75002&size=w500) and was kindly sent in by YouTuber, muzinfa (thanks, bro). It's quite awesome that somebody was tickled enough to put it in their publication but the fact that it also crossed the language barrier is doubley sweet.
