While we're not mentioned directly (at the parents request) the local paper, Examiner Enterprise (aka Teh Typo Tymes), [ran an article](http://www.examiner-enterprise.com/articles/2005/06/30/lifestyles_and_entertainment/c588.txt) on the group that's been helping us get the house whipped into shape. Now this is a crummy recreation of what's in the paper, but until I can get all the pictures scanned and stuff this'll have to do.

But enough of the nicey, nice stuff. Tomorrow they're coming again to finish the painting but this time _I'm_ here. Bwa ha ha ha! I AM MATTBERT, EVIL DIRECTOR OF QUALITY CONTROL! BWA HA HA!! It's not quite done yet, but I've even rigged up a Dilbert style self-portrait of myself (which I will have online once the UDM is finished).

Speaking of which, the UDM is coming along quite nicely. I got a ton of work done today and everything is looky pretty spanky! You can take a [looksee](http://tetra.dyndns.org/docs) if you want.

Well, I need to get some sleep so I have plenty of energy for whip cracking... I mean.. painting tomorrow ;-). G'night!
