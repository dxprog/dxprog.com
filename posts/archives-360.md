I'm sure you've noticed the archives bar over there so I will swiftly move on to a cooler topic.

As the title suggests I own an Xbox 360. Now I can proudly call myself a Wii60 person. I've been wanting one for a while mainyl for the Halo series but also it's extensive online cataloge of awesomeness. For instance I can download HD quality Headlines clips... FREE! It freakin' owns. The only thing that's going to come back to haunt me some day is the small hard drive. I could've bought an Elite but I got a Premium instead. I stupid. I own Crackdown and Halo 2. I was originally just going to rent Crackdown (for the H3 beta of course) but I tried the demo and was like "Hey, this isn't a bad game" so I bought it. Of course, I haven't necessarily been playing these games. No, I've been playing Phoenic Wright 1. It still kicks ass. In fact I'd go so far as to say that case number four was my favorite yet.

Well, I could go on about such things for a long time, but I think I shall get soome sleep.
