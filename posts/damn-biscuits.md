I had the top 5 post all written up and something went screwy when trying to post it. Now it's gone. Lost forever in the digital mines of hell. I'll give you the basic rundown without the commentary because I don't feel like typing it again.

Top 5 Games I Can't Wait For

5. Final Fantasy VI DS (not confirmed, but you know it's coming)
4. Pheonix Wright: Trials and Tribulations
3. Eternal Sonata
2. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass
1. Super Smash Bros Brawl

I'm going to have to reserve some money because these all come out within the first couple months of school.
