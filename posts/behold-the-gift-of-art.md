As a kind of quick Merry Christmas to anybody reading this blog, I bring to you some of my latest art pieces. I'm thinking perhaps that an art section on the gallery page might be a good idea, but in the mean time you can enjoy it right here or on my [deviantArt page](http://dxprog.deviantart.com/). But, I digress.
[gallery=December 2009 Art]![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Midori_Kasugano.jpg "The colerized version of my Midori sketch from a few months back. My reference image was in black and white which left me to figure out the shading and such for this picture. That's why it looks like her hair is a lettuce leaf...")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Ryou_and_Nagisa.jpg "Ryou and Nagisa from the visual novel/anime CLANNAD. I suppose this could be considered bordering on yuri, in face my brother Jeff walked in as I was drawing and said "That's not platonic...". It is, of course, and who should know better than the artist? Subject matter aside, I consider this a large step up in terms of coloring and shading for me, trying out some new things.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Nagisa_Winter.jpg "Nagisa again, this time from the After Story part of CLANNAD. I have to admit that I cheated a little on this one: I didn't sketch the line art myself. I instead traced a screen grab and did all the coloring (I wanted this as a desktop wallpaper). It actually was quite the learning experience as I'd not done coloring of this caliber before and I got a lot of things figured out. I hope to begin using these techniques for my own art in the near future.")[/gallery]
I hope everybody had a Merry Christmas and will have an awesome New Year!
