One of the more mundane things that happened over Christmas break was my learning how to solve the Rubik's cube. My ability to do so was actually big thing in math class the following month. Since then, I've been improving upon my technique and now I'm going to show you how to solve Rubik's Cube in ten seconds or less. Video after the break.[break]
