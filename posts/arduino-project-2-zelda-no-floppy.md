I can't really take too much credit for pulling this one together as I just followed a magnificent [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6tuMn5sPyM), but here is my arduino hooked up to a lone floppy drive (only one I have, currently) pumping out some Zelda music. I will be adding more drives soon and doing some additional fanciness. Yes...
