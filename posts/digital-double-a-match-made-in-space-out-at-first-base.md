[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/56546/)

So our tale of love and romance comes to a crashing conclusion... literally. Actually, this was the idea that inspired the whole idea in the first place.

It should be duly noted that Master Chief's real name is in fact John (or John-117). In the original comic it was just Chief, but at the prompting of a friend of mine it was changed to John. I figured he ought to know as he's finished both games and read the books (whereas I'm not even halfway through the first game. I just play multiplayer all the time).

I was thinking about having a Cortana episode where she's jealous and such, but drawing Master Chief is kind of a bitch (as you probably have figured out) so I'm wrapping it up here.
