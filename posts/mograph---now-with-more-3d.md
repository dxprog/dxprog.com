Over the last couple of months I've been served a delicious helping of 3D stuffs at school. This was, of course, overshadowed by the awesomeness that was Flash. But I digress. At the end of this month our final 3D project wound up in an awesome culmination of 3D animation and my favorite motion program, After Effects. The result? See for yourself.
