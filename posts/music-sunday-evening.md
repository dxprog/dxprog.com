My mom does this thing on her blog called "music monday" where she chooses some song and then writes about the lyrics and how it relates to her or discussing the meaning. I'm going to do that, but with two changes:

- it's Sunday
- the song I'm choosing is sung in Gaelic and I have no idea what it means

## The Best is Yet to Come - Metal Gear Solid

_The Best is Yet to Come_ is the song you hear upon completing Metal Gear Solid. It begins playing after we've watched Snake and Meryl (or Otacon, if you fucked up) take off across the snow swept plains of Alaska. It's a lovely and haunting piece that captures the exact essence of "Alaskan Plains".

I first heard this song back in college upon completing Metal Gear Solid for the first time. You could say it was love at first... hear? and made it straight into rotation. I have a particularly vivid memory of a long walk on the Cady Way Trail on my way to deposit a living expense check. There's a point on the trail where it runs through a bunch of trees, making it feel like walking through a tree tunnel. This was on a particularly fall-like day, with the leaves turning various shades of orange and brown, and there was even a slight crisp feeling to the air. _The Best is Yet to Come_ began playing on my phone/mp3 player and provided the most perfect music accompaniment to the scene laid out around me. Almost made the 8 mile round trip bearable...

Every year around the fall/winter months, I put this song back into rotation. Playing it a little more than usual this year, not sure why. Perhaps because it accentuates what little there is of a fall feeling in the Bay. Perhaps I'm feeling just a tad melancholic.

Or perhaps it's just a damn good song.
