In the sixth month of the prior year, I endeavored to blog once per day for the entire month. Seeing how this blog is currently collecting figurative dust, I feel like I should try this again. Some days shall be easier than others as the [anime convention](http://tokyointulsa.com/) happens this month. Additionally, I shall be taking a trip to Dallas with my dad and brothers to partake in the excitingness that is Six Flags over Texas. I quite enjoy the thrill of rollar coasters, I do.

Now, I'm a bit drunk at the moment and the room is quite spinning, so this blog shall have to remain as it is, but expect there to be _something_ on the face of this blog every day for the month of July. I will leave off with the first thing that came up for a google image search of "drunk".
