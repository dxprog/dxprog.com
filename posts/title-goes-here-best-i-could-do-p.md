Some interesting things happened today (we had burgers for supper, that in itself makes it interesting ;-)).

Firstly, my Empire game is coming along nicely. I spent most of the afternoon and part of this evening getting the random map generation working. That was a blast :-D. Tomorrow I will actually start building the engine framework. This is the part where I generally choke, but I feel pretty motivated :-). I've never really done anything to this degree (and this clean) in C++.

Secondly, I got to evict a wasp nest hanging up in one of the windows. It was kind of cool (and scary). Luckily, we've got some nasty spray that kills on contact. A couple of spritzes upwards and it started raining wasps. One tried to retaliate, but then it died ;-).

Thirdly, somebody is coming to see the house tomorrow morning (day 6 on the market, about day 4 for actually having the sign up). So that means more cleaning and evacuation and since school starts locally tomorrow we're going to be the odd ones out. Figures :-P. But, all in all, I don't really mind. The more people who look at the house the greater our odds of selling the thing.

It kind of bums me out that Twilight Princess isn't coming out until next year, but that gives me more time to come up with money ;-). Actually, I seem to have found a direction for me to go. Sometime this year I'll take the GED and then just spend from then until fall of next year, when I'll go to a local college to get ready for DigiPen, on a job and saving money. It's the clearest direction on where to take life I've had in a long time.

Well, that was kind of long winded for a change :-P. Before I leave, however, I'd like to give a shout out to Slazer for reading my blog. You're a cool dude, Slazer ;-). See ya!
