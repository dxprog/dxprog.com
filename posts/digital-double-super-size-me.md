Not trying to be immodest or anything here, but I think this has to be the best joke I've done. And, yes, they really did say that in the stupid movie. I'm still of the mind that that whole movie was all faked to some degree or another (aside from the fact that he gained weight). I mean, his first burger, a double quarter pounder or something, took him nearly an hour or so to eat and then he puked it all up? Talk about a girly man. His name is Morgan, so you know I'm right ;-).
