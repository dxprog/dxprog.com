A while back I worked up a new design for the site and I've been working on getting it finished the last few days. Comment posting still doesn't work and the "My Digg" bar is broken, but I think this is probably one of the best designs I've had in a while. But don't take my word for it, [see for yourselves.](http://www.dxprog.com/pics/new_design.png) The comic page is also done in this style, though it's not quite working yet.
