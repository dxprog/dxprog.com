Alright, first off the name's changed from F5 to Digital Double. Why? Well, I believe that more accurately reflects the intent of the strip as it's supposed to loosely be based off my life (my digital double). So that's that.

As for the comic itself, that stemmed from a [crack](http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/headlines/H_3155/35.shtml#headline) induced conversation I had with devusb last week. This happens quite often. It's kind of scary...
