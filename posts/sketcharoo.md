Remember that sketch a day routine I suggested last week. Well it's back, only not quite so themed. The reason I stopped in the first place is because thqat Midna picture really bummed me out. It sucked. Hard core.

Well, I've actually got two days worth of drawing goodness, so I'll give you the first one:

From left to right:
My Guitar Hero guitar. Take special note of the Limozeen and Teen Girl Squad stickers. Okay, they're kind of hard to see.

Yuna, a la Final Fantasy X

Some teacup from my sisters' tea set.

Mario as seen in Mario Sunshine (an awesome game). I'm really pleased with how that came out. Also, there's Toad. I wasn't really trying to get a good shape or anything, I just wanted something to test my new pens out on. Up at the top is a little tuft of hair. Just wanted to practice some hair shading.
