There was really only one thing on my "must buy" list going into Japan, and that was the Japanese Super Nintendo, or Super Famicom. I don't know if it's been said on this blog, but I love the shit out of Ninty's 16-bit era. So much goodness packed into such small computing power. None of this generic brown and grey shooter bullshit, just unadulterated awesomeness.

Three out of the four are rebuys, but the amount of money spent was small comparing to their American counterparts. The most I paid for any of these was $21 and that was Yoshi's Island. FFVI, which generally runs for $25-$80 used in the States, I got for a cool $12, box and all. Good times fo sho.

If my After Effects stops crashing, I pulled together a shitty video showing the differences between the American and Japanese release of the same-games I have, so that'll probably be up tomorrow. It's interesting stuff, really.
