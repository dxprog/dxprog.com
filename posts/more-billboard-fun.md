I was on another one of my afternoon walks, shooting to get in my 10,000 steps for the day, when I ran into yet another billboard that struck me an odd way. As can be seen above, it depicts Mr. Monopoly jumping out of Hell, presumably after having used his "Get Out of Hell Free" card. Their illegal use of the Hasbro icon notwithstanding, this brings up some interesting notions.

The sign insinuates that you've already BEEN to Hell (you can't get out of something you're not in). This means that you are some sort of terrible person, probably a child molester or some one who talks at the theater. This notion of leaving Hell kind of makes "eternal punishment" seem a little less eternal. But, let's play by their rules and assume for a bit that Hell is indeed an escapable place so we can extrapolate further.

Anybody who is mildly familiar with Monopoly knows that when you land in jail there are three ways of getting out: get our of jail free card, roll doubles, or pay $50. Applying these rules to our great Hell-break scheme - as these seem to be the rules we're playing by - there are now _other_ ways with which to escape eternal damnation. If you've got some extra cash, just be sure to be buried with some tenners or, if you're not, play it like a game of chance, bring some dice and pray to God that you get doubles (remember, you get three throws). Suddenly, your chances of escaping Hell are looking pretty sweet.

Now that we have traversed the psychology cleverly hidden in this image, we can finally extract it's true message: Hell is for poor people.
