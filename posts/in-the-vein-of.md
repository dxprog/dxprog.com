I should stop remembering about this blog thing fifteen minutes before midnight.

As I continue to toil away at the first episode of Hakk's Lab, let's take a moment to look back at the thing that kind of started me down this path. What later unofficially became "Matt Pokes and Prods" started off with this video of me repairing a VRAM address line on an old NES. It's a one shot, so not perfect, but if you're into such things, it has some fun bits of nuggets.
