One of the things that seems to come up with some frequency at work is the size of my bed. I don't know how or why, but there it is.

Anyways, I sleep in a twin bed and one of my coworkers can't quite comprehend how I can sleep in a bed so small. My general response is it takes up less space and I'm the only one sleeping in it (also, it's _fucking comfortable_). I also have a reverse claustrophobia when it comes to beds: the larger they are, the more uncomfortable I am. But, today as I was lying comfortable in said bed, I realized that there is a more objective way to prove my twin bed is more awesome than all other beds: it's widescreen.

We all know that widescreen is the preferred video format of choice these days as it closer matches the aspect ratio of our own vision; we can see a wider field of view than we can in height. Here's some aspect ratios of common video formats:

Anamorphic widescreen (film) - 2.39:1
HDTV, aka 16:9 - 1.78:1
SDTV, aka 4:3 - 1.33:1

These are width to height ratios, so let's take that and apply them to standard bed sizes:

Twin - 1.92:1
Full - 1.38:1
Queen - 1.33:1

As you can see, twin falls right in between film and HDTV, which is a particularly awesome place to be. However, the larger beds are all standard definition (with queen size being right on the money). We all know how much standard definition sucks.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my modern day standards sized bed.
