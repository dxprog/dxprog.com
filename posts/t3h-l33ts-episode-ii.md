Whoo! It's Episode II! Oh, barf, that was terrible :-P

This week we discuss:

Red Steel for Revolution
Global Warming Stopped
More Revolution Info
Hacking LED Construction Signs
Smell-o-vision
linkman's E3 Predictions

Clocking in ten minutes longer than last week's podcast, it's worth the listen (I hope, haven't actually listened to it myself :-P).
