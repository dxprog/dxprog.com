As promised yesterday, I got that comparison video pulled together. Had to subscribe to Creative Cloud for After Effects to make it happen, but now I have more of a compulsory reason to do video stuff since I'm stuck to it for a year. Still, $20/mo for professional video software isn't terrible.

But enough rambling, here's the video. I apologize for the ending. It's just a thing.
