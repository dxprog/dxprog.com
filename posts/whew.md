Just got finished going through a rigorous exercise course with the babies and now I'm beat. Good time to write a blog entry ;-).

I decided to pick up the threads of ACPD3. I've been having fun getting the idiot BSTRs to work again :-P. I'm going to be moving as much as I can to the DLL this time around and figuring out how to avoid DLL hell, too. For a change people actually seem to be interested this time. But I also basically said I'm shooting to make an Anicro replacement and went for the people who use it. A brilliant strategy :-D.
