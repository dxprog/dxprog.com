Punny titles aside, I have made [more](http://dxprog.com/entry/more-billboard-fun/) than [one](http://dxprog.com/entry/walking-for-cash/) [allusion](http://dxprog.com/entry/parental-pimps/) to my walking sessions. Currently my graph is telling me that I had a pretty crappy week last week, but that's not what we're here to discuss.

The [Pathfinder Parkway](http://www.bartlesvilleparks.com/Pages/pathfinder1.html) has been my preferred walking path of choice for the weekends as it removes me from all the loud roads and reminds me of the lengthy walks I took to the bank in Winter Park via the [Cady Way Trail](http://www.dep.state.fl.us/gwt/guide/regions/eastcentral/trails/cadyway.htm). The Pathfinder runs right along the Caney River, Bartlesville's local body of poisoned water, but it does provide that "nature" feel. But, I could throw words at you all day and not get the point across, so queue up the photo gallery!

Its iron/wood construction gives it a rustic quaint feel, I think, and adds to the experience of walking the trail")![](http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_pump.jpg "An old abandoned oil pump. This is just one of many, but hey, it's Oklahoma so it's to be expected, right? I'll admit, though, it's kind of eerie walking right up alongside these things out in the middle of nowhere with their ominous whir and the wonderful stench of unearthed oil.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_oil_tanks.jpg "Of course, where there are oil pumps, there will be storage tanks. But, damn, are they dilapidated.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_car.jpg "Wait...? What? A car? How the hell did they get that thing out in the middle of a forest? Obviously drunk, otherwise they'd have not careened off the cliff.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_mixer.jpg "Okay? Seriously? An abandoned cement mixer? Aren't there scrap heaps or something where these things can be dumped?")![](http://images.dxprog.com/galleries/pathfinder_traction_engine.jpg "HOLY SHIT! It's Terrance from Thomas the Tank Engine! OMG OMG OM.... WTF?!!")[/gallery]

Okay, so it has it's downsides. Arguably the most annoying part is the dozen or so oil pumps, but it's amazing the crap I've spotted along this trail. I will, perhaps, update again with more pictures later as these just barely scratch the surface.
