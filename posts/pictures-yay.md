We went through our grand tour of the house today (second for me) and I was able to snap some pictures. So, here they are:

I seem to be missing pictures of the master bedroom as well as Steve and Joe's room, but that's the gist of it. 

Most of our stuff (and when I say our I'm usually refferring to Jeff, Chris and myself since we are roomies) is all packed and ready to go.

Well, we're getting down to the wire on this but it looks like we're gonna make it! Part of me is kind of sad that we're going to leave this house (I mean, I've lived here 18 out of 19 years of my life), but it'll be nice to move on.
