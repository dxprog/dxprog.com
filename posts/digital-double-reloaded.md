Starting today I'm off hiatus. There'll be a few changes however. Firstly, Jimmy's that guy in the middle. His hair is much easier to draw now. Secondly, that would be Mary on the right. These two things were the main reason I went on hiatus. Thirdly, there'll be a format change. I'm going to do more story arcs instead of weak jokes and sad parodies. Finally, I'll be going with a every Wednesday update. Now that I'm full time at Wal-Mart it's difficult to update twice a week. I figure I should also be able to keep this up once I'm in college in the fall.
