My mom decided to try out my month of one blog per day thing. I couldn't just take that sitting down, so here I am in a [mother disapproved word removed]-wagging contest, a contest which really doesn't exist.

I love to talk about how lazy I am. For instance, sometimes when I'm hungry, I'll just continue being hungry because I don't want to stare into the cupboards and figure out what to make, or I just don't want to clean all the required hardware. Or perhaps there's just no food to be had. Either way, this is a thing that happens and it certainly has all the hallmarks of laziness.

But to say I'm lazy overall isn't really true. I am selectively lazy. When it comes to programming tasks (or anything computer related, really) I'm always up to something. At the moment, I'm up to a lot of things.

**Work**

I have been working on and off all weekend trying to pump out a gratuitous amount of code in a stack that I have no business touching. During one of our team meetings, I set a bar for myself by telling everybody that I would take on a beefy amount of engineering work because I feel I have to prove myself (through many discussions with the people I work with, this is apparently incorrect thinking). That's actually only part of it; it seemed like a fun challenge. And this has shown to be more or less correct, as I've lost some hours just pounding away at the keyboard. The long compile times aren't fun, but I've learned a fuckton of stuff, both about how your [LinkedIn profile page](http://www.linkedin.com/in/conanobrien) is pulled together, but also a bit about Java and a bit more about OOP. Besides, those compile times are easily whiled away by playing the [Star Trek: 25th Anniversary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_25th_Anniversary_(NES_video_game)) game for NES.

On top of that, there's a presentation I need to write pretty damn soon. I have been chosen to pitch web development at LinkedIn to a throng of up and comings at my alma mater next month. I haven't even started on that...

**Awwnime Bracket**

Last year's awwnime bracket only got a [couple](http://dxprog.com/entry/weekend-of-productivity/) of [nods](http://dxprog.com/entry/a-cute-world-of-programming-possibilities/)Â in the blog despite eating up nearly two solid months of my life. This year it's coming back, but we're also running an additional bracket for male characters ([which came with it's own set of problems](http://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/1n5q2t/2013_boys_bracket_round_1_group_a/)). In an attempt to make things actually manageable, I spent some time into moving all my one off shell scripts into the code base proper and writing an administrative interface around that. Additionally, I moved away from the money sucking [giant images](http://cdn.awwni.me.s3.amazonaws.com/bracket/bracket_round1_groupB.jpg?v7) and switch to something [rendered in browser](http://bracket.awwni.me/2013-boys-bracket/view/). It's also much friendlier to interactiveness that way.

**Freelance**

Despite the fact that I keep promising myself I'll never freelance again, the sweet allure of "free money" is too much. Now, the upside is I haven't had to bust my ass on any of the one (possible two) projects in the pipeline at this point, but still, they hang over me ling a large, swinging axe.

**Other things in the wings**

On top of all that, there are still items in the backburner. Fixes/updates to redditbooru, especially the backend service. I majiggered the main part off of a cron job and into a node run task (initially to curb an issue I experienced after upgrading to php 5.5), but now that the code is there, I can multithread that bitch. On top of that, there are changes I'd love to make to the music page, the music page physical controller I've been tinkering with, and the iPhone app that I've begun writing for it.

My plate is full of computery things for sure, despite what I say about laziness. I'm probably heading straight for a burnout, but these things ebb and flow, and right now they're just flowing.

I guess you could say I'm on my development period...
