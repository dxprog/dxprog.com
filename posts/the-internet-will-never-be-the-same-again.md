I am proud to announce something that will change the face of the internet as we know it.... or not so much. Anyhoo, I bring you ["T3h L33ts"](http://www.dxprog.com/l33ts), the official dxprog/linkman2004 podcast! Whoooo! It hasn't been listed on iTunes yet, but it will. Iiitt wiilllll. Here's the topics we discussed in [Episode I](http://www.dxprog.com/l33ts/podcasts/l33ts1.mp3) (excluding off-topic stuff):

Apple's Boot Camp
Pilotwings Revolution
2005 Nintendo Profits
Bob Ross Painting on Revolution
The Revolution's Final Secret
The Reggie-man

Go ahead and take a listen, spread the word and such. Pretty soon I'll have an official site up (instead of just a directory listing). We'll try to update every week so pay attention to the [feed.](http://www.dxprog.com/l33ts/leets.xml) Enjoy :-)
