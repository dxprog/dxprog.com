So, last night my bros and I went to Al's concert. It was freakin' sweet! He played pretty much every song off of Straight Out of Lynwood plus most of the mainstays (Eat It, Fat, Smells Like Nirvana, etc.). For the encore he played the [cellphone song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjJYywFNbuw) to which everybody, myself included, started waving their cellphones. After that he wound up with an extended version of Albuquerque. It was simply awesome. I shunned my quiet exterior and clapped and whooed and sang with everybody else. But, you're probably saying "Shuddup, give us teh pix!" I've only got a few because getting good pictures with the crazy lighting so I'm only giving you the good ones. Sucks to be you.
