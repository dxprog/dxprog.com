Today's escapade into laziness calls to mind that, yes, I have been working at the mines of Wal-Mart one year today.

And as for keeping the customer's ignorant, it's true. We cater to their every whim and at some point, when they can no longer think for themselves, the cashier's of the earth will rise up and take control and we shall see a new era... an era of peace and prosperity.
