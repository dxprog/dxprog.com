Snail mail spam is a pet peeve of mine, especially those damned credit card offers. My mom tipped me off some years ago that one can curb these offers by using their own self-addressed stamped envelopes against them to have oneself removed from their mailing list.

Using the power of a form letter, I've done this with great success over the years. However, I've been getting a little more personal and creative lately, putting my box of [Rejection Crayons](http://dxprog.com/entry/crayola-commercial/) to good use. These are the latest in my wave of "stop the spam" mail campaign.

Incidentally, Squid Girl is an awesome show and you can expect to see my review come year's end.
