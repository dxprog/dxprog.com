Anime News Network, one of my daily internet stops, is hosting a [art contest](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/win-a-trip-to-japan-2010) in which the prize is a free trip to Japan. Seeing as I am planning on paying for such a trip within the next couple of years, I figured it'd be worth a shot to try and get one for free. Granted, my art skills are probably nowhere near the level of the more devoted and talented frequenters of ANN, but hey. Never hurts to try. So, here's my entry for your viewing pleasure/horror.
