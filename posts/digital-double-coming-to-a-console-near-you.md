I mean, hey! Why not? They already have a [Jesus action figure, ](http://www.mcphee.com/items/10746.html) and there have been religous games. The funny thing about one of those "games" in particular...

I believe it was a Noah game. A nice healthy game for young'ns, only.... you needed a Doom cart to run it.

I actually feel rather... soiled to put this comic up, especially after the [one my brother did.](http://game-boyz.net/comic/20060911/) Oh, bugger. Screwed again :-P
