I could write about the small glee I feel over Duke Nukem Forever being panned by critics or about how my arms are super, extremely sore from last night's workout, but instead I'm just going to post this picture I took/made a long ass time ago when my bros and I went to Steak 'n Shake the week of the move. Because I'm lazy that way.
