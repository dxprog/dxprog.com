Pretty soon my site is going to see a "split". That is, [dxprog.com](http://www.dxprog.com/) will be home to my personal blog whereas [matthackmann.net](http://www.matthackmann.net) will be the home to my professional blog, resume, and other stuff like that. It more imporatant now than ever that I create a professional image for myself what with my career looming in the future and, sooner than that, the likelihood that I'll be taking on some freelance projects while still in school. So, there you have it. You now have some time to decide which poison you want whilst I make the finishing touches on my other half.
