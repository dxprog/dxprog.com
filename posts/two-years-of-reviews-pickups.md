So, after that [crazy](http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-reviews/) [run](http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-video-game-reviews/) of [reviews](http://dxprog.com/entry/two-years-of-anime-part-1/), it turns out that there a few things I missed. And I'm really kicking myself for missing these because they were all high caliber titles. So, a few weeks late and out of context, I bring you the remainder of '08-'09 reviews.
