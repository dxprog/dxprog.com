We return after the downer that was the previous post with some Christmas joy! Between this entry and the previous, I began writing in a new notebook (thus resetting the entry number count). But, this is a pretty awesome entry, if only for the memories it brings back.

I'm now e-mailing Chassidy & Casey. Also Dave & Dan. Jeff hasn't gotten anything back from Anthony. I haven't gotten anything back from Leah or John. I sent Christmas cards to all of my pen-pals. Well gotta run. Bye.[/quote]

I cannot disagree; that was a pretty awesome Christmas. Episode I Racer I particularly have very fond memories of. Also, that joystick was the best I've ever used ([a weighted Logitech Wingman, ftr](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963168-0403-WingMan-Joystick/dp/B00000JCSB)). Additionally, in the time between this and the previous post, our family procured our first (modern) computer. I can still rattle off the specs:

Dell XPS-T450 (service tag 72y1a)
- 450Mhz Pentium III
- 128MB RAM
- Voodoo 3 3000 w/ 16MB VRAM
- Turtle Beach Montego II (sound)
- 13GB HDD

I still have the original mobo/cpu in my closet. Ah, good times. Good times...
