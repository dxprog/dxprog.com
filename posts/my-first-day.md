Well, I made it through my first day working in Lawaway. Overall I think it went pretty well (except all the women's underwear I had to handle :-P). However, it'll be nice when I can go in there and know what to do instead of hanging around more seasoned coworkers and have them coach me through everything. 

I just did the math and my first paycheck should be about $326.20. Figuring I get about that much every week (and those are only 25 hour work weeks, mind you) by the time Christmas is over I'll have around $1300! Enough to by myself that laptop :-D

In non-job related news, my Episode III DVD arrived today. I'm not sure if I've said it already, but I got it completely free all because I took a survey :-D. It doesn't get much sweeter than that. I'll probably watch it tonight and watch all the extras over the next few days. Ought to be a nice break from work :-).
