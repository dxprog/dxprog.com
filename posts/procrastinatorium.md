Some time ago I put up my list of [New Year's](http://dxprog.com/entry/2011-to-do-what-must-be-done) resolutions. On the whole, I'm not doing terrible. I'm exercising more, I've gotten an apartment and I promptly gave up in Final Fantasy X-2, a decision we all agree is better for my sanity. On the art front, however, things are less than stellar; I can probably count on two hands the amount of times I've set pencil to paper to do anything. I blame it all on this one piece I've bee "working on" since February.

After I completed that [one commission](http://dxprog.com/entry/dddoll-beam/), I got another one similar only it involved multiple characters from a source I'm not familiar with. But, in the spirit of [_ganbare_](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ganbare), I gave it a shot. And now, four months later, it's stuck in development hell somewhere between the coloring and shading phase:

These are the first and last of what is supposed to be four panels. I like the last one there, not so keen on the first and am less so of the one's in between (which is why they've not been colored yet.

All this said, I hereby change my New Year's resolution of draw more to "finish this goddamn piece before the end of the year."

Even I am unsure of whether I can keep it...
