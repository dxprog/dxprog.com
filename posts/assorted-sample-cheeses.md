Today's randomness is brought to you by Florida University. Remember, you can't have Florida University without FU.

**Rap**
I have come to the realization that rap music is an ongoing attempt to find the frequency of the [brown note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note). Let's look at the facts:
1) Rap has a lot of deep bass notes.
2) The people who have giant subwoofers in their cars listen to rap.
3) Rap can stand for Rectal, Anal, and Poop.
Coincidence? I think not.

**Nicknames**
Interesting to note that I now live in the Sunshine State which is the complete opposite of where I come from, namely the Moonshine State.

Come back tomorrow for something more constructive.
