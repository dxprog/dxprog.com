Some time ago, I did that stupid [art instruction school test](http://dxprog.com/entry/picking-the-pencil-back-up/), just acting like a jack ass because I can't help but feel that there's something skeezy going on there. Well, nearly one month later, I get this back:

![](http://i.imgur.com/Oju5QcW.jpg "VERY GOOD!")

85 out of 100, they gave me. There's apparently a whole bunch of shit that goes into making this "composite score", namely accuracy, stroke quality, shading and tones, and "design concepts". I feel I should have gotten a 0 because I broke the one and only rule... draw **one** subject.

Also, I'm not 100% certain that this wasn't just rubber stamped on. The sheet I got back was a scan of my original paper, and closely examining the lettering suggests that it was (at some point) handwritten because all the Os are different, but still.

Maybe I'll consider this my control and send in another form under a different _nym_, but draw something completely off topic, very badly rendered, or perhaps both.
