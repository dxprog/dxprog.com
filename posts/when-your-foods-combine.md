[reddit](http://reddit.com) is a great place to kill time with somewhat similarly like-minded people. It's a great place for comedy, feels, and elitism. As it turns out, it's also a great place for crazy awesome food ideas such as [pizza cupcakes](http://imgur.com/a/avjMU).

That photo series is scant on details, but there's really no recipe to follow here. I used the recipe on the back of a package of pizza yeast, stuffed into muffin tins, and filled with deliciousness - pizza sauce, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, and mozzarella (the stuff you find in the hispanic section, not shredded). Stuff in a 400F oven for 10-15 minutes (depending on how you like your crust) and you get amazingness:
