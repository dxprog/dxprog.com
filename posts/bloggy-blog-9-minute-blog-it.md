The daily blogging challenge gets incredibly difficult to maintain after a time. Even when I have a big topic that I could pontificate about right in front of me, it's still a mental drain to put the nuances of being dad and husband to baby and baby mom. Thus, in the past, I'd come up with the minute blog post. I will set the timer for one minute, right out whatever is on my mind, and when that minute is up, that's it. So, let's do that.

Summer is upon us and summer means mojitos. I like a lot of cocktails for sure, but there's something about the crisp refreshingness of a mojito when the weather is warm that just can't be beat. It's a trickier drink to make, but well worth the effort and open to a lot of fun options, such as adding fruit. One of the best mojitos I've ever had was on a particularly hot day at Disneyla-

I was actually on a roll with that one, but the timer went off and the timer must be respected. I believe that catches me up on daily blog posts, so yay me.
