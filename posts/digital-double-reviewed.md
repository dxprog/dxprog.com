Well, it seems the fine folks over at SmackJeeves have decided to review my comic. In a nutshell, they lauded the artwork and design (which I thought sucked) and criticised the writing (which I also thought sucked). Here's the full review: [http://smacktalk.smackjeeves.com/04-digitaldouble](http://smacktalk.smackjeeves.com/04-digitaldouble). Now for my take on things.

One criticism they mention is [A Comic for All Peoples](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/73400/) where my counterpart says that the comic is "too deep for a person of average intelligence." This was actually something devusb mentioned when talking about the [2001-WTF?!](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/72976/). Of course, this leads to their other big complaint which is [too](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/92848/) many in-jokes. This is one of the reasons I switched formats, the other being I find it easier to write more story-like stuff as opposed to the gag-a-day I had been shooting for. Maybe I should employ the use of a writer.

As said above, I am the first to admit that my writing usually sucks pretty bad. For starters, any comic bearing the name F5 is going to suck. [These](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54191/) [comics](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/63958/) [suck](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/88991/). Most everything else is pretty "meh" with the [exception](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/116184/) of a [few](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/63395/).

Their final comment in the cons section about "being doomed to obscurity" I've pretty much comed to terms with. There are many people doing this that are a thousand times better at it than I. I've just been using it as a creative and emotional outlet and that's probably all it will continue to be. If fame comes with it, cool, but I'm not getting my hopes up.
