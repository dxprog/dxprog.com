I am sitting here, quite blong, but boluntarily so. For, you see, I have just gad LASIK compkleted on both of my terrible, terrible eyes. That measnt that I can't even b egin to have an idea of what it is that I am posteng (postiung). But, I wanted to say asmuch before the sleepuig pill knowcks me out so whenh I come to I can see just how bad this post atually is. I'm sure it is quite hilarious, but that is up to the will of the LASER Gods. Okay, I shall return later.
