Yeah, so I bought a PS2. For me, this is a rather huge ordeal because hating the PS2 (or anything Playstation) was like a strange sort of religion. I grew up on Nintendo, everything else was just... well... evil (though, I never had a problem with the xbox, go figure).

So, yeah, I bought a PS2 for Guitar Hero which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. It's kind of like DDR for your fingers, but also has some really great music to boot. From great oldies to some new stuff (like "All of This" by Shaimus). Currently I'm making my way through hard mode which is quite a challenge (especially when the devil pinky won't cooperate).

I do have some more stuff in mind for my little PS2 (emphesis on the little as I got a slim). I bought the Gameshark media player for it which'll stream my videos over the network (very sweet) and, of course, I'll invest in Guitar Hero 2. And probably the Final Fantasy titles I've missed since VI for the SNES (which will always be my favorite, though).

Ah, well, I got a little long winded. Guess I'm enjoying this PS2 thing more than I thought I would ;-).
