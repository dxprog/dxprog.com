Yes, "prototypal" is a word and, no, this post has nothing to do with JavaScript or object oriented programming. Instead, it briefly touches upon the one thing I'd love to do that's _not_ JavaScript or object oriented programming: YouTubing.

If you'd dropped the term "YouTuber" on me even a few years ago, I'd probably give you a funny look and call the notion of a career making YouTube videos dumb. But, these days, it's not only viable but getting more common. From [movie critics](https://www.youtube.com/user/RedLetterMedia) to [people who build goofy shit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMJ2MchTSW2kWaT0kK94Yw) to [folks who just test and review mouse traps](https://www.youtube.com/user/historichunter), YouTube is like a television channel where anybody can have their own program without being beholden to the 23 show format of yore.

To that end, I enjoy building things and I also enjoy making videos, so this seems like a logical place to pour my talents. The , of course, is figuring out how to advertise yourself to the masses. Because, on a channel where anybody can have a show whenever they want, getting lost in the weeds of a [trillion hours of content](https://fortunelords.com/youtube-statistics/) is pretty easy to do. One way to help separate yourself from the chaff is simply to have production value. God knows I love production value and criticising those things which don't have it.

During my month long stay in Japan, I actually spent a lot of time in various [Doutors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doutor_Coffee) scribbling out ideas in a sketchpad I'd purchased. This ranged from visual designs to project ideas to show format and all sorts of nonsense. Sitting in a Google doc, I have outlined the entire first season of this show. Of course, that all is a hell of a lot easier than actually, y'know... making a show. Still, earlier this year, I filmed a "look and feel" prototype video that now brings us full circle on this post.

Will I ever get around to _actually_ realizing this? Who knows. I'd certainly like to, but I've got another outlet to install in the garage first...
