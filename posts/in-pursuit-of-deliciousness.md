So, contrary to what one might believe, my at home eatings do not consist solely of hot pockets and ramen noodles (contrary to what my [mother's blog](http://mom28kids.com/2011/06/matts-big-birthday-bash/) might lead you to believe). Being that I actually have culinary skills, I've made some pretty bitchin' things. There was the [potato salad](http://dxprog.com/entry/a-letter-to-my-dearest-mother), of course, but here are some other things that have graced my table and stomach.

I used to make a lot of pancakes in college (with various extras) because they're [freakin' easy](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/detail.aspx) and cheap. Remembering that, relived the experience my first week in the apartment. Also decided to toss in some eggs and sausage because they are quite delicious. The eggs are a little dirty looking because I scrambled them in the sausage grease. Mmmmm......

A couple weeks ago, I got this crazy hankering for a good salad. Just tossed around some lettuce, tomatoes and cheese along with some deli meat I had lying around (it'd have gone bad soon, anyways). It was pretty awesome, but there was actually more than I could handle over the course of several days and the rest had to be tossed. Not used to cooking small quantities, am I.

My supper last night. This is a dish affectionately known in my family as "turkey balls". It's really nothing more than slightly browned balls of ground turkey simmered in some cream of mushroom soup and milk. I also mixed an egg and some breadcrumbs into the ground turkey. On top of rice, this is a pretty awesome meal.
