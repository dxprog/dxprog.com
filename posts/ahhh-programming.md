I've managed to land myself on a project that combines my two loves: games and web. Tryblithe, owner of [CT Square](http://www.ctsquare.net) web hosting, has signed me on to help him with a brand new type of online game... it's all done within the browser (i.e. no flash, java, etc.). That in itself may not seem much of a feat, but it's much more complex than previous browser games including some real-time elements. So that's pretty cool :-)

Nothing new on the house front. Somebody is coming to look at it tomorrow evening, but that's about all there is to report there.

Something interesting for when google indexes this page again: GreenZap is a scam. That's right. GreenZap, a supposed PayPal wannabe, is indeed a scam. I was reffered to it by somebody I know (not even that well :-P) and I thought "Hey, this looks kind of cool". But I've been more and more wary recently because all I get from them is "We're coming soon!", "Almost there...", "blah blah blah...". One of their so called "storez" was Amazon.com (one of the things that got me ineterested in the first place), but here's is Amazon's reply to my inquiry about GreenZap:

> "At this time, we do not accept GreenZap as a payment method on our 
> web site.  
> 
> Also, we have no plans to accept GreenZap as a payment method in the 
> future.  We have asked GreenZap to remove the Amazon.com logo from 
> their site."

Yeah, real legit :-P.

Okay, I'll get off my soapbox now (wait, this is a blog....). Until next time :-)
