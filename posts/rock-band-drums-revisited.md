This will be my final dealing witht the Rock Band drums on Windows. In the last post I said I was going to make a GlovePIE script, but it seems I have been [beaten to the punch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIre8qkQIvs). You'll find the script in the description of the linked video and I can confirm that it works with the 360 drum kit.
