I'm playing catch up at this point and it's quite late. Though I have topics to talk about (one fairly fresh, but perhaps too fresh), I'd rather get quantity content out over quality right now. Let's go.

Candles are fun. I'm not talking about birthday candles, but the scented kind that you can get at Bath and Candle works. It's fire, so that's cool, but it's also a nice way to class up your house just a tiny bit. Also, it'll cover the smell of the trash can, which is good if you like having polite company over. Not sure when I started getting into the candle game, but...

Who knows where that was going. Some things are best left unanswered.
