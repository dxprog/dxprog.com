This has absolutely nothing to do with the [broken English phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_the_needful) that's become common parlance. If anything, it's kind of a riff on my [mother's post from today](https://mom28kids.com/2018/03/the-3-ps/).

In re-writing this blog, I spend a _lot_ if time reading old entries. I've done this before, but I was looking for something more particular this time around. As mentioned, I'm in therapy and introspection is high on my mental processes, so I was trying to identify if there was any particular point where things seemed to change. Indeed, there was a general trend of increasing self-deprecation, but through all that, I began to notice a particular mentality.

I _needed_ to do a lot of things.

_Needing_ to draw more. _Needing_ to post more. _Needing_ to bike more. The list goes on.

These aren't things I _need_ to do. These are things I _want_ to do. Nobody's demanding these things of me beyond myself. The things I actually _need_ to do are quite few: eat and breathe. Everything else is some sort of societal standard or internal pressure.

In telling myself that I _need_ to do these things, I mentally set myself up for bigger disappointment when they invariably don't get accomplished. Part of that ties into the Three Ps mentioned in my mom's post, namely the _need_ for that thing to be perfect, procratinating until the stars align, and being ultimately paralyzed from doing anything at all. That right there is the reason my YouTube channel dreams are on hold while I wait for my garage to be done but that doesn't get done because it _needs_ to be of a certain level of good.

It's time to stop _needing_ to do things and doing them because I _want_ to. And if it _doesn't_ happen, well... maybe there's a reason.

I _need_ to stop worrying so goddamn much is what I _need_ to do...
