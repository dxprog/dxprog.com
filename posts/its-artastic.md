There was one week a month or so ago when I churned out a crap ton of art. Then I stopped. Not sure why, but here are some of the fruits of that (and other) endeavors.

[gallery=May 2009 Art]![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Maya_and_Kay.JPG "Maya Fey and Kay Faraday. Capcom can't turn down an opportunity to have a teenage, female sidekick in their games, apparently. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Hanako.jpg "This is the fruit of me subconsciously doodling the same character while I was working on poses. I named her Hanako, but used the wrong kanji in the picture. Some Japanese person is laughing at me right now.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Yui_Hirasawa.jpg "Yui Hirasawa of K-ON fame. Arguably my favorite character in the show as she's the cutest (in both appearances and personality). I realized as I was watching an episode of K-ON the other night that the show is missing a tsundere character.... and that with no men, there's no place for one.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/artwork/Azusa.jpg "Azusa, again from K-ON. I drew portraits of all five main characters over the aforementioned week, but Yui and Azusa are the only one's I've colored thus far as they were arguably the best sketched. Not sure if I'll upload others later.")[/gallery]

There you have it. Enjoy!
