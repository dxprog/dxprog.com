After a month of crazy coding and hard work, I unveil to the world dxprog media! dxprog media is, for all intents and purposes, just a front for myself and my work.

Speaking of my work, be sure to check out the brand new portfolio section. It\'s a little sparse now, but I will be filling it out with all my best work over the next few days. I encourage you to re-check out my motion graphics projects there as they are encoded in much higher quality than the YouTube versions (and it\'s the only place you\'ll be able to see the corrected [Crayola Commercial](http://www.dxprog.com/gallery/3)) . Also, you get to use my snazzy new video player (written entirely in Flex).

Of course, the blog got a couple needed updates as well. Down at the bottom of the page you\'ll notice page navigation. This is across the board for general viewing, viewing tags, and the archives. Another thing to get the page treatment was the entry comments. There\'s only really [one entry](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows/) that can benefit from this update right now, but I hope to gain some more viewers by shifting my posts more towards industry related topics and some tutorials. Originally I was going to intersperse tweets between the posts but decided ultimately against it.

So, there it is. The site looks more awesome than ever and I\'m hoping to bring some new sweet, juicy content to everybody. So, bookmark the site or add the [feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dxprog) to your favorite RSS reader and prepare for a new era of dxprog!
