Best way to prepare bratwurst: boil in a one part beer, two parts water mixture for about ten minutes. Once that's done, toss them in a pan or on the grill to brown them (with onions is a nice touch). It's that easy and they're fuckin' delicious!

**Health** - I was sick two days this week and felt like not great most of the others. My eating habits were way off, though I was certainly eating less. I did have drive-thru once (at Braum's) on one of my sicker days because I was super starving and it sounded amazing. Needless to say, not much exercise was had either.

**Finances** - The only superfluous spending I did this week was to pitch in for the [Cyanide & Happiness Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/explosm/the-cyanide-and-happiness-show). I'm considering this the other part of my $50 monthly entertainment budget.

**Japanese** - Sickness definitely ate into this, making it not happen. I will take last week's proclamation of 30+ per weekday and apply it this week (wherein I am within means to do so... more on that later).
