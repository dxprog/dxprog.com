Payless, the Wal-Mart of shoes, is famous for its buy one get one half off scheme. Of course, that's a mouthful of words right there so their brilliant marketing team reduced it down to "bogo". However, when spelled back out it's Buy One Get One which is clearly a lie. It should be "bogoho", but then I guess it sounds like some black guy ordering his prositutes around. Yo! Bo go, ho!
