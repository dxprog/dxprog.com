It is with sadness that I type this, sitting in Narita airport and awaiting my flight back to the Americas. On the upside, I get to have a longer birthday than usual. On the downside, I'm leaving Japan. I looking forward to being back in the States, though. It'll be nice to be able to go into places and understand the language and also to have Taco Bell and pizza. I'll leave you with a stupid ass video taken in our hotel room on some evening I don't remember. Sayounara!
