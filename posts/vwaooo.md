50 points for the person (who is not related to me) that can say where "vwaooo" comes from.

Anyways, I have good news! And, no, I didn't save a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico. No, it seems that my laptop has FINALLY been repaired (going on over a month now, I believe). From the repair center: "repaired- replaced fl inverter, fixed latch,and cleaned heatsink,very". It seems I got everything I asked for and thensome, though the  heatsink was very what? Very big? Very sexy? Very... whatever?! I dunno.

Over the weekend I finally managed to snag that which I have been seeking my entire life. The very purpose of man's existance. The driving force of all creatures... a [Super Nintendo Entertainment System!!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/44121975@N00/191885027/) (in box, even). Of course, no SNES is complete without the greatest game ever made... FINAL FANTASY VI!!! Ah, the sweet, sweet days of care free gaming, when all was right in the world.... it's a pity those days are gone.

Ah, well. I shall be off with sweet dreams of snes's and laptops in my head :-)
