Having been sitting through web dev classes lately it's hard not to get the itch to start screwing around with stuff. However, instead of doing a complete redesign I've decided to just improve the functionality. First off, you'll notice that the main content stuff is much wider now. Very tasty. Even tastier than that, though, is how the side bars are now organized. Using the awesomeness of [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/) I am able to conveniently place everything in one column without sacrificing functionality or cluttering stuff up. Well, there it is.
