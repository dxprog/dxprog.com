I was kind of feeling the lack of Tetra's blog features today so I went in and started piddling around with stuff. As you can see the archives list is now sorted in descending order and I also have a little links bar (I can add as many side bars as I want too :-)). Also, fixed a few problems in the message board code and cleaned up a couple other things that had been bothering me for months.

I got my USBC card today which brings to to the following important note: tomorrow is bowling again. YAY! After that I'll be working three days and then get Saturday off. YAY! Then I'll work Sunday and I'll be off again. YAY! (I 'spect that's getting annoyiing :-P).

Well, that's about all I wanted to say. But before I go I'll give a shout out to my coworker buddy, Blake! :-D See ya :-)
