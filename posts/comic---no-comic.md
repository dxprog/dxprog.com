I may post a comic later today, but maybe I won't. Last night I got everything drawn, scanned, colored, etc. and when it came to writing down the dialog I realized the joke was not funny. So, I will give you guys the artwork I drew instead because I still like that. Well, I like how I drew Wedge, anyways.

I didn't take out the text bubbles so you, my readers, can use your wild imaginations and pretend there _is_ writing in them and that it _is_ funny.
