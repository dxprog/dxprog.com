Got a call this morning from our realtor. The showing last night went incredibly well, apparently. So well, in fact, that the guy is going to be getting his financing in order within the next day or so. So that means I will be **movingprog!!**

In other news, Steve's Four Swords Adventures copy should be coming in the mail today. It'll be nice to have something to play again.

Well, that's all I can think of for now. I will keep you all posted :-)
