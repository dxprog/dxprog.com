First off, however, I would like to mention that I have, to some degree, started my new job. I say it that way because I'm not actually doing what I was hired to do. No, I've been stocking coffee the last three days (not today, because I was off). I guess my training will start on Thursday at roughly 8am. More on that as things develop....

Now for my ranting. Whoo! Lately, my mom has been calling pregnant gals "prego". "That gal's prego", "Oh, is she prego?". ARRGGHHH! It drives me nuts! Prego is a blasted spaghetti sauce for crying in ship!! Even [Wikipedia says so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prego)! So the next time you hear somebody disgrace the name of licensed marinara sauce in such a way, do me a favor and say "Yes, that is some fine eatin'!"
