Well, like I said, I got my old Tetra blog moved over. You can start [here](http://www.dxprog.com/?p=67). And now the highlights of the last year:

- [Our old house got "rennovated"](http://dxprog.com/entry/of-paint-and-spackle/)
- [I won a game contest](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/days-like-this-dont-come-too-often/)
- I wrote two [auto-biographical](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/a-history-of-me-part-1/) [articles](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/history-of-me-part-2/) (telling more than I probably should've)
- [We moved](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/the-moving-begins/)
- I applied for a job ([twice](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/the-canon-to-real-life/), actually) and was [hired](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/my-first-day/)
- I got a [laptop](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/laptop-whoooo/)
- I became a [cashier](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/so-its-2006-i-smell-no-difference/), moved to grocery as an [ICS member](http://dxprog.blogspot.com/?p=6), and went back to [cashiering](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/well-today-is-the-end-of-the-beginning/)
- I bought an [iPod](http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21128349&postID=114145540870772689)
- I [bowled](http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21128349&postID=114184015940905673) a hell of a season
- I created a working NES emulator (see above post)
- Chris and I started a [podcast](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/the-internet-will-never-be-the-same-again/) (there'll be a new one next week, I promise!)
- Started a [webcomic](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/l4m0r-the-hedgehog/) rekindling my love for [art](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/various-brain-farts/)
- Got my [driver's license](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/well-the-video-says-all-basically/)
- I've fallen for a girl and been [heart broken](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/f5-pictures-speak-louder-than-words/) (going for two times now, on the same girl even)
- I've become a [DDR addict](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/ddr-mania/)

Wow, that's quite a year. I'd like to think that I'm far more mature now than I was this time last year, at least I'm a tad wiser. Well, it's 4:30am and I really should be in bed. See ya
