So, I have here this blog that I have so lovingly hand crafted in a glorified ASCII text editor. Some thousands of dollars of marketable man hours all of them for free, all of them for me. So, in an attempt to get my money's worth out of all my hard word, I will attempt a blog post every day in June.

It's not like I don't have things to blog about. After all, I just moved to a new town, into my own apartment (all by my lonesome this time); my brother and I are having a bit of a game programming contest (again); more words (followed by some in parenthesis).

Interestingly enough, I am at a loss with what to do with all this "free time" I have acquired. I don't have cool, awesome bros to hang out with all the time and with my huge commute gone, I've got another couple hours added on to my day.

Now, don't get me wrong, I've got tons of shit to keep me entertained. There are games to be played, movies to be watched, things to be programmed, shit to be filmed and motion to be graphicsed. And yet, I find myself spending most of my time just surfing the internet, napping and being bored. Perhaps I'm just on the slow, rising edge of the curve and will get used to it later.

There is, of course, the additional items that I must do in order to sustain life that I did not have to before: cooking and cleaning, primarily. I must make my own food or, if I'm feeling too lazy to do that, must get unlazy enough to go and procure some from a vendor of nourishment. On the whole, I prefer to spend less money for food that will negate my feeble efforts to maintain some semblance of fitness (more on this later).

The most annoying part of making my own food is the fact that I must wash a variety of various instruments just to do so (this is where the cleaning comes in). All is well and good once this is done, but then said instruments must then be dirtied again. It's a vicious cycle.

Okay, so there are some thoughts for today (made it with a little over an hour to spare). I'll try to conjure up some good lunchtime thoughts or perhaps code snippets to make the rest of the month more than just my mundane, [nichijou](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8).
