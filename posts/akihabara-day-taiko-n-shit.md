I suppose it's less "'n shit" and more just Taiko. We're heading out early for more sightseeing, I've slept in late (6:45 am), so all you get today is a video of Chris and I bashing out some Taiko goodness at the SEGA arcade in Akihabara (who gracefully didn't have any photography bans that I could see). Ja ne~!
