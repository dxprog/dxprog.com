So, I found my bike pump. Turns out I stashed it in the back of my car at some point. Probably that time I drove down to San Mateo to bike into work (as I'll be doing very early tomorrow morning).

As I begin spinning up the ol' design gears readying myself for the inevitable yearly update to the bracket, I was scanning the docs for Google's [Material specs](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). Interesting stuff, for sure, and an aesthetic I really like. That in mind, I attempted reworking the bracket selection page somewhat in this style. Failed miserably, but it was an interesting night of exploration.

The thought of a full screen selection page was kind of nice for about the first 30 minutes, but has since lost its appeal. Also, finding the right kind of imagery to pull that off would be difficult. On top of all that, not really pleased with the typography.

I think the better patter to use in this case would be a [card](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html#cards-actions). This will scale better with more brackets, will be easily transferrable to the _other_ bracket site that's been spin from all of this, and also easily made for mobile devices. We'll see how that one goes.
