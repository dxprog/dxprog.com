I've lost count and these haven't been weekly.

**Finances** - I spent the most money I've ever spent this week. More on that in a moment. I have purchased all the Japanese items I shall for the month ($25 worth of light novels and manga). Bought some new shoes because every pair I had were quite literally falling apart at the seems. Also did a small Saturday project wherein I resurfaced my table... and the cleaning supplies I needed to clean said mess. This week I aim to buy nothing other than food needed to survive and gasoline if need be.

**Health** - Still haven't been to either McDonald's or Taco Bell, so good on that front. Only went to a couple restaurants this week, though Friday's escapades were donuts and cheese steaks, so take it as you will. Really have fallen off the walking wagon and I need to be working harder at that (can't let Mr. Helton take the top spot all the time). Yesterday, while walking to Walmart to acquire a sander, I forgot my fitbit half way there and had to turn around and try again. So my step count isn't 100% accuratly reflected.

**Drawing and Japanese** - Nothing to report.

**Japan Trip** - The tickets have been purchased and we're set to go the first week of June. [We're currently penning a document of stuff we'd like to do](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PyQbAA0BFs5QIqFVZ7t9rmRTyDF2qcqoa7qa4AHPVQQ/edit). This is happening.

For real, dog.
