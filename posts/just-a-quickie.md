Just got out of a showing of Dr. Strange, a showing I opted for 3D over standard 2D. I don't regret my choice. It was a sweet movie with crazy effects and magic and some good old Marvel humor.

That said, it's now a bit late and I want a quick way out. So, here's a before and after photo of one of my recent broken NES aquisitions.

I have both of these machines, but the one on the right is the one in the after picture. The internals of the thing were fine, for the most part. The connector was shoddy as hell, though, so I refurb'd the pins with a dental pick. After a little soak in the tub and a little scrubbing, it now plays games fabulously and _looks_ fabulous too.

The one on the left has board issues of some sort, so when it does play at all, the graphics are all crazy go nuts. I wanted to grab a picture of Mario 3, but couldn't get the game to boot.

Oh, well. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
