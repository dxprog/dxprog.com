Found a [website](http://www.myheritage.com/) that is currently beta testing some facial recognition software. You can upload your face and have it match it against a database full of celebreties. Well, I dumped a picture of me and and apprently I look like Tim Berners-Lee :-D (actually there is a striking resemblene). Now isn't that cool :-). See ya and have fun.
