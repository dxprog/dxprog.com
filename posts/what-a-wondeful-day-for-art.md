For the second time in a three days I've had to call in and miss work. This time, however, is because our wonderful little town has been flooded. Since the river runs between me and my place of employment I am trapped in my house. And what a better way to waste time than by drawing.

Mostly some experimental stuff especially with posing, hair and head shape. Of course, the thing that gets me frustrated most is body proportions and limbs. However, I'm pretty happy with how these turned out.
