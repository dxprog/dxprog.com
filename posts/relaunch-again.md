After many, many months of development and fretting over design, I've finally completed the latest iteration of dxprog.com! There's quite a bundle of changes in this version both under the hood and... over it? Here are the highlights:

- **New look** The most obvious change is, of course, the new look. I've opted to go for a super clean look with more attention paid to the textual layout.
- **Unified content model** This means that items from my portfolio, artwork, videos or blog can all be displayed in the same list yet be treated differently for display. It reduces a lot of code and makes for a much nicer, streamlined presentation.
- **Commenting upgrades** In addition to being able to use your twitter account to sign-in, there's now the option of Facebook and anonymous. Also, comments are broken down into pages of fifty (there's [only one post](http://matthackmann.net/entry/rock-band-drums-on-windows) where you can see this in action).
- **Speed** I've done a lot of changes to the backend structure to enhance load times. The average load time as I'm writing this is well under a tenth of a second.
- **Comics** As much as I loathe some of those comics, dxprog.com is meant to be a repository of all my work. As such, you can view the entire Digital Double archive by clicking "Comics" up on the top nav. I'm going to work on getting the newer stuff in as I finish importing content.
- **Sidebars** There have been many tweaks and additions made to the various sidebars. The first I'd like to point out is the "Most Popular" which, as the name implies, is a listing of the current most popular items on the site. Another interesting one is "Last Listend To" which displays the last song I've listened to through my [Music Page](http://dxprog.com/entry/celebrating-one-year-of-the-music-page/). Finally, the archives and tag clouds have been given some nice overhauls.

Of course, these are just the noticable differences. The amount of changes in the codebase are wide sweeping and quite substantial, but will allow for a much more maintainable codebase in the future. I plan on releasing the source within the next month or so after I've had a opportunity to watch it in the wild and fully document it. Until then, I hope you enjoy the new site. If you're having issues or have a suggestion, please feel free to leave comment!
