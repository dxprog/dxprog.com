If you haven't heard of or or seen something on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) yet you must be living under a rock. Where it came from and why it's suddenly so popular I don't know, however I do know a promising technology when I see one (like the iPod and the x86 processor) so I joined the bandwagon. I uploaded my Vader's Day "trailer" as a test, so here it is:

One nice thing is that I'll be able to save some space and bandwidth this way. I'll probably release YAVP on YouTube as well (and other verious video projects). Well, enjoy :-)
