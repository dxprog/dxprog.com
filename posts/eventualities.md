A while back, shortly before my leaving Griffin, my French coworker brought a bunch of stuff that was eating up space in his house and pawned it off to the rest of us. There was no exchange of money, but many [lunch battles](http://labs.dxprog.com/lunch/) were had.

One of the items was a [Japanese microwave potato chip maker](http://www.jbox.com/product/KING132). He'd never used it himself, so passed it on to me to be the brave one to try such odd novelties. I accepted his challenge to give it a whirl.

And then it sat in my closet for over a year.

That is, until today when, in a fit of super boredom, I decided that giving this thing a shot would be a good way to kill some minutes and also satiate my rumbling stomach (didn't work, wound up at Taco Bell anyways).[break]

The setup is pretty easy: peel potato, slice in the slicer, arrange in the holder, nuke for around five minutes. What came out was actually pretty good. They're kind of like a cross between normal chips and potato wedges, crispy on the outside with a little bit of give inside.

I may actually use this thing again and experiment with seasonings. Also, hopefully I'll have larger potatoes next time.
