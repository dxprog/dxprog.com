This is one thing I've never understood: Why the heck does Smokey Bear wear jeans and no shirt? He's a bear for crying out loud, he can run around nude :-P. Or if you're going to clothe _half_ of him, why not the other half? IIRC, 20th Centruy Fox wanted to do the same thing to Chewie.... idiots :-P
