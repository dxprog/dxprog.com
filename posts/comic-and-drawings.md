[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/212739/the-intertubes-part-1/)

The start of a new arc. Pretty pleased with most of the artwork here, except Bowser in that last panel. Missed yesterday's update, but oh well. It'll be coming Monday. Technically all I need to do is arrange it as I've got the artwork all drawn up. Now on to some artworks.

This was going to be the first panel [Monday's comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/211204/bad-idea/), but when it came down laying everything out it just didn't fit. Probably the most risque thing I've ever drawn, but don't blame me. Blame Nintendo. They love their Peach pr0n, I 'spose.

I wanted to try drawing some chibis and something Guitar Hero. This is what came out. I like the bassist and the singer best.
