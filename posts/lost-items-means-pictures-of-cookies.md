Sadly, the mounting plate for my tripod seems to have gone missing which is really putting a damper on my video shooting ability (I fear I may have shipped it away with my camcorder).

So, in the stead of a video, here are photos of the peanut butter cookies I made after midnight last night. I had a hankering for cookies and, seeing as I have barred myself from stepping foot back in Wal-Mart again this week, conjured these up. I make the rules and if I decide I want cookies, I'll make some cookies regardless of the hour.
