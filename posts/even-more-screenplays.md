I was going to make a post going over statistics of the redditbooru CDN (I myself am not aware of the numbers), but seeing as how awstats is still churning through my 1GB log file and I need to be at the theater in half an hour if I want to see Gravity, you'll have to settle for another screenplay I wrote ten years ago.

[quote]RANGER BOB

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Two KIDS are throwing rocks into a lake when RANGER BOB steps out from behind some trees

	RANGER BOB
	Hey, you! Throwing objects into the lake is against
	park rules!

	KID1
	Yeah, so what are you going to do about it?

Ranger Bob pushes both kids into the lake

	KID2
	Hey! I thought you couldn't throw things into the lake

	RANGER BOB
	I didn't throw you, I pushed you

Ranger Bob walks off as kids stare at him
Some people are eating when Ranger Bob approaches

	RANGER BOB
	I'm sorry, but the park calorie limit is 500. Eating that
	will exceed the limit. I'm afraid I'll have to take it.

Ranger Bob grabs food and walks off eating it humming

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Two kids are around a camp fire telling ghost stories
Next to them is a sign that reads "No campfires beyond this point" and a line is marked.

	KID1
	And then he rose out of the darkness and saidâ€¦

Shadow of Ranger Bob rises behind Kid1

	RANGER BOB
	This campfire is illegal.

	
	KID2
	No it ain't! We're not over the border.

Ranger Bob leans of and blows the fire so the flames are over the line

	RANGER BOB
	I'm afraid I'm going to have to write you two up.
	
Ranger Bob walks off
	
	KID1
	Jerk!

Ranger Bob is in front of a sunset

	ANNOUNCER
	Ranger Bob, the supreme symbol of national park authority.

Kid comes skipping across the scene and Ranger Bob runs after him

	RANGER BOB
	Hey you

THE END[/quote]
