Here it is, Tetra Blog (beta)! Coming down the road are a few more styles, and the ability to add sidebars. These can be any Tetra sidebar so I'm going to be rigging up an RSS feed reader sometime in the near future. That combined with the <echoy effect>Universal Document Module</echoy effect> will make Tetra quite a nicely rounded little CMS :-). And for anybody who'd make a rebuttal to that last statement, Tetra is mainly for personal sites or small groups (like YPN), so SHUT UP! ;-).

Ah, I think I shall play some games tonight. I haven't done that in heaven knows how long :-P. That ought to change pretty quick once I have Twilight Princess in my hot little hands ;-). I do have my [TAttack](http://www.dxprog.com/TAttack.zip) game. One of the reasons I made it was so that I could play that again (leagally). Well, at least my bros and people on [tetrisattack.net](http://www.tetrisattack.net) are enjoying it.

Of course, I could pick up the loose threads of [ACPD](http://www.dxprog.com/ACPatDes.zip) 3 and continue the "war" on Anicro Desapro. Of course, for all I know, ACPD is the most used pattern maker on ACC (probably not, though :-P). Oh well.

Well, I got kind of long winded in that :-P. 'Night :-)
