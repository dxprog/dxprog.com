I seem to have broken the post form when I made it "spam proof". I'll have that fixed in a day or two.

In the mean time I am recovering from a... ahem... computer problem. I shall just say this: don't go around deleting things unless you are absolutely, one hundred precent sure they don't have some sort of low-level hook into your system. And on top of that don't go stopping services unless you are completely certain you aren't going to need it. So, yeah.

That all said I won't be having a comic up today. I'll probably put something up on Tuesday.
