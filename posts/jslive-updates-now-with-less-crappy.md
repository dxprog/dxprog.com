I haven't actually worked on jsLive since moving, though that's not to say no work has been done since my [last update](http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-a-video-of-buggy-fail/). In fact, I made some great strides in the graphics department as you can see below.

Not perfect, of course, but much, much better. So much better, in fact, that YouTube flagged this video as having copyrighted material from VisualArts whereas it didn't in the last one.

Sadly, all that graphics code is getting scrapped as I move everything over to HTML5 canvas, so really I'm back at square one.
