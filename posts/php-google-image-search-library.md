**EDIT 2012-05-31:** I have updated the code to work with the latest source generated by Google Images, so it works again. Being that this is a scraper, I cannot make an guarantees that it will continue to operate correctly in the future. If you see any issues, let me know and I will do my best to patch accordingly.

Sometime ago, I found myself wanting to be able to programatically perform a Google image search (it was for album art on the music page). As Google does not provide an API for backend scripting, I wrote a quick scraper that does the job quite nicely. Hit the break for info on how to use this.[break]

```php

include ('gis.php');
$results = googleImageSearch('chobits');
print_r($results);

```

Here's the function prototype:
```php

googleImageSearch($query, $page = 1, $size = GIS_ANY, $type = GIS_ANY);

```

This returns an array of stdObject with the following properties:
- **resultLink** - Link to Google image result. This is the page that displays when you click a result through normal image search
- **source** - URL of the source image
- **title** - Title associated with the image
- **width** - Width of the image
- **height** - Height of the image
- **size** - Size of the image
- **type** - Format of the image (jpg, png, etc)
- **domain** - Domain of source image
- **thumb** - stdObject with information on Google's thumbnail of the image. Properties are:
- **thumb->src** - URL to the thumbnail
- **thumb->width** - Width of the thumbnail
- **thumb->height** - Height of the thumbnail


Size constants are (all fairly self-explanatory):
- GIS_LARGE
- GIS_MEDIUM
- GIS_SMALL


And constants for type:
- GIS_FACE
- GIS_PHOTO
- GIS_CLIPART
- GIS_LINEART


If you have any comments, questions or issues with this code, just leave a comment below and I'll do my best to help you!
