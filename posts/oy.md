I'm currently bogged down by a bunch of various projects and am having some trouble getting myself motivated to complete them. The biggest is, yet again, Tetra. I'm also starting some GBA dev and trying to get ACPD3 finished.

In other news, I finally seem to have gotten accustomed to the grips in my bowling ball. The other night I shot my current all time high of 172... very sweet :-D. I also shot an all time high series of 501.. also very sweet ;-). I'm hoping to take advantage of some of that beautiful free bowling tonight or tomorrow. Dad's got the rest of the week off so I don't think it'll be too hard to swing ;-).

I've gotten myself hooked on Final Fantasy III/VI again. [Console Classix](http://www.consoleclassix.com) is a very, very cool thing :-) (though, I'm kind of mooching off my younger brother's subscription ;-)). I'd forgotten how great that game is. I'm considering getting the FF anthology that was released for the Playstation, but I'm not sure yet. One thing I am sure of is that this weekend I'll be reserving my copy of Twilight Princess... it looks oh so cool!

Well, I'm sure I've bored y'all to tears, but hey, now you get ae more personal insight into the person known as... dxprog!
