I was on a journey through downtown, returning from the library where I had hoped to temporarily acquire some Death Note manga. As I was walking, I noticed somebody washing the outside windows of a building. I immediately heard an oft used phrase of my parents: "Keep your face/hands off the glass, somebody has to come along and clean those." That's when it hit me: this adage doesn't really hold any water. Why?

Those windows are going to be washed regardless of child prints on them. The dirt and grime that accumulate from dust or the elements far outweighs in terms of amount and regularity anything my greasy kid hands could leave behind. And even if these were not a factor, these panes would be cleaned anyways just because of general routine.

Nice try, parental units.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some shop windows to lick.
