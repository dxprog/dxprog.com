Due to a bout of crazy sleep, I missed yesterday. Whatever, MOM!

This Sunday, I'll be flying back out to Florida to encourage the fresh minds at my alma mater that working at LinkedIn is pretty cool and a thing they should do. Part of that encouragement is in the form of a presentation I must give. A part of that presentation is an introduction of myself. I've gone through a couple revisions, based off of feedback from the good folks organizing the effort, but it's been mixed. Say more about yourself and your journey and less about LinkedIn. Oh, now say a bit less. It's slightly maddening.

But, I don't really need to do any of this. After all, it's all been done before...
