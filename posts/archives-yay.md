The last real missing piece of the redesign is now in place. Just take a look to your right and you'll see what I mean. To save having a really short post I suppose I can give a general update on what's going on.

Let's see... I'm still a cashier/cart pusher. I'm enjoying Halo's online play immensely. I'm almost to the floating continent on FFVI. I enjoy going to college with Elvis on the weekends, and I'm thinking of moving out. Yes, you read that correctly, I'm going to college with Elvis ;-).

Seriously, though, I am making plans for moving out of the house and into an apartment. A couple of hurdles I need to get over are lack of GED and car, but otherwise I think I'm in a finacially tenable position to pull it off. Jeff also wants to move out and board with me, which would be cool. I'm already dreaming of the awesome Smash Bros. game-a-thon parties I could host.... oh, yeah.
