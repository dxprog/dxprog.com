[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/67780/)

Sorry for it being late. I'm now on Linux and I've yet to get my scanner or wacom working so making comics is a going to be a little complicated until I do.

Not much to say about the comic, so I won't.

I'll try to update again on Friday. I have some scans that I can  use until I get everything working the way they're supposed to.

P.S. Comments are working again. I'm just letting wordpress handle it all since I've got more spam squashing options there.
