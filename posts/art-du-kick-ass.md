I decided to switch gears and move away from the Final Fantasy XII fan art. This time I'm doin' Phoenix Wright! Whoo! Not trying to brag but I think this is probably the **best** artwork I've ever drawn. The action is clearly defined, the body (and all parts of it) are more or less properly proportioned and, OMG, there are **FIVE** fingers on those hands. And ANKLES! I will say that my picture isn't entirely faithful to the [source material](http://www.court-records.net/art/OA%20-%20Maya.jpg), but I'm really not going to be picky. Oh, the original of this is actually 8.5x10 in. so even the larger size you see here is scaled down. I must say, seeing this on a big piece of photo paper all nice and glossy with no loss of quality is pretty freakin' awesome.
