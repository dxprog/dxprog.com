I decided to take pepper spary to a new level and make art out of it. Okay, never mind.

Actually, I've continued my Star Wars [advertisement line](http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs18/i/2007/146/2/b/Obi_wan_Subway_Advert_by_dxprog.jpg) this time combining a complete bad ass with the world's greatest lemon-lime soft drink. And a really awesome, swirly background thingy. Enjoy!
