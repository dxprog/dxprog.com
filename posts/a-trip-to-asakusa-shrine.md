...or six. We actually went there every night of the trip, including the night we flew in. It was a little over a mile walk to, but was interesting enough that we would cap every day off with it. It helped that there was a Taito Game Station in the area as well as a restaurant that we frequented a couple times.

The actual shrine itself is more newly built, being made of modern materials; that's probably because we fire bombed the shit out of Tokyo way back when. It's mildly disappointing, but still unusual in form by Western standards. Also, this place was chock full of tourists, both other Japanese natives and foreigners. This place was *always* packed. Of course, there's a shopping arcade setup along the strip to catch the likes of these people, though it was surprisingly short on non-sweets food stalls, a fact that I always lamented.

But, enough of my banter, you want pictures and pictures I shall provide.
