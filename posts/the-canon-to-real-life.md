It seems I may be launched from my protective shelter at home with my family right into "real" life soon (what is "real"? ;-)). I'm currently being considered for a job at Gamespot/TV.com/MP3.com doing web work for them. Now that in itself is cool but it would mean relocating to San Fransico (a good several hundred miles from here). It's kind of an exciting thought, though. Finally making my own money, putting aside worries of my future at least for the time being.

In other news, I'm getting the parish site up to speed again (basically the last job that really needs to be done) and I'm going to rewrite my GBA bowling program. I've been trying to think of a game to write, but it hasn't been coming lately. Oh well.

I've been having some nasty hankering to play old Mario World again (probably thanks to my last write up). So, after collecting some money from VB.NET, I bought it for my beloved GBA :-). Of course, you can't have Mario World 1 without Mario World 2 (aka Yoshi's Island) so I got it too :-). Now my game collection should be complete (though Mario Kart would be fun and the Wario Ware games look like a blast :-D).

And, this just in, we finally found a AC adapter for the old keyboard and now I can start teaching myself how to play :-).

Well, I shall sign off for the night. Maybe next time I'll put up my next autobiographical installment.
