A little more teaser of my progress on JsLive. Honestly, this video probably seems like _less_ progress than the [screen shots)(http://dxprog.com/entry/jslive-progress-report-and-screenshots) I put up previously, but it does demonstrate some things that static pictures cannot: "motion" and audio.

As can be seen by that video, the graphics have quite some major problems and will be my next area of concern. However, I did get jumping between scenario files working and, in theory, the entire game is playable. After getting the graphics to a place I can live with, I plan on rolling out the public beta for people to tinker with.
