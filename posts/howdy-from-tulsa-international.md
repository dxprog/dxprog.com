TUL, if you need the three letter abbreviation for future reference. We've just sat down and I've paid my $5.96 for wireless internet (sucks). Our flight is scheduled to leave at 4:28 PM CDT and it is currently 2:23 PM CDT so we've got a little bit of a wait. This flight will be taking us to Memphis, TN and then we'll have _another_ two hour layover at which point I will probably be playing **Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice For All**. I've already played through the first scenerio and it's freakin' awesome. Kind of reminds me of [Encyclopedia Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown) (and how much I sucked at them). Seriously, though, it's a great game. I'll probably buy the first when I'm done with this one.

Well, I don't have a plug-in here so battery life is at a premium. I may do a quick update when we get to Memphis, but I'll definitely do an update once in Orlando. Be sure to check out my [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dxprog/sets/72157600180317876/) album for pictorial updates. And, just a note, wireless internet FTW.
