So, Tokyo in Tulsa has come to a close for the year, ending the fourth convention I've been to and the first where I've actually cosplayed at. Yes, I've teased you all long enough. Feast your eyes on the 100% sexiness below:

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_matt.jpg "DE GESO!")

It's a male variant of [Squid Girl](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XED8rrt6EgU/TfS0zX1EqsI/AAAAAAAAAlI/XAmi15NjBOQ/s1600/0008-Shinryaku-Ika-Musume-Squid-Girl.jpg), and I'll take over this squidding planet!

Check out the rest of the pics after the break (there's a lot, 56k warning).[break]

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_avatar.jpg "Not that James Cameron bullshit")
Tai Ling and Azula from Avatar (the Airbending variety). They were part of a larger group, though where those other guys were when I took this picture, I don't know.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_chris.jpg "ME GUSTA!")
This was Chris' last minute cosplay, printed on my printer while I was at work, affixed to a piece of cardboard with flour/water paste and finally attached to his sunglasses. He got stopped for pictures more than anybody else. And free hugs. How I hate him >_>

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_me_gusta.jpg "Mmm... yuri....")
Appropriate, methinks.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_dn.jpg "I AM JUSTICE")
A pretty good Death Note group consisting of L, Misa Amane and Light Yagami (from left to right). Though, I think this L is a girl...

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_higurashi.jpg "Gomen na sai!")
Satoka Hojou and Rika Furude from Higurashi. Seeing these two was a bit of a surprise (but a welcome one).

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_kitty.jpg "The Whore of Sanrio")
I myself don't care for Hello Kitty, but I thought my sisters would enjoy it. Not to mention, watching this person awkwardly walk through the crowded vendor room was a bit amusing.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_medic.jpg "MEDIC!")
The medic from TF2. I don't think this person has a license to practice medicine.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_tf2.jpg "Burn, baby burn!")
Pyro and Demo man, also from TF2. btw, I should say: Two Fort is the greatest map of all time. OF ALL TIME!

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_naruto.jpg "A-ano?")
Hinata Hyuuga and and Gaara of Naruto fame. There were plenty of Naruto cosplayers, most not as good as the ones I [saw at Jacon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8rHf70GFg), but these were okay enough to warrant a picture. And that Gaara's actually a guy. Good for him.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_pokemans.jpg "Gotta catch 'em... ugh, so 1999")
Three various Pokemon trainers. The right one is Ash (I think) and I know the middle one is the new girl option, but I don't know much Pokemans anything. I do know, though, that when they return to their respective pokeballs, there's enough energy create to fuse oxygen and ignite the atmosphere. Cooool.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_sakura.jpg "Hadouken?")
Sakura from Street Fighter. Honestly, don't know much SF either, but she is wearing a school girl outfit. HAHA! I'm not creepy >_>

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_snake.jpg "SNAAAAAAAKE")
Solid Snake... again. I'm pretty sure I've seen at least one Snake at every con I've been to.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_stormy.jpg "TK-1138")
I don't need to explain this one, though I will say the whole suit was damned amazing, right down to the vocoder in his helmet.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_wolfwood.jpg "That ain't no Jesus cross, ladies and gentleman.")
Wolfwood from Trigun. Poor guy was trying to fix his "cross" when I bugged him for a picture.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_yoko.jpg "PIERCE THE HEAVENS")
I've said it before and I'll say it again: I want a Yoko >_>

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_zelda.jpg "What can I say here? These guys don't talk...")
A much better Zelda cosplay. So good, in fact, that the girl dressed as Zelda got second place in the cosplay contest.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_fett.jpg "No disintegrations")
A black garbed Boba Fett? Regardless, still a bitchin' costume.

![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/tnt11_day2_hammer.jpg "The hamme is his penis")
Captain Hammer from Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog. Something I would not have expected.

So, those are all the pictures I have for all you fine people (19 photos should be more than enough to satiate you). I may write some thoughts on the panels and con itself later this week. Till then... DE GESO!
