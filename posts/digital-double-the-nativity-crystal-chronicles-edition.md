Okay, first of all I'm really ticked at myself for spelling crystal wrong in the comic title. Oh, well, I'm too lazy to change it now :-P.

The idea behind this is pretty self-explanitory. Oh, an Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is a darn fun game (not to mention probably the prettiest game I've ever seen).

But that's about all I have to say about that.
