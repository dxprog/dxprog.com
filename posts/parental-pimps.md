So, I'm walking around the downtown area, an activity I've undertaken in an attempt to accumulate 10,000 steps/day for a work thing.

Anyways, I'm walking around enjoying the scenery and weather when I spot a giant billboard. On it is a man and his three young children. I was slightly touched by this nice picturesque scene... until I read the accompanying text:

> Our daddy will sell your home... GUARANTEED!

In just a few words, this man went from upstanding role model of the American family to a parental pimp, whoring out his children to make a quick buck. Does anybody else find this kind of advertising appalling? 

I see a commercial for a local used car reseller and his prepubescent daughter is going on about how her daddy will get you the best deal in town. Is this supposed to make people go "awwww" and rush out to buy a car, or are they marketing to pedophiles?

I don't know. I just don't know.
