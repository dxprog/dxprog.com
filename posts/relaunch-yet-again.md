Oops, I did it again. I have redesigned and relaunched this website. Granted, I managed to go nearly two years without touching it. That's amazing.

So, what's new? Outside of an enormous code reworking to take into account the wonderful new OOP changes in PHP 5.3 and the obvious new look, here's what's new:

- Responsive design: not everything has this treatment (art page), but all the main pages should display themselves nicely no matter what device you view them on.
- Threaded comments: if you reply to a message, your reply will display underneath, [like this](http://dxprog.com/entry/useless-justification/#comments).
- Removal of SSO for comments: no more twitter, no more facebook. Gravatar is also used for avatars.
- Better lightbox: every image in a blog post will display in a lightbox when clicked (larger if there happens to be a larger image). This same lightbox is also used for the art page
- Art page is all pintresty. Because, hey, why not.
- Content reorganization: gone is the video tab, here is the "code" tab with all sorts of random code projects of mine.
- Popular art module. That's new.
- Cloud tag has been removed.
- Archives is a list again and smarter in that it will select what year to show depending on the context of the page you're on.
- Code snippets use the Solarized theme

So, that's what's new on the front end. As stated, most of the fun stuff is all in the code changes. And, for the first time ever, you can see the code that's running this site on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dxprog/DxCMS).
