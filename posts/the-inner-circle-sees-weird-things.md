I live a fairly open online presence. This whole Facebook debacle has nary phased me as the whole point I post things on there is for selfless promotion and narcissistic reasons. I want people to read those things. But, there are a couple things I hand out to only an elite few people: my phone number and the privilege of Skyping me. This latter one is especially fun for me.

Sometimes during conversations, something interesting will be said that sets me off on a journey to Photoshop to concoct a visual representation of said mutterings. The fruits of these labors are interesting indeed and I present them here for your enjoyment.

She had mentioned that she needed to leave and get ham for supper stating it was a "ham emergency". The picture kind of explains itself.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/skype_casino.jpg "My brother was talking about how racist the Indians were in Peter Pan's stereotypical portrayal of the America natives. I had to one-up Disney and modernize that portrayal.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/skype_club.jpg "I honestly don't remember what sparked this one, but the imagery of an owl holding a spiked bludgeon is still entertaining.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/skype_train.jpg "A visual metaphor that I think speaks for itself.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/skype_sakura.png "One of my and my brothers favorite past times is to search deviantArt for super crappy "artwork," much of which seems to be made in MS Paint. Using my mouse, I made this homage to those people.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/skype_knoxville.jpg "devusb claimed this building in Knoxville looked like a penis. I just aided the visual.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/skype_crunch.jpg "My brother Chris said that the bats looked like penises. I just aided the visual.")[/gallery]
