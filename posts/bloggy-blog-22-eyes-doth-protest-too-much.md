My eyes burn with the fury of a thousand suns. It is late, I attempted to run more and faster today, but it's left my body _in a state_. Tomorrow, I'll need to be cogent while Kayla picks her parents up from the airport and I watch the wee baby at home.

What I'm trying to say is "I'm tired and I want easy content". One minute blog challenge it is. Actually, let's make it two minutes. Typing is slow. Here we go.

Writing a daily blog is a tiresome thing, especially when you're trying to do anything that has meaning and flow. My writing style tends to be very stream of consciousness, with very little in the way of pre-planning. This is probably self-evident if you read anything I write. There's _some_ flow to it, but I'm easily distracted. Honestly, I approach a lot of things in life like this. When I'm working on a problem at work, I tend to do nothing for a long time, staring out the window and chewing through the bigger details in my mind. Then I kind of write everything in a blind fury, filling in the details as I go until I hit a problem that hadn't occurred to me. So... I don't know what any of this has about blogging dail-

And there it is. I'm going to do that thing about putting the baby down I talked about yesterday and hopefully get another 5-6 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
