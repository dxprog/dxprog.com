I'd been wanting one since the first one came out, but today I finally bought a stupid iPad. The ordeal went down like this:

*walks over to iPad table in Apple store like a boss*

Apple dude: Hi! Can I help you?

Me: 16GB wifi iPads. Have any?

Apple chick: I have one. Black.

Me: It's mine!

And that's verbatim how it went down.

I am enjoying this thing, as I thought I would. My eyes particularly enjoy the very large screen. Been checking out the apps available and sighing over the apps I have that aren't iPad formatted (lookin' at you, Skype).

Also, I've been looking for options for iOS development on Windows and have a few things I'm going to try. Whilst I may have caved to Apple once again for mobile computing, I refuse to use OS X in areas where I can avoid it.

And just as soon as somebody hacks Windows 8 for this thing, iOS is gone....

(no more blog posts typed on this thing...)
