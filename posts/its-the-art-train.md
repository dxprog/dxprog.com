I'm not dead, I swear. Okay, it's only been a few days. I did make a [comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/202494/) for Monday, though I hate it. Art's not bad, but... ugh.

However, this is not the reason I am posting. Nay! I've completed what is probably my best work since my [Maya](http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/55866864/) picture. Interestingly enough it started out as a [practice sketch](http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/61854617/), working on form and stuff. A few embellishments later it's a pretty cool sketch. Many hours, a few hair and grass tutorials later and it's this:

One thing I'll say about it is I love the colors. It's bright and cheerful. I'm really happy with it over all.
