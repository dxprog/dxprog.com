I've wrapped up my first month of motion graphics (MGR), and with it I finished my sixth month of school. Hard to believe it's already been half a year. Time does fly when you're having fun. But that's hardly why we're here.

For MGR, our final project was to create a magazine layout and thirty second animation for a product, service, etc. I had a few ideas for mine before settling on something that was close to me: Crayola crayons. 

I've never really touched much on my artistic background, but I've always had a box of Crayons crayons handy. I can remember buying crayons with my birthday money (it was the only time I ever had any) many times. Also, whenever we'd take a trip to visit my grandparents I'd always be drawing stuff with a bowl of crayons that my Grandma would set out. Even now, sitting next to me on my desk is a box of 64 Crayolas, and they're not unused either. And, for the record, those other brands aren't really crayons. Crayola's have a distinct smell, texture, and feel that has not been duplicated by anybody else. I don't mind spending a little extra for them. Upon opening the box and getting a whiff, I am suddenly a little kid, lying on the floor doodling and day dreaming away as only the innocent can.

But, enough of the schmaltzy stuff. Before you can watch the video you must see the ad. It kind of sets the mood.

And, now, for the coup de gracie. Enjoy!
