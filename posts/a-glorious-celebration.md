I should hardly have to mention anymore my glorious walk for free vacation time. The graph has been sitting there up at the top of my blog page slowly counting up to the grand total of 750,000. And today, one week before deadline, I have hit that total. This little exercise has added quite a bit to my life, from friendly competition with co-workers to some much needed think time. Now, to celebrate this achievement, I give you some more photos of my journeys.[break]

## Signs
I've done a lot of sign stuff already, but these are things I decided didn't deserve an entire rant.

See what I did there?")[/gallery]

## Graffiti
On one of my usual trails, there is a tunnel underneath a major city street. This single tunnel is home to quite a bit of interesting (and disturbing) grafitti.

One has to wonder where the other five are and if there are more...")[/gallery]

## Nature's Glory
Just some photos of nature being awesome.

## Interesting Oddities
A couple things that didn't fit elsewhere.
[gallery=Walking: Oddities]![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_trucks.jpg "A fleet of ice cream trucks. I rarely ever see a single one up in B'ville, so to see an entire fleet of them whilst walking in Tulsa struck me as hilariously awesome.")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_buffalo1.jpg "Bartlesville, in a shameless rip-off of Tulsa's penguins, has these painted buffaloes strewn about town. But this one has a surprise...")![](http://images.dxprog.com/blog/walking_buffalo2.jpg "DISCO BALLS!")[/gallery]

Thus ends my pictorial report of my epic wanderings. I'm thinking, perhaps, that I might film a "documentary" at some point, but we'll see what happens there.
