Some time ago, video game news site [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/) began a weekly [series of posts](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/musicday/) highlighting video game music as performed by the YouTube community. For some reason unbeknownst to me they no longer do this. So in the spirit of all things game and music related, I bring you Game Music Friday. Every week I will select a theme or game and show three videos from YouTube pertaining to said topic. The only stipulation being that the music must be performed or arranged by the community. That means [AMVs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_music_video) are out. If you have any suggestions for videos or a topic, please leave a comment below and I'll be sure to check it out.

Without further ado, I bring to you the first Game Music Friday, the topic of choice being Dr. Mario. Enjoy![break]
