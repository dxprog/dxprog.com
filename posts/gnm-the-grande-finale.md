As some of you may be aware, my time at Griffin New Media and the glamorous world of [television](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newson6.com%2FGlobal%2Fcategory.asp%3FC%3D121535%26autoStart%3Dtrue%26topVideoCatNo%3Ddefault%26clipId%3D5412940%26flvUri%26partnerclipid&h=1598d) is over. I will be moving on to bigger and better things at Winnercomm, doing web work for the Outdoor Channel it seems. At least it comes with a significant raise and the title of "web developer."

To commemorate the event, I thought I'd do a small photo montage to my old job as captured by my iPhone's camera.[break]

These were some mind ramblings as I was trying to figure out how to do animation easing for [this project](http://www2.newson6.com/sitetabs/2010/). Yes, I could've used jQuery, but I wanted to challenge myself and avoid another 50k include.

Back in October of 2010, the station underwent a huge rebranding (websites were included, of course) and with it some reconstruction of the various station sets. I managed to waltz in on the weather area as it was being updated and snapped some photos.

One of my co-workers celebrated her five year anniversary, so the rest of the team decked out her desk in crazy amounts of streamers (in secret, of course).

One of the last major projects I was to undertake was an overhaul of our SharePoint project management stuff. This was me trying to figure out how to make SP intuitive and not ugly. Not an easy task.

The parting image I left on my whiteboard. Many of my co-workers are indeed jelly, and I do not blame them.
