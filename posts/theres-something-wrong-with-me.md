Because I completed yet _another_ work of art!

Overall I'm pretty pleased with it. It's a far sight better than the original pencil art I had. However, the top part of the body seems to be a bit too small compared to everythiong else. But, considering I don't draw girls very often I'll give myself a break. I suppose it's one of those things I'll need to work on eventually.

This whole mess of pictures actually comes from one piece of art I'd drawn a while back for a comic (the point of which now escapes me). I've enjoyed being able to make purty art again and I may keep it up just to keep me busy until September.

Speaking of which, I've begun searching for a roommate. I've e-mailed a couple guys now and I hope to hear back from some one. Also, I'm pretty darn sure that I'll be adding animation as a second degree. Drawing these pictres has really hit home that, hey, I'm not _that_ bad of an artist and, most importantly, I had a hell of a time doing it. So I'll need to e-mail them and see how much it'll cost me to tack that on. That'd also mean spending twice as long at school, but it's so freakin' cool that's hardly a problem ;-).
