It is the eve of the beginning of my PHP/MySQL class. Of course, we should all know by now that CMS programming is child's play for me. However, seeing as my final project for this class _is_ a CMS with front end, I'm taking this opportunity to redesign stuff, and by stuff I mean everthing (even beyond the site itself). Some things to expect from the next iteration:

[list][item]Twitter integration on blog page[/item][item]A proper portfolio[/item][item]Accross the board branding[/item][item]Page navigation[/item][item]Probably more as I think of it[/item][/list]

If my rebrand goes as well as I hope, I shouldn't be updating the design for some time. Geez, we [haven't](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/more-site-updates) [heard](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/the-new-design-is-here) [_that_](http://www.dxprog.com/entry/redesign-the-reason) before, have we?
