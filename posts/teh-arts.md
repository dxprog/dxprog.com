Last couple days I decided to actually DO something and crack out my Prismas and create beautiful masterpiec es that will be remembered long after I die. Or something.

It's [the Cheat!](http://www.homestarrunner.com/vcr_cheat.html) Isn't he cute? He is until he gnaws your face off, that is.

Some kid and a frog off the cover of a book my little brothers and sisters got from the library. I was originally just going to draw the kid (which I only drew because that's what was in front of my face), but the crowd that had gathered around me started chanting for the frog. So I drew the frog. Whatever.

Stay tuned for some more awesome stuff. Awesome stuff that isn't wierd kids and flying frogs.
