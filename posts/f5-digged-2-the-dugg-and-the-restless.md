Note - I was originally going to call Kevin a mustard in that last frame (only not quite as nice), however, I thought it would be more in character for him to swear.

Note 2 - Oh, and since I don't know what the heck Keith looks like, I decided to have Gabe from [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) make a cameo appearance. I may do things like that from time to time. 'Tis fun ;-)
