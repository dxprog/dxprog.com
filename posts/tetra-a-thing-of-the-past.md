Yeah, seems like a crazy proposition considering how much time and effort I've stuffed into it, but I may be moving on to something new. I've been seeing a lot about Ajax, some fancy JScript/XML stuff that basically eliminates page loading, and I may take a shot at basing my new engine around this. Of course, it's just an idea at the moment.

Currently, I've been starting a new game. It'll basically be a Windows version of the old strategy game, Empire. I've been messing around with D3D8 the last couple days and I finally got all the rendering stuff done this morning (yay!).

In the land of house-stuffs, somebody else is coming to see the place tomorrow. We don't know the details because Dad couldn't catch much of the call (due to noisy little kids). Something about they'll call again, they're from California, blah blah blah. So we'll have to vacate again, but if it means we get that house we've bid on, who cares :-).
