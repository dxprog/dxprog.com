[Comic](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/98063/)

I actually drew this back towards the beginning of the comic, but I never actually finished it because I didn't like Jimmy's running stance. It seems a little out of place now that Jimmy is the straight man, but it's a comic. I would've put the comic I started today up, but I want to spend a little extra time making this series look decent. So there you have it.
