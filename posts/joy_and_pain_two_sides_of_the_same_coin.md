I do not go to work today. This is something to be joyous about. However, it was not meant to be this way. Thanks to my wonderful shoes, which have been possesed by the very soul of Satan himself, my foot is in pain. It sucks. Actually, it's sad more than it sucks for today was supposed to be the last Saturday I ever work at Wal-Mart.

This Friday, July 6th, marks my final day there. There is indeed light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. I've already planned a few things I am going to do before school starts. Theyare as follows:

- Attend a "Weird Al" concert
- Start up a new comic
- Practice piano
- Read some books
- Other various sundries

Yes. This will be like the most awesome summer EVAR!
