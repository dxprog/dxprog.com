Some time ago, I came to the realization that I could (for free) check out movies from the local library. As convenience would have it, the library is about half a mile from my place of work, so it provides an excellent reason to get in some exercise during my lunch break.

Last week - on one of these very journeys - I was perusing the blu-ray section and ran across a couple of films. One I'd seen, the other not: _2001: A Space Odyssey_  and _Blade Runner_ respectively. Now, I shouldn't have to remind you of my [feelings for _2001_](http://dxprog.com/comic/2000wtf/), but I thought perhaps my six years of maturation since having watched it initially may have changed things. _Blade Runner_ I picked up partially based on glowing reviews from a coworker, partially because I felt I was going to need some badass 80s action movie to pick me up after rewatching _2001_.

Well, I fucked that one up.

_2001_ was watched first and, for the most part, my feelings towards the movie are mostly the same; it's slow, it doesn't make much sense, but the special effects are quite incredible for the time. About half way through the movie, I threw up my arms in defeat and got wasted. Inebriation didn't help much my enjoyment of the movie nor did it provide any epiphanies (I suspect that only getting stoned is going to help you there). But, that was okay. I knew going in about what to expect and I still had some Harrison Ford awesomeness to look forward to.

Only I didn't.

Because, in many ways, _2001_ and _Blade Runner_ are very similar movies: they're both slow, they both don't make much sense, and they both have very good effects for their time. I went into _Blade Runner_ expecting an action flick starring one of the best action stars of all time - something akin to Die Hard - but, instead I got a noir film set in a dystopian future that focuses on android's rights. Not what I was expecting at all.

I won't lie - and keeping in mind what I was expecting - I did not very much enjoy _Blade Runner_. Firstly, I'm not entirely partial to dark films (both figuratively and literally in this case) and I'll give _2001_ props for at least being a hopeful movie. Secondly, the soundtrack for _Blade Runner_ is so 80s psychedelic that it almost made me feel like I was tripping balls despite the fact that I was entirely sober for that film. _2001_, on the other hand, uses nothing but classical music for its score, so point again. Finally, _Blade Runner_'s basic premise of "what are the rights of a manufactured life form" has been done [time](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor) and [again](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Data). Also, while I did say it didn't make much sense, _Blade Runner_ was at least a bit easier to piece together than _2001_.

As much as it pains me to say this, I have to say that I enjoyed _2001_ much more than _Blade Runner_. I don't necessarily hate _Blade Runner_, but it's just not a movie suited to my tastes.
