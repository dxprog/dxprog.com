Somehow, I found myself poking around in the darker corners of my backup drive today. I don't even remember the original reason I hooked the thing up, but as is wont to happen, I headed in a downward spiral into my past. I like to use these things as a measuring stick to measure not only my progress as a professional, but also as a person. To that latter point, the jury's out on whether I've changed at all...

To be fair, there are some interesting things I ran across that I'd like to feature sometime. But, that'd be too much effort and I'm more about the self-deprecation.
