Sew, you are probably aware that I am going to a convention and [cosplaying](http://dxprog.com/entry/getting-fit-to-look-less-nerdy-to-look-more-nerdy-at-a-nerd-convention) this year. Using a sewing machine kindly borrowed from my sisters, I laid down the first stitches to that end today.

I spent the first thirty minutes battling the contraption before I decided to just google the damn thing. I eventually stumbled upon some [scrap book sewing how to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEvMTv2xVg) that happened to be using mostly the same model of machine I had (same machine, different paint job).

After watching all twentyish minutes of tutorial, I was finally up and running and created a successful debug output piece.

With all the pre-work out of the way, I got started on one of the pieces. It turned out pretty shitty and I've got nine more to go...
