It seems my comic has finally gained a little bit of recognition. That's right, I was featured on this week's [webcomic pick of the week](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/22/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-16-22-2006) poll on [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com). Not only that, however, but people actually commented on it (see comments 11-13, 12 is my favorite). Now, I can't brag too much because Chris has been on [there](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/10/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-june-4-10-2006/) [twice](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/15/weekly-webcomic-wrapup-july-9-15-2006/). Still, it's a pretty awesome feeling to be noticed on one of the internet's biggest game news sites. Anyhoo, since I'll be having guests I've gone through all the trouble of pulling together the RSS feed for the comic (use the icon above, or IE7's handy little dropdown box).
