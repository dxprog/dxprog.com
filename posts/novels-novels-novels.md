I thought I'd post today about what novels I am currently reading.  I’ll also include the read-alouds I'm doing with the four hundred college kids since I am actually reading those.

_## School Read Alouds:_

A Presentation on Web Development at LinkedIn (for Full Sail)

_## Personal Reading:_

Attack on Titan
Game of Thrones
Puella Magi Oriko Magica

_## Books I've Finished Reading:_

Boys of Summer (an unpublished novel written by my old boss, good shit)

So that’s what's in piles around the house. What I'm really missing right now is a good, solid nap. The only sleeping I do is about five hours overnight and my daily nap and that makes me sad. I miss those toddler/preschool/teenager days of sleeping till noon.

What about you – sleeping well?
