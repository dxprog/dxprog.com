As promised, here are pictures of the swag I purchased over the weekend.

These are the contents of two grab bags I picked up. Nothing terribly interesting, I suppose. And the j-rap CD is just as bad as the cover might lead one to think.

This show is pretty hilarious and not very popular (that I know of), so I was surprised to see this at all.

And this is the purchase that has me seriously questioning my life. As I was unfurling it, I began to realize that I had just doomed myself to a life of perpetual virginity. Either that or I'm going to have to find a very forgiving girlfriend.

Very, very forgiving.
