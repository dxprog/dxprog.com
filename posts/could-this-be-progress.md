Some moons ago, I had a little comic entitled [Digital Double](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/). It was terrible, but I found myself reading through it again one day not too long ago for whatever reason. One comic in particular intrigued me as I was attempting to [take a stab](http://digitaldouble.smackjeeves.com/comics/54170/anime-tracy/) at "anime style", an in joke to a couple of sudden character design changes I'd made. Here is the panel in question:

Now, one thing that intrigues me about this picture is that, at the time, I absolutely despised anime and all arts Japanese. That being said, I do not remember using much of anything as far as reference to even attempt to match the style. Just slap on some large, shiny eyes and a pleated skirt. DONE!

I thought it might be fun to revisit this frame and, given that I am actually attempting to draw in this style seriously, envision it as it should have been.[break]

I did take a couple of artistic liberties, changing hair, clothing and pose, but it's kind of nice to see that in the four years since I drew the original picture my drawing skills have made some headway. Quite a lot, actually. Granted it's not perfect, and I've a long ways to go, but the feeling is comforting nonetheless.
