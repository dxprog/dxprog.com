Our realtor called today and apparently we should've been packing a week ago because now we're left with exactly one week to pack! So, I've been going through my stuff today (nuked a few CDs :-D) and getting ready.

Yesterday was the first night of bowling and a good night of bowling it was. The first two games were sort of ehhhh, but the last game was my best yet. I'll let the image speak for itself (haven't tested this Tetra feature, so it's overdue ;-)):

Yeah, 207! My dad was only 18 ahead of me at 225 (I beat him the first game :-D). If this had been last year I would've gotten my 100 pins over average watch. Pooh :-P. 

Well, with the moving and all, it may be a while until I can put anything up. I'll try to squeak out a little blurb before I have to pack my computer. Cheers :-)
