I won't comment on Friday's comment as it's fairly self explanitory (if you've seen Lord of the Rings and are male, that is). So I will bare my soul on today's comic which touches on a topic very, very close to my heart. Yes... cookies. Anybody who knows me knows that I am the Cookie King. When the holiday baking begins and the cookies are stockpiled in the freezer I begin siphoning deliciousness from this _motherlode_ much to the dismay of everybody else come Christmas day. Would I kill Famous Amos for his _ginormous_ stockpile of chocochunkeroos? Yes... yes I would. And again if I had to!!
