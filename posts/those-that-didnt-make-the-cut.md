With only two more blog posts to go and only having missed one day, I'm digging into cheap content to fill this space. Perhaps it'd be more challenging to actually create new content for an entire month, but I'm too lazy for that.

Instead, you get random scraps of things I started and never completed from my sketch books. So, yeah. Enjoy that. Or have a beer. Or have a beer and then enjoy that.

This was the first thing I drew with the complimentary box of Crayons I got from Crayola. I was not in the least bit bitter.[break]

I had an idea for a Animal Crossing/Godfather crossover comic. This is all that was ever really drawn.

Sketch of my Hanako character. This isn't terrible, so I'm not sure why I never finished it.

Hanako in various different poses and styles. Also, I have a penchant for sundresses.

If I recall, this was another doodle based upon something said by the wonderful [devusb](http://dxprog.com/comic/dark-over-light/).

Me failing at drawing females. This can only be a cross dressing man.

Taiga from Toradora. There's a half colored version of this somewhere on my backup drive.

Well, only one more day to go. No, make that two. 

I'll make up for the day I missed.
