Okay, so heaven isn't rejoicing the fact that I've got the site running under good ol' dxprog power but I hate thinking up titles. As you can see comments and categories are back. You can't necessarily comment yet, but things are in place for it. Also archives are gone at the moment but those should be up tonight sometime. It'll be the first thing I work on after I get back from work. Until then enjoy what is and forever will be... PurpleFusion!
