Well, it's once again that time of year. Wait... I've never done this before.

In celebration of the upcoming Easter season, I have gone and hidden an easter egg right here my little ol' website. I task you, my wonderful viewers, to find this easter egg and, once you've found it, post either a screen shot or description of the egg right here in the comments. The first person to find it just very well may get a prize of some sort (maybe an old game I don't want or a drawing or whatever).

SO! Put on your detective eyes and clicking things, scrutinizing pixels, inspecting source code, whatever. How will you know you've found it? Oh, trust me. You'll know...

Good luck!
